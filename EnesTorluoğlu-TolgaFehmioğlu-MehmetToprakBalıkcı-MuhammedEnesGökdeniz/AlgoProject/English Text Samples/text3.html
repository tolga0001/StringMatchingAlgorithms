<p class="p1">“THE CURSE OF CLIFTON; OR, THE WIDOWED BRIDE” will be found, on perusal</p>
<p class="p1">by all, to be equal, if not superior, to any of the previous works by</p>
<p class="p1">the celebrated American authoress, Mrs. Emma D. E. N. Southworth, who is</p>
<p class="p1">now conceded by critics to be the most popular female writer living, and</p>
<p class="p1">her works to be among the greatest novels in the English language, as</p>
<p class="p1">well as the most splendid pictures of American life ever written. “THE</p>
<p class="p1">CURSE OF CLIFTON” shows all the grace, vigor, and absorbing interest to</p>
<p class="p1">be found in “Ishmael” and “Self-Raised,” her last two works, and places</p>
<p class="p1">Mrs. Southworth in the front rank of living novelists. The same</p>
<p class="p1">indescribable charm pervades all her works, which can only emanate from</p>
<p class="p1">a female mind, and the excellences of “THE CURSE OF CLIFTON” are many</p>
<p class="p1">and great. It is a model book—graphic, brilliant and original. The</p>
<p class="p1">romance is glowing and bold, possessing an absorbing interest that can</p>
<p class="p1">attach only to real existences and life-like portraitures. The</p>
<p class="p1">characters are beautifully drawn, and the novel throughout is highly</p>
<p class="p1">exciting and of unexceptionable moral tendency. It ought to be read by</p>
<p class="p1">everybody in the cheap form in which it is now issued.</p>

<p class="p1">Upon a glorious morning, in the mid-summer of 18—, two equestrian</p>
<p class="p1">travellers spurred their horses up the ascent of the Eagle’s Flight, the</p>
<p class="p1">loftiest and most perilous pass of the Alleghanies.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Though the sun was near the meridian, and all the sky above was “darkly,</p>
<p class="p1">deeply, beautifully blue,” and perfectly clear, yet all the earth</p>
<p class="p1">beneath was covered by a thick, low-lying fog.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">On reaching the highest point of the pass, both travellers drew rein and</p>
<p class="p1">paused, looking—North, South, East, West—over the ocean of vapor rolling</p>
<p class="p1">from horizon to horizon below them! And while they so pause, let us</p>
<p class="p1">catch that nearly vertical ray of the sun that falls upon them, lighting</p>
<p class="p1">up the group like fire above the fog, and daguerreotype them as they</p>
<p class="p1">stand.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Both are young men of about the same age, probably twenty-five; both are</p>
<p class="p1">well mounted upon fine bay horses, and both wear the undress uniform of</p>
<p class="p1">the ———— Regiment of Cavalry; and here all resemblance between them</p>
<p class="p1">ceases.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">He on the right hand, who holds in his horse’s head with so tight a</p>
<p class="p1">rein, causing the gallant steed to arch his beautiful neck so</p>
<p class="p1">gracefully, while he lets fly a falcon-glance around the shrouded</p>
<p class="p1">horizon, is Archer Clifton, of Clifton, now holding the rank of Captain</p>
<p class="p1">in the —— Regiment of Cavalry. His form is of middle size, strongly</p>
<p class="p1">built, yet elegantly proportioned. His complexion is dark and bronzed as</p>
<p class="p1">by exposure; his features are Roman; his hair and whiskers trimly cut,</p>
<p class="p1">are of the darkest chestnut, with what painters call _cool_ lights,</p>
<p class="p1">which is to say, that there is no warmth of coloring even where the sun</p>
<p class="p1">lights. Indeed, there is no warmth about the looks of the whole man. His</p>
<p class="p1">eyes are singularly beautiful and brilliant, combining all those dark,</p>
<p class="p1">shifting, scintillating, prismatic hues, that would drive an artist mad,</p>
<p class="p1">for want of colors to portray, or an author to despair, for lack of</p>
<p class="p1">words to describe. He wears the dark blue uniform of his regiment, and</p>
<p class="p1">manages his noble charger with the ease and grace only to be found in</p>
<p class="p1">the accomplished cavalry officer.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">He upon the left hand, who, with languid air and loosened rein, inclines</p>
<p class="p1">his body forward, permitting his graceful horse to droop his head and</p>
<p class="p1">scent the earth, as in quest of herbage, is Francis Fairfax, of Green</p>
<p class="p1">Plains, a Lieutenant in the company under the command of Captain</p>
<p class="p1">Clifton. He is of about the same height of Clifton, but his figure is</p>
<p class="p1">slender almost to fragility. His features are delicate and piquant. His</p>
<p class="p1">complexion is fair and transparent. His hair is also very fair, and</p>
<p class="p1">waves off from a forehead so snowy, round and smooth, as to seem</p>
<p class="p1">child-like, especially with those clear blue eyes, that now brood</p>
<p class="p1">roguishly under their golden lashes, as in profound quest of mischief,</p>
<p class="p1">and now light up and sparkle with fun and frolic. He _miss_manages his</p>
<p class="p1">spoiled pet of a steed with the charming _insouciance_, only to be seen</p>
<p class="p1">in the amateur poet, painter, player, musician, etc., etc., etc. And yet</p>
<p class="p1">there is sometimes an earnest, thoughtful aspect about the youth, that</p>
<p class="p1">surprises one into the suspicion that all his levity is superficial, and</p>
<p class="p1">hides his deeper and better nature, as stubble sometimes covers and</p>
<p class="p1">conceals a mine of precious metal.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Well!” at last spoke Mr. Fairfax, “it is now about twelve hours since</p>
<p class="p1">we were emptied out of that atrocious old stage coach, which, for a week</p>
<p class="p1">past, has been beating us about in its interior, from side to side, and</p>
<p class="p1">from seat to ceiling, as if we were a lump of butter in an old woman’s</p>
<p class="p1">churn, and whose kindest turn of all to us was, when it turned over and</p>
<p class="p1">shook us out down the precipice, and into the trough of the Wolf’s Lick,</p>
<p class="p1">as if we had been apples fed to the pigs. Oh! by the lost baronetcy of</p>
<p class="p1">the house of Fairfax, my self-esteem will never recover the effects of</p>
<p class="p1">it! Perdition seize the picturesque at this price! And ever since long</p>
<p class="p1">before daybreak this morning, have we been wandering about over those</p>
<p class="p1">mountain tops, with the earth below us hidden in mist and only the</p>
<p class="p1">highest peaks looming through the sea of vapor like islands in the</p>
<p class="p1">ocean! And _we_ plunging wildly about in the fog, like death on the pale</p>
<p class="p1">horse riding the waves! And to the momentarily recurring risk of riding</p>
<p class="p1">over some hidden precipice of a thousand feet perpendicular. If this be</p>
<p class="p1">your glorious mountain scenery, to the demon with it! For I had as lief</p>
<p class="p1">be on the open sea with the ‘Ancient Mariner!’”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">To this half petulant, half laughing philippic Captain Clifton, while</p>
<p class="p1">his glance still roved over the shrouded hemisphere, replied, with an</p>
<p class="p1">indulgent smile—</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“You cannot see the face of the country for the morning veil she chooses</p>
<p class="p1">to wear. But wait till high noon, when the sun, her royal lover, in the</p>
<p class="p1">meridian of his glory, shall raise that gauzy covering, and she, like a</p>
<p class="p1">right royal bride, shall smile and blush in light and glory.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“By my soul, I could fancy the lady earth wore this veil to conceal fast</p>
<p class="p1">gathering tears, rather than smiles or blushes! _Anglicé_, I think we</p>
<p class="p1">shall have rain soon—though blistered be my tongue for saying it!—not</p>
<p class="p1">about the rain but about the veil! For, look you! Fret as I may at this</p>
<p class="p1">journey through the mist—yet this fine scenery, under a cloud as it</p>
<p class="p1">literally _is_, gives me a feeling of breadth, grandeur! I expand,</p>
<p class="p1">spread out over the vast area of its shrouded solitudes. Oh! it is only</p>
<p class="p1">on the boundless sea or on the mountain top, with a hemisphere below me,</p>
<p class="p1">that I feel as if I had room enough to live in! And you give me a</p>
<p class="p1">feeling of suffocation by drawing in this awful shrouded world to the</p>
<p class="p1">simile of a lady’s veiled face! But it is not to be wondered at! No, by</p>
<p class="p1">the shade of Marc Antony, and all other great men, who held the whole</p>
<p class="p1">world light in the balance with a woman’s evanescent smile or tear!</p>
<p class="p1">everything is _apropos du femmes_ with you now. Could the music of the</p>
<p class="p1">spheres suddenly burst upon your astonished ears, as soon as you had</p>
<p class="p1">recovered your senses, your highest note of admiration would be to</p>
<p class="p1">compare that universal diapason of divine harmony to Lady Carolyn’s</p>
<p class="p1">silver laugh!”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“I do not recollect ever to have heard ‘Lady’ Carolyn laugh.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“_Ten thousand pardons!_ A Clifton of Clifton never laughs. But tell me,</p>
<p class="p1">Captain, whereabouts in the world—I mean in the clouds, _are we_? And</p>
<p class="p1">when shall we see this pure pearl of beauty and the rich casket that</p>
<p class="p1">enshrines her, this stately lily of the mountains and the parterre where</p>
<p class="p1">she blooms;—when shall we behold Paradise and the Peri—Clifton and Lady</p>
<p class="p1">Carolyn?”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Without replying to this mock-poetic strain, Captain Clifton remained</p>
<p class="p1">with his eyes still wandering from East to West, and back again over the</p>
<p class="p1">rolling vapor. And Fairfax continued—</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“I suspect now, by your abstracted air and wandering eye, that you have</p>
<p class="p1">lost your way in the clouds—not the first time such a thing has happened</p>
<p class="p1">to a lover, nor would it be strange in a place like this, where the only</p>
<p class="p1">land-marks are mountain tops sticking out of the fog with a day’s</p>
<p class="p1">journey between each!”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">At this instant a distant group of peaks broke suddenly through the mist</p>
<p class="p1">like new isles thrown up by the sea, and glittered whitely in the</p>
<p class="p1">sunlight against the deep blue horizon.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“See!” exclaimed Clifton, roused from his apathy by the sudden</p>
<p class="p1">apparition. “Look, Fairfax! I will show you White Cliffs! Look straight</p>
<p class="p1">before you to the Western horizon—a little North of West. You see a</p>
<p class="p1">crescent of seven peaks rising through the mist against the sky. That is</p>
<p class="p1">White Cliffs.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Looking white enough at this distance—quite like snow-capped mountains,</p>
<p class="p1">in fact.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Yes. They are of white quartz, and their peaks rising from the girdle</p>
<p class="p1">of dark evergreens around their base and sides, have quite a cooling</p>
<p class="p1">effect in hot weather.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Ah! just so. Now how far off are those same blessed refrigerators?”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“About twenty-five miles in a bee-line. But the mountain road is very</p>
<p class="p1">circuitous, and makes the distance nearly forty. However, if we ride</p>
<p class="p1">well, we shall be able to reach Clifton in time to surprise Mrs. Clifton</p>
<p class="p1">at tea.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Heaven be praised for that possibility!” ejaculated Fairfax, as they</p>
<p class="p1">prepared to descend the mountain side.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">As they rode down, Captain Clifton, warming slightly from his cool</p>
<p class="p1">reserve, said—</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“I think, Fairfax, that you, poet and artist as you claim to be, will</p>
<p class="p1">rather like Clifton. Tourists, who have visited our part of the country,</p>
<p class="p1">think the scenery there very fine. It impresses _me_ merely as being</p>
<p class="p1">unique. There is something formal—but, to myself, not therefore</p>
<p class="p1">unpleasing in that crescent of seven peaks—the tallest being in the</p>
<p class="p1">centre and gradually declining thence to the lowest, which may be called</p>
<p class="p1">the horns of the crescent, and point Southward. Those peaks rise from a</p>
<p class="p1">forest of—first elms and oaks around their base; then pines farther up</p>
<p class="p1">their sides; and last of cedars, above which rise the pinnacle of white</p>
<p class="p1">quartz. This crescent of mountains surrounds and shelters from the North</p>
<p class="p1">winds the family mansion, which is situated in the woods at its foot.</p>
<p class="p1">North of the peaks, the country is wild and rugged, but partly covered</p>
<p class="p1">with thick forest, and affording the best hunting grounds in the world.</p>
<p class="p1">There you may course the hare; track the deer; or if your tastes aspire</p>
<p class="p1">to a fiercer conflict, hunt the wolf, the wild cat, or the bear—!”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“—Or the rattle-snake, copper-head, or moccasin! Thank you, I have no</p>
<p class="p1">inclination for crusade against those mountaineers,” laughed Fairfax.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Perhaps you like angling? There is a trout stream at the foot of the</p>
<p class="p1">wooded lawn, in front of the house. I must tell you about that, for it</p>
<p class="p1">is the head waters of a fine river.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“From the Western cliff there springs a torrent that with many a leap,</p>
<p class="p1">and fall, and rebound, tumbles tumultuously down the side of the</p>
<p class="p1">mountain, and falling into a channel at the foot of the lawn flows</p>
<p class="p1">calmly on, until it meets a second fall, from whence it goes hurrying</p>
<p class="p1">on, through forests, fields and rocks, taking tribute from many a</p>
<p class="p1">mountain torrent, and many a meadow-stream, and widening as it goes,</p>
<p class="p1">until it becomes a mighty river, rushing on, to pour its floods into the</p>
<p class="p1">majestic James. After which, they both go on, breaking through range</p>
<p class="p1">after range of mountains, and so conquer their passage to the sea—even</p>
<p class="p1">as in the feudal days of the olden country, some mountain chieftain,</p>
<p class="p1">gathering his vassals together, came rushing down from his highland</p>
<p class="p1">home, and laying all the country under tribute in his course, hurried on</p>
<p class="p1">to throw all his treasures at the feet of his sovereign, and go with him</p>
<p class="p1">to the wars.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Clifton!” said Fairfax, more seriously than he had yet spoken, “all</p>
<p class="p1">your illustrations—all your metaphors—all your thoughts, fancies and</p>
<p class="p1">imaginings are—not ‘of the earth, earthy,’ but worse—far worse—of the</p>
<p class="p1">_world_, _worldly_! Of the world, its castes, customs and</p>
<p class="p1">conventions—its pomps, vanities and falsities! You speak of the</p>
<p class="p1">grandest, the most imposing—oh! let me call it at once, the most</p>
<p class="p1">magnificent area of mountain scenery in the hemisphere, with all the</p>
<p class="p1">earth, below and around, covered with a sea of vapor that rises and</p>
<p class="p1">falls, rolling from horizon to horizon, like the waves of the ocean, and</p>
<p class="p1">you compare it to a veiled royal bride! You describe a mighty</p>
<p class="p1">mountain-river, rending its passage through the everlasting rocks,</p>
<p class="p1">overleaping, uprooting, bearing down and bearing on all obstacles to its</p>
<p class="p1">resistless rush towards the sea, and you liken it to a chieftain going</p>
<p class="p1">to pay tribute to a King! Ah, Clifton of Clifton, the beauty, the glory,</p>
<p class="p1">and the majesty of the _earth_ pleases you, but the ‘pomp, pride, and</p>
<p class="p1">circumstance’ of the _world_ inspires you! But when was it otherwise</p>
<p class="p1">with a Clifton, of Clifton? ‘The spirit of intense worldliness has ever</p>
<p class="p1">been their bane and curse—their sin and its punishment!’” he concluded,</p>
<p class="p1">relapsing into his mock-tragic air.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Ah! so you are familiar with the popular legend that you have just</p>
<p class="p1">quoted,” said Captain Clifton. “But,” he added, with a sarcastic smile,</p>
<p class="p1">“were Georgia here, I think she could refute the charge, and prove one</p>
<p class="p1">Clifton, at least, has been guided by any spirit rather than that of</p>
<p class="p1">‘intense worldliness.’”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“_Georgia?_”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“I beg her pardon! Mrs. Clifton, of Clifton.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Oh! your aunt! but by my soul, Captain, that was a very irreverent way</p>
<p class="p1">of introducing the old lady! Do young men in your patriarchal part of</p>
<p class="p1">the country call old gentlewomen by their Christian names?”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Old gentlewomen!” repeated Clifton slowly, with a musing smile,</p>
<p class="p1">adding—“Georgia is about seventeen years of age, and the most beautiful</p>
<p class="p1">woman in the world!”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Whe-e-e-ew! I’m amazed! I’m confounded! I’m stunned! Then—the present</p>
<p class="p1">Mrs. Clifton is the _second_ wife?”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“No, sir—Georgia is my uncle’s fourth wife.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Overwhelmed!—annihilated!” exclaimed the young man. “The—the—old</p>
<p class="p1">Blue-beard! the old Henry VIII.! Four wives! Are they all living?—if</p>
<p class="p1">not, where does he bury his dead?”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“_Fairfax!_” exclaimed Captain Clifton, in a tone, and with a look, that</p>
<p class="p1">speedily recalled the young man to himself—then he added, rather</p>
<p class="p1">haughtily—“My Uncle Clifton is a simple, gentle-hearted old man,</p>
<p class="p1">excessively fond of women, but mark you, sir!—it is the affection of the</p>
<p class="p1">patriarch, not of the pacha.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Hang me if ever I saw any difference between Solomon the king, and</p>
<p class="p1">Solimaun the caliph; Abraham the patriarch, and Aroun the pacha, in that</p>
<p class="p1">respect,” laughed the young man, until, stealing a furtive glance at the</p>
<p class="p1">cold and haughty face of Clifton, he held out his hand, and suddenly</p>
<p class="p1">exclaimed—“Pardon me, Clifton! or call me out! I—can’t help a jest, to</p>
<p class="p1">save my soul! but I’ll fight or apologize, or render any other sort of</p>
<p class="p1">satisfaction afterwards!”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Captain Clifton remembered that Francis Fairfax was his guest, going to</p>
<p class="p1">spend a long mid-summer furlough at his mother’s house, and so he</p>
<p class="p1">cleared his brow and answered—</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Nonsense!”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Now tell me about Henry VIII.’s fourth Queen—how long has she been</p>
<p class="p1">married—I mean the present Mrs. Clifton?”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“About two years. My uncle wedded her when she was fifteen—she is now</p>
<p class="p1">seventeen—and, as I said, the most beautiful creature that you, or I, or</p>
<p class="p1">any one else, ever did, or ever shall see, anywhere.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“_Allons_—stop there! False knight and recreant! whose colors do you</p>
<p class="p1">wear while you uphold the peerless beauty of Georgia? What would Miss</p>
<p class="p1">Clifton of Clifton say to your admiration?”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Ridiculous, sir! Miss Clifton is herself very beautiful but not the</p>
<p class="p1">_most_ beautiful. Miss Clifton has _other_ and _rarer_ distinctions, I</p>
<p class="p1">am proud to say?”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Oh, I understand—her family _name_!—nevertheless, be hanged if I don’t</p>
<p class="p1">believe you have been in love with Georgia!”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Impossible, sir! The perfect beauty of the young girl struck me</p>
<p class="p1">forcibly, as it strikes _all others_—nay, more—impressed my</p>
<p class="p1">imagination deeply perhaps. I confess to a _penchant_ for female</p>
<p class="p1">beauty—and—observe—it is the artist’s taste, sir, not the sultan’s.</p>
<p class="p1">But in love with Georgia! Impossible, sir! She was a girl of humble</p>
<p class="p1">parentage!”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Ah! then you think it quite ‘impossible’ that a gentleman born, should</p>
<p class="p1">be in love with a girl of ‘humble parentage?’”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Preposterous, sir!—utterly preposterous! Pray, let us hear no more</p>
<p class="p1">about it!”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Yet your uncle—”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“My uncle married such an one, you would say. Old gentlemen, living on</p>
<p class="p1">their own estates, will do such things. And the world charitably</p>
<p class="p1">ascribes it to dotage, smiles and forgives them. You will oblige me by</p>
<p class="p1">changing the subject, Frank.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Fairfax fell into reverie, and Clifton dropped into thought, and they</p>
<p class="p1">rode on for some time in silence, and in—joy—until—</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Floods and furies! Fire and flames!! Lightning and tempests, and sudden</p>
<p class="p1">death!!!” exclaimed Fairfax, rearing and backing his horse with a</p>
<p class="p1">terrible jerk, and throwing himself from the saddle, bathed in</p>
<p class="p1">perspiration, and shaking with terror. “Look! Look there! There at your</p>
<p class="p1">feet! Back! Back your horse, unless you wish to ride straight to the</p>
<p class="p1">kingdom of Heaven, or—to the other place! Oh, blessed Lord! I shall</p>
<p class="p1">never survive the shock!”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Captain Clifton backed his horse, dismounted, and following the index of</p>
<p class="p1">Fairfax, approached the brink of the awful abyss, and looked down a</p>
<p class="p1">perpendicular precipice of more than a thousand feet, with the remaining</p>
<p class="p1">distance lost in shadows and dim vapors, while faintly to the ear came a</p>
<p class="p1">low and hollow murmur, as of the roaring of many waters at a vast depth!</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“This is the head of the Devil’s Staircase! We have lost our way!” said</p>
<p class="p1">Captain Clifton.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Devil’s Staircase! I should think it was! Ugh! Oooo-oo-ooh! I shall</p>
<p class="p1">never survive it! Where does it lead to? Tell me that! To the infernal</p>
<p class="p1">regions, I suppose, of course. Ur-r-r-r-r!” exclaimed Fairfax, with his</p>
<p class="p1">teeth chattering.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“We have indeed made a very narrow escape,” said Captain Clifton, gazing</p>
<p class="p1">thoughtfully down the horrible pit.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Narrow escape! Ur-r-r-r-r!” exclaimed Frank, shaking, shuddering, and</p>
<p class="p1">streaming with cold perspiration. “I tell you, when I was providentially</p>
<p class="p1">led to look down, and saw the fog roll away from beneath my horse’s</p>
<p class="p1">feet, and reveal that ghastly—Ur-r-r-r-r! Ur-r-r-r-r! I believe I shall</p>
<p class="p1">chatter my teeth to powder!”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Come, come, Fairfax! this is really unmanly. Thank an ever-watchful</p>
<p class="p1">Providence, that has preserved you from a sudden and horrible death, and</p>
<p class="p1">calm yourself. Be a man!”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Be a man! You might as well say to my shuddering horse, there—be a</p>
<p class="p1">horse! This is unhorsely! Ur-r-r-r-r. I tell you it has given me the</p>
<p class="p1">tertian ague!”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Why, Frank! Really!”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Look at my horse—look even at that dumb beast! Yes, look at that</p>
<p class="p1">gallant steed, who would charge upon a phalanx of fixed bayonets, and</p>
<p class="p1">impale himself upon their points, if spurred to it—look at him!</p>
<p class="p1">Positively frozen with terror!”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Fairfax, you astonish me—certainly you are not really so much</p>
<p class="p1">overcome.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Overcome! My nerves are shattered to atoms, I tell you! Ur-r-r-r-r! It</p>
<p class="p1">has given me the tertian ague, and the St. Vitus’ dance! both together!</p>
<p class="p1">Ur-r-r-r-r!”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Now who would have supposed you to be a—of such a nervous temperament!</p>
<p class="p1">Come, let me assist you to mount, and then away.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“What! And at the end of the next hundred yards, ride headlong over a</p>
<p class="p1">precipice of fifteen hundred feet, and before night find sepulchre in</p>
<p class="p1">the maws of fifty turkey-buzzards! I tell you there is neither a</p>
<p class="p1">glorious death, an honorable burial nor an immortal fame to be found in</p>
<p class="p1">such a fate! Heavens and earth, no! For instance—‘Whatever became of</p>
<p class="p1">that poor devil, Fairfax?’ asks one. ‘Oh, one day, crossing the</p>
<p class="p1">mountains in a fog, with his head in a mist, he had the awkwardness to</p>
<p class="p1">pitch himself headforemost down the Devil’s Ladder, in the Alleghanies,’</p>
<p class="p1">answers t’other. ‘_Poor creature!_ He was always a miserable—but where</p>
<p class="p1">was he buried?’ ‘He wa’n’t buried—the crows eat him up,’ etc., etc.,</p>
<p class="p1">etc.! Oh! I know what my posthumous fame would be in such a case. Quite</p>
<p class="p1">different from that of the future Major-General Francis Fairfax, who,</p>
<p class="p1">fifty years hence, at a good old age, shall die in his downy bed, with</p>
<p class="p1">the archbishop praying by him, and be buried with the highest honors of</p>
<p class="p1">war, and have a national monument raised to his fame, emblazoning his</p>
<p class="p1">immortal services to his grateful country, in receiving her honors and</p>
<p class="p1">emoluments for more that half a century! Can’t give up that glorious</p>
<p class="p1">future for the sake of dashing myself to pieces this afternoon, Clifton.</p>
<p class="p1">No!” said the young man, folding his arms, and striking an attitude</p>
<p class="p1">_a-la-Napoleon_, “I have a destiny to fulfill, and shall not stir from</p>
<p class="p1">this spot until the mist rises or falls.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Mr. Fairfax! It is now drawing late in the afternoon. We shall have a</p>
<p class="p1">storm before night; and a storm on the mountains, let me tell you, is a</p>
<p class="p1">much more delightful thing to read about in Childe Harold, while</p>
<p class="p1">stretched at your ease upon the settee in your shady piazza, than to</p>
<p class="p1">take in _propria personæ_ on the Alleghanies,” said Captain Clifton,</p>
<p class="p1">quietly.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Only warrant me from bringing up suddenly to the jumping-off place</p>
<p class="p1">before I know it—and I’ll make an attempt! Yea! let him only insure my</p>
<p class="p1">body unharmed by fire or water, and I’ll valiantly follow my leader</p>
<p class="p1">through flood and flame!” replied Frank, recovering himself with a few</p>
<p class="p1">more shudders, and preparing to mount.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“We have left the right road about two miles behind,” said Captain</p>
<p class="p1">Clifton, turning his horse’s head and leading the way.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">The fog below was condensing very fast. From the North-Western horizon</p>
<p class="p1">black clouds were rising behind masses of foaming white vapor. The air</p>
<p class="p1">was still and oppressive, and from all around came a faint, low moaning</p>
<p class="p1">sound, as if nature cowered and trembled before the coming of the</p>
<p class="p1">terrible “storm king.” The fog was now rolling down and gathering into</p>
<p class="p1">clouds below them—revealing the majestic features of the landscape,</p>
<p class="p1">mountains, vales and forests, rocks, glens and waterfalls, in wild and</p>
<p class="p1">magnificent confusion—all wearing now a savage and gloomy aspect under</p>
<p class="p1">the shadow of the coming storm. Captain Clifton’s eye had been</p>
<p class="p1">constantly on the alert in hope of discovering some mountain cabin,</p>
<p class="p1">which might shelter them from the fury of the tempest, but as yet his</p>
<p class="p1">search was unsuccessful—no human dwelling even of the humblest</p>
<p class="p1">description was to be seen. At length the attention of the travellers</p>
<p class="p1">was attracted by the faint tingling of a bell—then by the bleating of</p>
<p class="p1">sheep—and then from the deep clouded glen at their right, sprung up into</p>
<p class="p1">their path a bell-wether followed by two—five—ten—a whole flock of</p>
<p class="p1">sheep; and driven by a girl on a pony; a little coarse, sun-burned girl,</p>
<p class="p1">in a boy’s coarse straw hat and a homespun gown, riding on a little</p>
<p class="p1">rough-coated, wiry, mountain pony.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“A shepherdess, by all that is romantic,” exclaimed Fairfax, vaulting</p>
<p class="p1">aside to let the sheep pass. Then springing to the side of the</p>
<p class="p1">rough-coated pony, he doffed his hat to the rider and said—</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“My good girl—for the love of Providence, will you tell us where we can</p>
<p class="p1">find shelter from the storm?”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">The child raised her fine eyes to the stranger’s face with the look of a</p>
<p class="p1">startled fawn—and dropped them again instantly. Fairfax repeated his</p>
<p class="p1">question. The child stole another furtive glance at the fine gentleman</p>
<p class="p1">in the very fine uniform, and then at her own coarse raiment, and</p>
<p class="p1">blushed deeply. But before Fairfax could reiterate his request, she</p>
<p class="p1">said, quietly—</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Grandfather’s cabin is not far off, if you and the other gentleman will</p>
<p class="p1">come with me.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“With great pleasure—and ten thousand thanks, my dear little girl. Be so</p>
<p class="p1">good as to lead the way.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">The flock of sheep had gone on before. The girl put her pony in motion,</p>
<p class="p1">and the gentlemen followed—Mr. Fairfax addressing all his conversation</p>
<p class="p1">to his little companion; and Captain Clifton riding on in silence and</p>
<p class="p1">abstraction.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">The sky was darkening very fast, and great single drops of rain</p>
<p class="p1">occasionally falling. They quickened their pace, and after riding</p>
<p class="p1">briskly several hundred yards, came to the head of a glen, deep down in</p>
<p class="p1">which was seen a small, lone cabin. At this instant the sheet lightning</p>
<p class="p1">glared from horizon to horizon, followed by a report as of exploded and</p>
<p class="p1">falling rocks, and then the rain came down in a deluge. The darkness was</p>
<p class="p1">so dense now as to hide their way. The girl jumped from her pony, and</p>
<p class="p1">giving him a little slap that sent him travelling down the path, went up</p>
<p class="p1">to the head of Clifton’s horse and said, shyly—</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“You can’t see the way, sir, and you don’t know the road—let me lead</p>
<p class="p1">your horse.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“By no means, my good girl,” replied Clifton, speaking in a tone of</p>
<p class="p1">haughty astonishment.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Without reply the child turned from him and went towards Fairfax. And at</p>
<p class="p1">the same instant a thunderbolt was hurled from Heaven with a terrific</p>
<p class="p1">crash, riving the ground on which she had just stood. When the panic was</p>
<p class="p1">over, the first thought of Captain Clifton was for the safety of that</p>
<p class="p1">presumptuous child. A glare of lightning revealed her lying on the rock.</p>
<p class="p1">He hastened to her side.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“My dear child, are you hurt,” he asked, dismounting and stooping to</p>
<p class="p1">lift her.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Oh! sir, I am so glad to hear you speak! I thought you were struck.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Are you hurt?”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Oh no, sir, I was only thrown down,” replied the child, lightly</p>
<p class="p1">springing to her feet.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Oh, yes! Exchange your mutual condolences and congratulations. But who</p>
<p class="p1">the mischief cares whether I am hurt or not?” exclaimed Fairfax,</p>
<p class="p1">stumbling along towards them—for he also had dismounted.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“You were entirely out of danger,” replied Clifton.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Out of danger! Who the deuce is out of danger within a hundred miles of</p>
<p class="p1">these infernal mountains?”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">The rain was still pouring down in floods, and in the interval of the</p>
<p class="p1">thunder, the roar of the swollen torrents was deafening. The question</p>
<p class="p1">now was, whether to remain standing there exposed to all the fury of the</p>
<p class="p1">storm, or to attempt the now dangerous descent into the glen.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“I could lead your horses down in safety, if you would let me, for I</p>
<p class="p1">know every inch of the road so well,” said the girl.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Another blinding glare of lightning, another terrific peal of thunder,</p>
<p class="p1">and another deluge of rain, put a stop to all reply. At last the child</p>
<p class="p1">repeated her offer, saying that she could lead the horses down very</p>
<p class="p1">well, “one at a time.” But, of course, that was not for a moment to be</p>
<p class="p1">thought of by the young men. And her plan was rejected at once.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Well, then, the only way will be to go down on foot, and leave your</p>
<p class="p1">horses here to follow. For you will need your hands as well as your feet</p>
<p class="p1">in groping down the slippery rock through the darkness,” said the girl.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">After a little more consultation, her last proposition was adopted, and</p>
<p class="p1">they began the descent on foot.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">After some twenty minutes’ toil and struggle through darkness and</p>
<p class="p1">deluge, thunder and lightning, they reached the lowly door of the cabin,</p>
<p class="p1">pushed it hastily open, and hurried in.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">It was very dark, and nothing was to be seen but the red glow of a few</p>
<p class="p1">smouldering embers on the hearth. Towards these the girl went.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“And what do you think has become of your flock of sheep, my good girl?”</p>
<p class="p1">inquired Frank, kindly, remembering her interests while he stood there</p>
<p class="p1">wringing the water out of his coat skirts.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Oh, the bell-wether has led them all into the pen long ago, sir. They</p>
<p class="p1">are always safe when they are once in the glen,” replied the child, as</p>
<p class="p1">she lighted a candle.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">The sudden glare of the light showed a rude apartment, with an earth</p>
<p class="p1">floor, log walls, and a fire-place of unhewn stone. On the right of the</p>
<p class="p1">fire-place stood a poor bedstead, upon which lay a venerable,</p>
<p class="p1">white-haired old man, covered with a faded counterpane, and near the bed</p>
<p class="p1">sat an old, chip-bottomed arm-chair. On the left of the fire-place were</p>
<p class="p1">two rough plank shelves, the lower shelf adorned with a few pewter</p>
<p class="p1">plates and mugs; the upper one filled with——books!—piles of old dingy,</p>
<p class="p1">musty books; and near these shelves stood a spinning-wheel, with a</p>
<p class="p1">broach of yarn on the spindle, and a basket of broaches under it. At the</p>
<p class="p1">opposite end of the room, one corner was occupied by a little old oak</p>
<p class="p1">table, and the other by a ladder leading up through a trap-door into the</p>
<p class="p1">loft overhead. A few rude stools were ranged along the walls, junks of</p>
<p class="p1">smoked venison, ropes of onions, bunches of dried herbs, hanks of yarn,</p>
<p class="p1">and the old man’s old hat and coat garnished the walls. All this was</p>
<p class="p1">seen at a glance.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Is your grandfather sick?” inquired Frank.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">The girl turned her eyes wistfully towards the venerable sleeper, and</p>
<p class="p1">did not reply.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Is your grandfather sick?” repeated Fairfax.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">The child raised her eyes sorrowfully to the face of the young man, and</p>
<p class="p1">remained silent.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Is he so _very_ sick?” earnestly reiterated Frank.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“He is not sick, sir,” answered the girl, in a low, sad voice.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“What is the matter with him, then?” thoughtlessly persisted Frank.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Without reply, the girl dropped her eyes, and blushing deeply, turned</p>
<p class="p1">away. Setting the candle down upon the table, she took a pail of water</p>
<p class="p1">and went up the ladder, and into the loft. After an absence of a few</p>
<p class="p1">minutes, she returned, and said—</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“If you will go up stairs now, you will find two suits of grandfather’s</p>
<p class="p1">and Carl’s Sunday clothes. They are not fine, but they are clean and</p>
<p class="p1">dry.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Our wet and jaded travellers thanked their young hostess, and prepared</p>
<p class="p1">to accept her offer.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“And if,” she added, “you would like to rest after so much fatigue,</p>
<p class="p1">there is a bed.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">They reached the loft, and found it a small, low place, with a little</p>
<p class="p1">window, and a little, clean bed. On the bed lay the two suits of</p>
<p class="p1">homespun, and two coarse towels. And on a stool near, sat a pail of</p>
<p class="p1">water and a tin basin.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“I do believe that little girl has given us her own sanctuary. What a</p>
<p class="p1">dear little thing she is!—so full of courage, and shyness, too! If she</p>
<p class="p1">were two or three years older, and a great deal prettier, I could fancy</p>
<p class="p1">myself writing poetry about her,” said Frank.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Clifton made no comment—he was engaged in divesting himself of his wet</p>
<p class="p1">garments, and thinking about—Miss Clifton.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">When they had refreshed themselves by washing and changing their dress,</p>
<p class="p1">Frank threw himself upon the bed, stretched out his limbs luxuriously,</p>
<p class="p1">and declared that the rustic’s clothes were very loose and comfortable,</p>
<p class="p1">and his own position truly delightful. Captain Clifton walked to the</p>
<p class="p1">window, and looked out at the storm, which was now abating.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Frank was already sound asleep.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">And while Clifton stood at the window, drawing comparisons between the</p>
<p class="p1">meanness of the hut in which he found himself, and the magnificence of</p>
<p class="p1">the mountain scenery around it, he heard—in that small, shell-like</p>
<p class="p1">cabin—he could not help hearing—what follows. First a heave and plunge,</p>
<p class="p1">as if the old man below stairs had started violently from his bed and</p>
<p class="p1">fallen again, and then a fearful, shuddering voice exclaimed, “Kate!</p>
<p class="p1">Kate! they’re coming again! They’re after me, Kate! They’re on me!</p>
<p class="p1">They’re on me! Save me, Kate! Save me, Kate! Save—”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Grandfather—dear grandfather,” said the soothing voice of the girl,</p>
<p class="p1">“there is no one here but me—there, there, be quiet—be still; nothing</p>
<p class="p1">shall hurt you here—nothing can you know.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Look! Look, Kate! Look! They’re not men now but devils!” A violent</p>
<p class="p1">plunge, struggles, exclamations of terror and despair which the low,</p>
<p class="p1">soothing tones and gestures of the poor girl vainly assayed to</p>
<p class="p1">tranquillize for some time, and then—silence for a few minutes—which was</p>
<p class="p1">again interrupted by—“Snakes! snakes, Kate! Snakes! _Green_ snakes! See!</p>
<p class="p1">see how they dart! They fly! They’re on me! They’re on me! Help! Help!”</p>
<p class="p1">And the sound of the maniac laying about him furiously. Captain Clifton</p>
<p class="p1">started up with the intention of going to the poor girl’s assistance—but</p>
<p class="p1">by the time he reached the head of the ladder, the voice of the child</p>
<p class="p1">had again calmed the infuriated man.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">All was quiet for a quarter of an hour, and then another violent start</p>
<p class="p1">and throw that seemed to shake the little hut, and a horrible shriek</p>
<p class="p1">of—“A dragon! A dragon. Kate! A green dragon belching flame!” Then a</p>
<p class="p1">succession of violent shrieks and struggles, which aroused Frank, who</p>
<p class="p1">springing up in bed, exclaimed—</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“What the deuce is the matter? Has the Major got another fit of</p>
<p class="p1">_mania-a-potu_ on him?” Then, as all again was quiet, he rubbed his eyes</p>
<p class="p1">and said, laughing, “I do believe I have been talking in my sleep! I</p>
<p class="p1">dreamed we were in our mess, and the Major was drunk again.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“A part of your dream was real. The old man below stairs has a fit of</p>
<p class="p1">_mania-a-potu_ upon him.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“What! and you staying here! I must go down and help the girl.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“You had better not as yet. She seems to have the power of soothing him.</p>
<p class="p1">Your presence might, by exasperating him, do more harm than good.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">At this moment another outbreak of fury from the madman caused Frank to</p>
<p class="p1">spring to his feet, and, exclaiming—</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“I can’t let that maniac tear my dear little hostess to pieces—” rush to</p>
<p class="p1">the head of the ladder.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“I tell you you had best not _intrude_—his mania seems perfectly</p>
<p class="p1">harmless to the child.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">But Frank was at the foot of the ladder, where, however, an impediment</p>
<p class="p1">met him. The girl, who had just succeeded in again soothing the madman,</p>
<p class="p1">came and stood before him, saying, “Pray do not come in, sir, just yet.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“But, my good girl, I must come in and remain to protect you,” gently</p>
<p class="p1">trying to pass her. She stood her ground firmly; her _lips_ said—</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“I am not in any danger. I beg you, sir, do not come in yet;” but her</p>
<p class="p1">steady and rather threatening _glance_ said—“Do not dare to look upon</p>
<p class="p1">the old man in his degradation!”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Frank turned back, and went and perched himself at the top of the ladder</p>
<p class="p1">to watch over the safety of the girl, and be ready in case of exigency.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">He saw the old man lying, clutching the cover around him, while his</p>
<p class="p1">terror-dilated eyes glared out like a wild beast’s from its lair—all</p>
<p class="p1">ready for another start and spring! He saw the girl mix a mug of strong</p>
<p class="p1">vinegar and water, and take it to him, and the old man grasp and quaff</p>
<p class="p1">it with fiery thirst; three times she filled the mug, and three times he</p>
<p class="p1">gulped its contents with voracity. Then she laid his aged head tenderly</p>
<p class="p1">down, and went and saturated a cloth with vinegar, and placed it about</p>
<p class="p1">his burning forehead and temples. Next she took a rustic fan of turkey</p>
<p class="p1">feathers and stood by him and fanned him until he fell into a sleep,</p>
<p class="p1">that every moment became deeper and deeper. Finally she gently laid down</p>
<p class="p1">the fan, sunk upon her knees by the bedside, and bowed her head upon her</p>
<p class="p1">clasped hands in silent prayer. At last she arose, pressed a light kiss</p>
<p class="p1">upon the furrowed brow of the sleeper, and silently went about her</p>
<p class="p1">household work.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">From a shed at the back of the house she brought wood and water, made up</p>
<p class="p1">the fire, filled and hung on the teakettle, set an oven and oven-lid to</p>
<p class="p1">heat, and again disappeared through the back door into the shed. In</p>
<p class="p1">about fifteen minutes she returned with a tray of dough and a pan of</p>
<p class="p1">venison steaks. She made her dough into a loaf and put it in the oven to</p>
<p class="p1">bake, and prepared her venison steaks to lay upon the coals. She set her</p>
<p class="p1">table with milk and cream, and butter, brought in, doubtless from a</p>
<p class="p1">rude, but cool spring-house, near at hand.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">When all was done, she sat down to knit, seeming to wait the coming of</p>
<p class="p1">another—for she often paused and listened with her head turned towards</p>
<p class="p1">the door, and at length got up and drew from under the bed a trunk,</p>
<p class="p1">whence she took an old, well-patched but clean suit of homespun clothes,</p>
<p class="p1">with a shirt and a pair of socks, and hung them over a chair.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Soon after a step was heard without—the door was thrown open, and a</p>
<p class="p1">thin, dark young man, dressed as a farm laborer, entered. Throwing his</p>
<p class="p1">coarse hat to the other end of the room, he approached the fire, when</p>
<p class="p1">seeing the situation of the old man he stopped short, and placing his</p>
<p class="p1">arms akimbo, gazed on him, exclaiming—</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Drunk again, by ——!” and then turned, with an interrogative look,</p>
<p class="p1">towards the girl.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">A short wave of the hand—a quick, distressful nod, and the choking down</p>
<p class="p1">of a sob, told him that it was so.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">The young man let down his arms, and with a frown of mingled sorrow and</p>
<p class="p1">anger approached and gazed upon the sleeper.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Have you had much trouble with him, dear Kate?”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">The same choking sob and quick nod answered him.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“_Where_ DID he get the liquor? What has he laid his hands on and sold</p>
<p class="p1">now—any of my books?”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“No! no!—it was my bonnet—but never mind, I can wear your old hat, you</p>
<p class="p1">know!—it doesn’t matter for me!”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Well, now, by all that’s—”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Hush, hush, Carl! Don’t swear—he is our grandfather, you know; and</p>
<p class="p1">besides,” she added, suddenly dropping her voice, “there are strangers</p>
<p class="p1">up stairs.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Strangers! What strangers?”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Two gentlemen who came in here out of the storm.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Umph!” said the young man, dropping himself into the arm-chair and</p>
<p class="p1">falling into deep thought, from which he was aroused by the voice of</p>
<p class="p1">Kate, saying—</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Carl, don’t sit down in your wet clothes; take those on the chair, and</p>
<p class="p1">go in the shed and put them on. And make haste, please, Carl, because</p>
<p class="p1">supper is nearly ready, and the gentlemen up stairs must be hungry.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">The young man arose, with a heavy sigh, saying—</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“I’ll only change my jacket, that I can do here. Oh! Kate!” he</p>
<p class="p1">continued, as he divested himself of his wet jacket, and drew on the</p>
<p class="p1">other—“Oh! Kate! what between one thing and another this is no home for</p>
<p class="p1">you! _Indeed, indeed_, every morning I go away from you with a heavy</p>
<p class="p1">heart, and all day long I can hardly work for the dread that’s on my</p>
<p class="p1">mind about you. If I could only find a place for you to wait on some</p>
<p class="p1">lady, or to nurse a baby—but, Lord! what with the niggers there is never</p>
<p class="p1">a place to be got here for a poor white girl.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Oh, Carl, if you could get me the best place in the world—even a place</p>
<p class="p1">to sew—I wouldn’t leave _him_. Why, Carl, it would break his heart. He</p>
<p class="p1">would grieve himself to death!”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“And better for him that he should be dead! And better for you and all</p>
<p class="p1">concerned!”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Oh, don’t say so, Carl! Don’t say so! Come and look at him, and let the</p>
<p class="p1">sight soften your heart to him,” said the girl, taking the youth’s hand,</p>
<p class="p1">and drawing him to the bedside. “Look, now, at that poor old wrinkled</p>
<p class="p1">face—it has not got very long to live, anyhow—and see the two or three</p>
<p class="p1">thin, white hairs on his temples—and see the poor, _poor_ withered</p>
<p class="p1">hands—so helpless! Oh! I think it is all so pitiful. And now see, he is</p>
<p class="p1">asleep, but how much trouble there is on his poor old face—no, no! don’t</p>
<p class="p1">say hard things of him, it cuts me to the heart! And, Carl, no matter</p>
<p class="p1">how bad his fit may be, he never offers to hurt me or anything else.</p>
<p class="p1">Only terror and horror is all that is on him! He is a gentle, harmless,</p>
<p class="p1">poor old man. And I always pity him like I pity any one very ill.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Kate! I dare say you think this is all tender-heartedness, and you give</p>
<p class="p1">yourself a great deal of credit for it! But I tell you it’s nothing but</p>
<p class="p1">weakness. And it may be the ruin of you, too, before long. And now I</p>
<p class="p1">tell you, I’m going to get a place for you, if I can. Yes, and make you</p>
<p class="p1">go to it, too. I can do without you—that is, I _must_ do without you! I</p>
<p class="p1">can get the breakfast before I go away in the morning. And I can leave</p>
<p class="p1">something for the old man’s dinner, and come home time enough in the</p>
<p class="p1">evening to get his supper! And to-morrow I am going down to the turnpike</p>
<p class="p1">gate to thrash Scroggings, and bring your bonnet home. And I’ll tell him</p>
<p class="p1">if ever he lets the old man have any more liquor, I’ll kick him round</p>
<p class="p1">his groggery till he hasn’t got a whole bone left in his body. Yes, and</p>
<p class="p1">I’ll do it, too!”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Kate was placing the supper on the table, but she turned, with the same</p>
<p class="p1">expression of countenance with which she had stopped Fairfax at the foot</p>
<p class="p1">of the stairs, and said—</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“I should be very sorry for any violence from you, Carl. But of one</p>
<p class="p1">thing be sure—do what you may, I will never, _never_ leave our</p>
<p class="p1">grandfather!”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“There! now, whenever you get that hateful Maria Theresa look, I _hate_</p>
<p class="p1">you, Katterin! I hate to see strength in women! It don’t belong to them,</p>
<p class="p1">nor grace them, anyhow!”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Strength of _affection_ does, Carl. But now please call the gentlemen</p>
<p class="p1">down to supper,” said Kate.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Carl rapped at the foot of the ladder, and summoned the travellers</p>
<p class="p1">accordingly.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Now, though Fairfax had honorably withdrawn from the trap-door, the</p>
<p class="p1">moment he found that his services would not be required, and that the</p>
<p class="p1">conversation between Kate and Carl was growing confidential, yet every</p>
<p class="p1">word of that conversation had been distinctly heard by both young men,</p>
<p class="p1">and had produced an effect upon both. Frank with difficulty withheld</p>
<p class="p1">himself from exclaiming aloud, as pity, disgust, anger or approbation</p>
<p class="p1">moved him in turn. Captain Clifton, far less impressible, and more</p>
<p class="p1">reserved than his companion, had remained perfectly quiet and silent,</p>
<p class="p1">though his thoughts were more practically busy with the case than those</p>
<p class="p1">of his companion. They went down, and were received at the foot of the</p>
<p class="p1">ladder by Carl, who, with a sort of rough politeness, placed stools at</p>
<p class="p1">the table, and invited them to be seated. They placed themselves at the</p>
<p class="p1">board, at the head of which Kate already presided, with folded hands and</p>
<p class="p1">downcast eyes. Then to their utter astonishment, the rude, irreverent</p>
<p class="p1">young man, Carl, stood up and asked a blessing, saying, afterwards, that</p>
<p class="p1">he was no parson, nor no Methodist, but Kate would have it so, and he</p>
<p class="p1">thought it was best upon the whole, not to oppose females in such</p>
<p class="p1">notions, And then he began to wait upon his guests.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Their supper consisted of good coffee, with cream and maple sugar; good</p>
<p class="p1">bread, with fresh butter and cheese; venison steak and broiled chickens;</p>
<p class="p1">and lastly, of a dish of baked pears, cold, and a pitcher of milk. Frank</p>
<p class="p1">was surprised to find such excellence of fare amid the ragged poverty of</p>
<p class="p1">the mountain cabin; but, on afterwards expressing this surprise to</p>
<p class="p1">Captain Clifton, he was told by the latter, that such contrasts were by</p>
<p class="p1">no means rare. Mr. Fairfax applied himself with zeal to the good things</p>
<p class="p1">before him, until the sharpness of his appetite was sated, and then</p>
<p class="p1">lingered long over the meal, conversing with his host upon the state of</p>
<p class="p1">the country in his region, the climate and soil, productions, market,</p>
<p class="p1">etc., and receiving from the young mountaineer the information that</p>
<p class="p1">there was no great amount of produce about there, except in the glens,</p>
<p class="p1">grazing for the cattle, and that the roads were so bad, and the towns</p>
<p class="p1">and villages so distant, that nothing was raised for market, except such</p>
<p class="p1">kind of produce as could walk thither, to wit: flocks and herds. That</p>
<p class="p1">his grandfather, before the infirmities of age had come upon him, had</p>
<p class="p1">raised herds of kine and hogs, which he drove fifty miles to market</p>
<p class="p1">every year; but that was some years ago, when he himself was a child.</p>
<p class="p1">That now they only had a few sheep, which his sister tended while he was</p>
<p class="p1">at work on a plantation at the foot of the mountain. In reply to a</p>
<p class="p1">question Frank put while leisurely using his gold tooth-pick, the young</p>
<p class="p1">man informed him farther that himself and his sister were of German and</p>
<p class="p1">Irish descent. That the old man, their grandfather, was a German by</p>
<p class="p1">birth, but had lived nearly seventy years in America. That his name was</p>
<p class="p1">Carl Wetzel, and his only daughter, Caterina, had been married to an</p>
<p class="p1">Irish emigrant, of the name of Kavanagh. That _they_ were the parents of</p>
<p class="p1">himself and sister. Finally, that they had been dead nearly seven years.</p>
<p class="p1">It was farther ascertained that old Carl Wetzel had been a man of</p>
<p class="p1">considerable education; and it was easily seen that Carl Kavanagh had</p>
<p class="p1">inherited much of his father’s Irish quickness of intelligence, and much</p>
<p class="p1">of his grandfather’s German love of knowledge.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Frank, on his part, was equally communicative, and, in spite of the</p>
<p class="p1">haughty reserve of Captain Clifton, informed his host that he had come</p>
<p class="p1">up in that neighborhood for the purpose of acting as groomsman at the</p>
<p class="p1">approaching marriage of his friend, Captain Clifton, of the —— Regiment</p>
<p class="p1">of Cavalry, to his cousin, Miss Carolyn Gower Clifton, of Clifton Place.</p>
<p class="p1">That their journey, so far, had been rather disastrous; that they had</p>
<p class="p1">set out from Washington City on horseback, but had become so fatigued by</p>
<p class="p1">the excessive heat, that they had been obliged, on arriving at</p>
<p class="p1">Winchester, to take places for themselves in the stage for Staunton, and</p>
<p class="p1">to hire a man to bring their horses after them—riding one and leading</p>
<p class="p1">the other, and so alternately. That before reaching Staunton, they had</p>
<p class="p1">been thrown from the stage—without serious injury to themselves,</p>
<p class="p1">however, and had been obliged to walk some ten miles to a village on</p>
<p class="p1">their route, and wait the arrival of their horses, which, fortunately,</p>
<p class="p1">were not many hours behind them. That they had ridden all day in a thick</p>
<p class="p1">fog, lost their way, came near going over a fearful precipice, and</p>
<p class="p1">finally got caught in the tempest that drove them for shelter to the</p>
<p class="p1">cabin.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">During all this time, Captain Clifton had seemed lost in thought, and</p>
<p class="p1">only once spoke to inquire of the young mountaineer whether it were</p>
<p class="p1">possible for them to pursue their journey that night. To this the young</p>
<p class="p1">man replied that it would be impossible, even if it were then daylight,</p>
<p class="p1">inasmuch as the torrents were swollen so greatly. And at the thought of</p>
<p class="p1">pursuing their journey, a pang of remorse for his forgetfulness of his</p>
<p class="p1">horses shot through the breast of Frank, and—</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“What the devil can have become of Saladin?” he exclaimed, starting up.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Oh, he is safe,” answered Clifton. “I saw them both in the shed as I</p>
<p class="p1">looked from the little window up stairs.’</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Who put them there?”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“I tended them,” answered the girl, quietly.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">They all now arose from the table. The girl cleared the board, and</p>
<p class="p1">carried all the things out to wash up. Carl begged his guests to excuse</p>
<p class="p1">him, and went out to give the horses a rub down and another feed.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Captain Clifton threw himself into the arm-chair, crossed his legs, took</p>
<p class="p1">out his tablets, and began to make memorandums.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Frank impertinently peeped over his shoulder and read—“Mem. Ask my</p>
<p class="p1">mother if she can take a little girl as a companion.” Clifton closed the</p>
<p class="p1">book instantly, in silent rebuke of Frank’s impudence. And Frank himself</p>
<p class="p1">walked about fidgety and unhappy for not knowing what to do with</p>
<p class="p1">himself, until, at a restless movement of the old man, he went and</p>
<p class="p1">poured out a mug of water, and carefully keeping behind the eye of the</p>
<p class="p1">patient, lifted up his head and gave him drink, and after setting down</p>
<p class="p1">the empty mug, fanned him till he went sound asleep again.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">The brother and sister soon returned. Carl sat down and begun his best</p>
<p class="p1">efforts at entertainment. But Frank, who amused himself by seeing</p>
<p class="p1">everything, saw Kate go up stairs into the loft and bring down and carry</p>
<p class="p1">out his own and his friend’s regimentals.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">After which she came in, and drawing a stool to the table, sat down and</p>
<p class="p1">began to knit, as quietly, as silently, as if no strangers were in her</p>
<p class="p1">hut.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Carl took down and laid upon the table a rough draught board, and</p>
<p class="p1">invited his guests to play with each other.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Frank eagerly caught at the opportunity, but Captain Clifton declined,</p>
<p class="p1">on the plea of distaste to the amusement.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Play with me, my dear fellow, for pity sake,” said Frank to Carl, “and</p>
<p class="p1">don’t mind my friend there! You see, he doesn’t want to play, neither</p>
<p class="p1">does he want to talk, nor to do anything but sit and think about Miss</p>
<p class="p1">Clifton.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Do play with him, and keep him quiet, if you can, my good youth,” said</p>
<p class="p1">Captain Clifton, turning his chair slightly aside from the table, so</p>
<p class="p1">that his face was in the shade. Opposite to him, at the other corner of</p>
<p class="p1">the table, sat Katherine, with the light shining full upon her face and</p>
<p class="p1">head, as she bowed it over her work. Captain Clifton did not fall into a</p>
<p class="p1">brown study, he fell into a study of the brown girl. Let no one presume</p>
<p class="p1">to misinterpret him. It was not likely that a man of twenty-five should</p>
<p class="p1">fall in love with a girl of fourteen. Dotards do such things, not men.</p>
<p class="p1">Then it was utterly preposterous to suppose that Archer Clifton, of</p>
<p class="p1">Clifton, Captain in the —— Regiment of Cavalry, the fastidious amateur</p>
<p class="p1">in female beauty, should be smitten with a hard-featured, sun-burned</p>
<p class="p1">girl, in a coarse, homespun frock, that the all-accomplished scholar</p>
<p class="p1">should be charmed with the little ignoramus; that the arrogant</p>
<p class="p1">conservative of rank should condescend to a low-born mountaineer; or</p>
<p class="p1">that the expectant bridegroom of the beautiful and haughty Carolyn</p>
<p class="p1">Clifton, of Clifton, should wish to marry a girl who united all these</p>
<p class="p1">repulsive qualities of ignorance, ruggedness, and low birth. Yet if he</p>
<p class="p1">could have looked only two short years into the future!</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">But Clifton was a physiognomist, and liked to study a novel</p>
<p class="p1">individuality. A new and very curious subject was before him now. At</p>
<p class="p1">first he had seen in Kate nothing more than a coarse-featured,</p>
<p class="p1">dark-skinned country girl. Now, as he sat and watched her at her quiet</p>
<p class="p1">work, with her countenance in the repose of thoughtfulness, he saw that</p>
<p class="p1">her features, though certainly not beautiful or classical, were even of</p>
<p class="p1">a higher order of physiognomy, combining the rarest elements of power</p>
<p class="p1">and goodness. The broad and massive forehead, straight nose, and square,</p>
<p class="p1">firm jaws, were the strong and ugly features—the rugged frame work, as</p>
<p class="p1">it were, of her countenance, and indicated great force of character. But</p>
<p class="p1">her hair, eyes, and lips were beautiful. Her hair, of rich dark brown,</p>
<p class="p1">with golden lights, rippled around her forehead, shading and softening</p>
<p class="p1">its stern strength. Her eyes, large and shadowy, with drooping lashes,</p>
<p class="p1">and her lips sweetly curved, full, and pensively closed, suggested a</p>
<p class="p1">profound depth of tenderness. Indeed the brooding brow, the downcast</p>
<p class="p1">eyes, and the compressed lips seemed to be habitual with her, and gave</p>
<p class="p1">her countenance an expression of grief and care beyond her years, and of</p>
<p class="p1">thought and intellect above her station. As Clifton sat and studied her,</p>
<p class="p1">he thought—not of</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">            </span>“Full many a flower that’s born to blush unseen,</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">            </span>And waste its sweetness on the desert air,”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">for the girl did not resemble a flower so much as a hardy, pine sapling</p>
<p class="p1">of her native mountains. No; that look, strength, intellect, and</p>
<p class="p1">self-balance—in a word—that look of POWER, suggested rather—_girl_ as</p>
<p class="p1">she was—</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">            </span>“Some village Hampden with undaunted breast.</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">              </span>*<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>*<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>*<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>*<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>*</p>

<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">            </span>Some CROMWELL guiltless of his country’s blood.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">It _was_ a Maria Theresa face without the wickedness.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Captain Clifton’s physiognomical studies were interrupted by the abrupt</p>
<p class="p1">starting of Frank, who exclaimed vehemently—</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Beaten in four games! Now, that’s what I call outrageous! Don’t you</p>
<p class="p1">know, my dear fellow, that there are three persons in the world who</p>
<p class="p1">should never be beaten—a guest, a woman, and a monarch?”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Carl laughed and chuckled, and beating the draught-board tambourine-like</p>
<p class="p1">above his head in triumph, carried it off and put it away.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">The whole party then arose to retire. Carl took the candle and showed</p>
<p class="p1">his guests up into the loft and left them to repose.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Now where will that child sleep, for we have got her room?” asked</p>
<p class="p1">Frank, with concern, as soon as they were alone.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Oh-h!” replied Captain Clifton, indifferently, “anywhere—on a</p>
<p class="p1">pallet—perhaps, down stairs.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“But the old man and the young one—”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Oh-h!” again drawled Clifton, in a bored tone, “if you expect to meet</p>
<p class="p1">with refinement among the mountain people, you will be disappointed.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Long after the travellers had laid down to rest, they heard the sound of</p>
<p class="p1">footsteps moving about in the room below. They moved quietly and</p>
<p class="p1">cautiously, as if fearful of disturbing the guests; but, as I said</p>
<p class="p1">before, all sounds, even the lowest, could be distinctly heard through</p>
<p class="p1">that shell of a house.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">On awaking the next morning, the young men found their own clothes well</p>
<p class="p1">cleaned, dried, and pressed, ready for them to put on.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Ah, ha!” said the sagacious Frank, “that is what the poor girl was at</p>
<p class="p1">work at so late last night.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">On going down stairs they found the lower room neatly arranged, and</p>
<p class="p1">breakfast ready for them—hot coffee, corn pone, hot rolls, rashers of</p>
<p class="p1">fried bacon, eggs, potatoes, etc. And there, in the arm-chair, in a</p>
<p class="p1">clean homespun suit, sat the old man, looking as calm, as</p>
<p class="p1">self-possessed, as noble and venerable as a Roman senator. He arose and</p>
<p class="p1">bowed to the gentlemen, and offered his chair to one of them.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">No wonder it bowed the young girl’s head with grief and shame—it pained</p>
<p class="p1">and humbled even these strangers, to know that this most reverend</p>
<p class="p1">white-haired patriarch was often transformed by drunkenness into the</p>
<p class="p1">beast! It was a disease, Kate had often said, wringing her hands with</p>
<p class="p1">anguish, while seeing his degradation.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">It _was_ a disease, and never till vice is treated as such, will an</p>
<p class="p1">effectual remedy be applied.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Immediately after breakfast, the gentlemen took leave of the family, and</p>
<p class="p1">mounted their horses to pursue their journey. Frank, in the thoughtless</p>
<p class="p1">kindness of his heart, would have offered the poor people some</p>
<p class="p1">remuneration for their entertainment, but Clifton, who knew the habits</p>
<p class="p1">and feelings of the mountaineers better, arrested a purpose that might</p>
<p class="p1">have given offence. But on parting with Carl Kavanagh, Captain Clifton</p>
<p class="p1">expressed his thanks for the hospitality that had been extended to</p>
<p class="p1">himself and friend—adding, that if he could then, or at any time, in any</p>
<p class="p1">manner, be of use to his kind host, he should be happy to serve him,</p>
<p class="p1">etc., etc. To this the young man replied—</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“I thank you, sir. I know Captain Clifton by report, and feel that I can</p>
<p class="p1">trust to his generosity. I have a heavy care—my young sister. If you</p>
<p class="p1">could hear of a place at service for her among the honorable ladies of</p>
<p class="p1">your family or acquaintance, I should feel very grateful indeed, sir.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Captain Clifton kindly gave his promise to make inquiries. Frank again</p>
<p class="p1">shook hands with Carl, bowed to Kate, nodded to the old man through the</p>
<p class="p1">window, and then the travellers turned from the door of the mountain</p>
<p class="p1">hut, cantered briskly up the glen, and took the road to WHITE CLIFFS.</p>

<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">The torrents had been so terribly swollen and overflowed, and the roads</p>
<p class="p1">so dreadfully washed and guttered by the tempest and flood of the</p>
<p class="p1">preceding evening, that the travellers found the greatest difficulty in</p>
<p class="p1">pursuing their journey, often having to turn back miles on this road to</p>
<p class="p1">take another way, and often being obliged to search leagues up and down</p>
<p class="p1">the course of a river, to find a practicable ford.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Therefore it was near night-fall when they crossed the last range of</p>
<p class="p1">forest-crowned mountains, and descended into the wooded valley that lay</p>
<p class="p1">between them and White Cliffs. A winding road through the woods brought</p>
<p class="p1">them to the house. The full moon was rising East of the cliffs, and</p>
<p class="p1">casting their shadow back across the house and lawn. The mansion was a</p>
<p class="p1">lofty edifice of white stone, with terraced roof, and many irregular,</p>
<p class="p1">projecting wings. The tall trees surrounding the buildings, the lofty</p>
<p class="p1">cliffs rising behind them, the dark shadow falling on all; the hour, the</p>
<p class="p1">silence, and the solitude, gave an air of refreshing coolness and deep</p>
<p class="p1">repose to the scene. On turning an angle of the building, they saw the</p>
<p class="p1">drawing-room windows open, and the light from them gleaming out</p>
<p class="p1">cheerfully across that part of the lawn. At that moment a servant,</p>
<p class="p1">waiting at the hall door, came down to take their horses.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“All well at home, Dandy?” inquired Captain Clifton, as he dismounted,</p>
<p class="p1">and threw him the reins.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Sarvint, sir. All very well,” replied the man, touching his hat.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Captain Clifton led the way up into the hall adjoining the drawing-room,</p>
<p class="p1">where they were met by an old gentleman, who seized both of Clifton’s</p>
<p class="p1">hands, and shook them slowly and cordially, as he said, dropping each</p>
<p class="p1">word separately, with a hearty, luscious emphasis—</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Why—my—dear—boy—how glad I am—to see you!”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“And I am very happy to be with you, sir; and to find you looking so</p>
<p class="p1">well. Allow me to introduce to your acquaintance—Lieutenant Fairfax, of</p>
<p class="p1">my company,” said Captain Clifton, presenting his friend.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Glad to see him! Glad to see Mr. Fairfax! Glad to welcome any friend of</p>
<p class="p1">my nephew’s to Clifton. How-do-you-do, sir? Knew your relative, Lord</p>
<p class="p1">Fairfax, of Greenway Courthouse. Excessively fond of hunting. Kept</p>
<p class="p1">bachelor’s hall. Very great mistake, that—very! Hope you won’t follow</p>
<p class="p1">his example! Fine man, however, and I honor his memory! Come in, sir!</p>
<p class="p1">come in! Come in, Archy! My—dear—boy—I’m—so—del—_ighted_ to see you!”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Whenever he spoke to his nephew, he seemed to dwell upon each separate</p>
<p class="p1">syllable with a cordiality impossible to describe.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">He was a large, old gentleman, clothed in a fresh, fragrant suit of pale</p>
<p class="p1">blue linen, with his hair as white as cotton, his fresh, rosy</p>
<p class="p1">complexion, fine teeth, and clear, kind, blue eyes, making a most</p>
<p class="p1">refreshing picture of simplicity, cheerfulness, and cleanliness of soul</p>
<p class="p1">and body in old age. He was of a sanguine temperament, and under great</p>
<p class="p1">provocation, could get into a passion, too. And what old father of a</p>
<p class="p1">family, with two grown daughters, and a young wife, all under eighteen</p>
<p class="p1">years of age, and all beauties, has _not_ enough combustible material to</p>
<p class="p1">burn the house down, or set his own temper on fire?—yet such was the</p>
<p class="p1">kindness of his heart, that even when in violent anger, stamping up and</p>
<p class="p1">down the floor, grasping desperately at his own white temple locks with</p>
<p class="p1">both hands, and vociferating in stentorian tones—it was all, as Frank</p>
<p class="p1">afterwards said, _shooting with blank cartridges_—he never said a word,</p>
<p class="p1">or did a thing, to wound a single soul.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“I trust the ladies are all well, sir,” said Captain Clifton, as he</p>
<p class="p1">followed his uncle.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Yes—yes—that is to say, _Carry_ is well, but not well _pleased_. She</p>
<p class="p1">expected you yesterday—didn’t consider the storm any excuse for your</p>
<p class="p1">absence. Ah! you dog—you sad dog—at your age would _I_ have kept a lady</p>
<p class="p1">waiting? Nay, would I do it _now_? But come, shall I present you to the</p>
<p class="p1">ladies now, or do you prefer first the refreshment of the bath and a</p>
<p class="p1">change of dress? Your own and your friend’s baggage arrived this morning</p>
<p class="p1">by the wagon, and has been conveyed to your rooms.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Oh, a change of dress, by all means!” suggested Frank.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Dandy—DANDY!” exclaimed the old gentleman, raising his strong voice,</p>
<p class="p1">till the servant appeared, “show Mr. Fairfax to General Washington’s</p>
<p class="p1">room.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">General Washington had slept one night at Clifton, and from that time to</p>
<p class="p1">this, the room he occupied has been “General Washington’s room.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">The servant conducted Mr. Fairfax up stairs. And then the old gentleman,</p>
<p class="p1">turning to his nephew, took his hands again, and said—</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“My dear boy, once more I must say, I’m—so—_glad_—to—see you! _You_ are</p>
<p class="p1">at home, you know. So go and find your room, and ring and give your</p>
<p class="p1">orders, _my son_, for you are so. And I will go and let the ladies know</p>
<p class="p1">that you have come, though I dare say they know it already.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">And shaking his hands, he let them go and turned slowly away.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Half an hour sufficed the young gentlemen to make themselves</p>
<p class="p1">presentable. At the end of which time they descended the stairs, and</p>
<p class="p1">were met in the hall by old Mr. Clifton, who ushered them into the</p>
<p class="p1">drawing-room.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">This apartment was a most delightful summer room. It was very spacious,</p>
<p class="p1">occupying the whole first floor of one of those irregular wings of the</p>
<p class="p1">house. The ceiling was lofty, the walls were covered with pearl white</p>
<p class="p1">paper, and the floor of white oak was waxed and polished to an ivory</p>
<p class="p1">smoothness. On three sides were tall windows, reaching to the floor, and</p>
<p class="p1">opening out upon the piazza or the lawn, and draped with snowy, flowing</p>
<p class="p1">curtains. On the fourth side was the open fire-place, whitened inside,</p>
<p class="p1">and having on its marble hearth an alabaster vase of lilies, whose</p>
<p class="p1">fragrance filled the air. The walls were adorned with tall mirrors, and</p>
<p class="p1">with choice paintings, all of a cool, refrigerating character, such as:</p>
<p class="p1">An Alpine Scene, A Green Forest Glade, with Deer Reposing, A Mountain</p>
<p class="p1">Lake, A Shaded Pond, with Cows, A Farm Yard in a Snow Storm, etc. A</p>
<p class="p1">piano stood at the farthest end of the room. A harp reclined near it. A</p>
<p class="p1">few marble-topped stands and tables, scattered over with rare prints,</p>
<p class="p1">books, _virtu_, _bijouterie_, etc., stood at convenient distances. A</p>
<p class="p1">lady’s elegant work-table, with its costly trifles, was a pleasing</p>
<p class="p1">feature in the room. Sofas, ottomans, divans, and lounging chairs,</p>
<p class="p1">“fitted to a wish for study or repose,” were everywhere at hand.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Through the open windows came the evening wind, laden with the fragrance</p>
<p class="p1">of flowers, the murmur of falling waters, the whisper of leaves, and the</p>
<p class="p1">cheery chirp of insects—those night songsters who begin when the birds</p>
<p class="p1">go to sleep—nature’s vesper choir. While _from_ the open windows could</p>
<p class="p1">be darkly seen the tall shadowy trees, the towering white cliffs, and,</p>
<p class="p1">in the distance, a bend of that great river which took its rise here,</p>
<p class="p1">and which there sleeping among the dark green hills, with the moon</p>
<p class="p1">shining full upon it, seemed a resplendent mountain lake, flashing back</p>
<p class="p1">the moonbeams from its bosom in rays of dazzling light. The whole effect</p>
<p class="p1">of the room and the scene was delightfully cooling and refreshing.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">When Mr. Clifton conducted his guests into this saloon, it was occupied</p>
<p class="p1">by three young ladies, who, immediately on their entrance, arose to</p>
<p class="p1">receive them; and whom, in presenting his visitors, Mr. Clifton</p>
<p class="p1">severally named as, my wife, Mrs. Clifton,—my daughter, Miss Clifton,</p>
<p class="p1">and my second daughter, Zuleime. Captain Clifton, in turn, saluted his</p>
<p class="p1">aunt and cousins. Miss Clifton, his betrothed, received him with cold</p>
<p class="p1">hauteur.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">So, these were the beauties—and beautiful, passing beautiful, they were</p>
<p class="p1">indeed, though differing from each other in beauty, as “one star differs</p>
<p class="p1">from another in glory.” But let me describe them.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Carolyn Clifton is tall and elegantly proportioned, and moves with</p>
<p class="p1">high-bred dignity. Her features are Grecian—her complexion is dazzlingly</p>
<p class="p1">fair, save when the pure rich blood mantles in her cheek, and crimsons</p>
<p class="p1">the short and scornful lip. Her eyes are blue, and half veiled by their</p>
<p class="p1">fair lashes, as in disdain of aught that might seek their glance. Her</p>
<p class="p1">fair hair is carried up from her forehead, and falls in bright</p>
<p class="p1">tendril-like curls around the back of her neck, lending an intellectual</p>
<p class="p1">and queenly grace to the proud head. The costume of that day closely</p>
<p class="p1">resembled the prevailing mode of our own. Miss Clifton wore a dress of</p>
<p class="p1">pale blue silk, made low in the neck, with a long-waisted stomacher,</p>
<p class="p1">tight sleeves reaching to the elbows, and ample flowing skirt. The neck</p>
<p class="p1">was trimmed with a fall of deep lace, then called a “tucker,” and</p>
<p class="p1">answering to the present _berthè_. The tight half-sleeves were trimmed</p>
<p class="p1">at the elbows by deep lace ruffles, shading the arm. A necklace of large</p>
<p class="p1">strung pearls around her throat, a bracelet of the same on her arm, and</p>
<p class="p1">a pearl-headed pin run through the Grecian knot of ringlets at the back</p>
<p class="p1">of her head, completed her toilet. She carried in her hand and toyed</p>
<p class="p1">carelessly with a beautiful fan of marabout feathers. She was the</p>
<p class="p1">daughter of the _first_ Mrs. Clifton, of Clifton, a fair, proud Maryland</p>
<p class="p1">lady, one of the haughty Gowers, who lived long enough to augment by</p>
<p class="p1">precept and example, the double portion of family arrogance Carolyn</p>
<p class="p1">Clifton had inherited from both sides of her house. Miss Clifton had</p>
<p class="p1">“received her education” at a first-class “Ladies’ Institute” at</p>
<p class="p1">Richmond.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Zuleime, the younger sister, was about fourteen years of age, but well</p>
<p class="p1">grown and full-formed for her years. She was the daughter of the second</p>
<p class="p1">Mrs. Clifton, a beautiful West Indian Creole, who died in giving her</p>
<p class="p1">life. She had the snowy skin and damask cheek of her father’s fair race,</p>
<p class="p1">and the glittering black hair and sparkling black eyes of her Creole</p>
<p class="p1">mother. Her dress was of plain white muslin, with short sleeves and low</p>
<p class="p1">neck, and coral necklace, which well set off the exceeding brilliancy of</p>
<p class="p1">her complexion. Zuleime was home for the mid-summer holidays.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Mrs. Clifton, of Clifton, Georgia!</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Yes, she is indeed the most beautiful woman in the whole world,”</p>
<p class="p1">exclaimed Fairfax, to himself, as he turned from the fair and dignified</p>
<p class="p1">Carolyn—the brilliant and sparkling Zuleime, to the dark and graceful</p>
<p class="p1">Georgia. She is of medium height. Her complexion is a rich, dark,</p>
<p class="p1">uniform olive, her very cheeks being of the same hue, but so</p>
<p class="p1">transparently clear, that that which would mar the perfection of another</p>
<p class="p1">face, adds deeper beauty to hers. Yes! the delicate bloom of the fair</p>
<p class="p1">Carolyn, and the bright damask blush of the brilliant Zuleime, seem</p>
<p class="p1">common-place beside the perfect beauty of the pure, clear olive cheek of</p>
<p class="p1">the dark Georgia. Her hair is intensely black, with depths under depths</p>
<p class="p1">of darkness, lurking in the labyrinths of irregular curls that cluster</p>
<p class="p1">around, and throw so deep a shadow over her witching face. Her eyebrows</p>
<p class="p1">are black and arched. Her eyelashes are long, black, and drooping. Her</p>
<p class="p1">eyes are—pause—I have been trying to think of something to which her</p>
<p class="p1">wondrous eyes may be compared, for darkness, profundity and power.</p>
<p class="p1">Midnight? No, her eyes are darker, stiller, and more solemn yet. Thunder</p>
<p class="p1">clouds? No, for her eyes are more stormy and impending still—and their</p>
<p class="p1">electric stroke is silent as it is fatal. In short, her eyes resemble</p>
<p class="p1">nothing but themselves. Her dress is of black gauze, over black silk,</p>
<p class="p1">made high to veil her neck, and finished with a narrow black lace,</p>
<p class="p1">within which gleams around her throat a necklace of jet and gold. She</p>
<p class="p1">wears no other jewelry. A large black lace mantilla is carelessly thrown</p>
<p class="p1">over all. When she moves her every movement is undulating grace—her</p>
<p class="p1">motion might be set to music. And when she sits still she is _so_ still,</p>
<p class="p1">and dark, and beautiful—_and something else, besides_, that the gazer</p>
<p class="p1">experiences something like the fascination and terror one feels in</p>
<p class="p1">looking down the depths of a dark chasm.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">She was the daughter of a portrait painter in Richmond, and this was</p>
<p class="p1">what Captain Archer Clifton, in his arrogance, called humble parentage.</p>
<p class="p1">Mr. Clifton had met her under the following circumstances: On finally</p>
<p class="p1">withdrawing his eldest daughter from school, he wished, before carrying</p>
<p class="p1">her home, to have her portrait taken, and went for that purpose to the</p>
<p class="p1">studio of Mr. Fuller, portrait and miniature painter, where he chanced</p>
<p class="p1">to see her for the first time, the artist’s beautiful child, Georgia. He</p>
<p class="p1">took so strong a fancy to this bewitching creature, that he delayed his</p>
<p class="p1">departure—prolonging his stay in the city for three weeks, at the end of</p>
<p class="p1">which, besides the accomplished Miss Clifton, with her elegant wardrobe,</p>
<p class="p1">splendid jewels, costly presents, and finished portrait—he took home the</p>
<p class="p1">artist’s daughter as the fourth Mrs. Clifton, of Clifton much to the</p>
<p class="p1">indignation of the haughty Carolyn, who never ceased to treat her</p>
<p class="p1">beautiful young stepmother with scorn and contempt.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Supper was announced, and the old gentleman, rising, requested his</p>
<p class="p1">nephew to lead in his wife, while he himself, took the arm of his eldest</p>
<p class="p1">daughter, and left Zuleime to Mr. Fairfax. They crossed the hall and</p>
<p class="p1">entered a large and pleasant dining-room, where stood an elegant table,</p>
<p class="p1">laid with a damask table-cloth, set out with silver plate, and Sevres</p>
<p class="p1">porcelain, and laden “with all the luxuries of the season.” Waiters of</p>
<p class="p1">perfect dress and _ad_dress were in attendance.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“I assure you, Miss Zuleime, that contrast is all the seasoning of</p>
<p class="p1">existence—and _this_ is a high seasoning. For yesterday we sat down to</p>
<p class="p1">eat supper off of pewter plates, on a bare board, in a mean hut, in</p>
<p class="p1">company with rude mountaineers, and to-night we sit at the elegant</p>
<p class="p1">tea-table of Clifton, surrounded with beautiful, refined, and</p>
<p class="p1">accomplished ladies,” said Frank, as he handed his lively companion into</p>
<p class="p1">her chair, and took the seat by her side.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">The sprightly Zuleime laughed, and said she doubted whether he would</p>
<p class="p1">find more substantial or savory fare here than he got at the mountain</p>
<p class="p1">hut.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">After all were seated, and all served, the conversation became general</p>
<p class="p1">and vivacious—old Mr. Clifton being evidently “the life of the company.”</p>
<p class="p1">He chatted, jested, laughed, told anecdotes, and finally, inspired</p>
<p class="p1">Frank, who gave a laughable description of their adventures on the</p>
<p class="p1">Alleghanies; of being upset in the stage coach, and pitched into Wolf’s</p>
<p class="p1">Lick; of being lost in the fog, and near going down the Devil’s</p>
<p class="p1">Staircase; finally, of being caught in the tempest, and shut up in a</p>
<p class="p1">mountain hut with a raving maniac. At this the old gentleman began to</p>
<p class="p1">rally his proud daughter on her gratuitous ill-humour of the preceding</p>
<p class="p1">evening, at the said delay, and then to scold the young men for their</p>
<p class="p1">effeminacy and want of gallantry, courage, in suffering themselves to be</p>
<p class="p1">deluged by the storm. Now, to be charged, all at once, with effeminacy,</p>
<p class="p1">and want of gallantry, and courage, even in jest, was too much, and in</p>
<p class="p1">Frank’s case, too near the truth to go without reply. So he began</p>
<p class="p1">vehemently to clear his fame, assuring the assembled company that it was</p>
<p class="p1">_not_ altogether effeminacy, for that they had been hospitably sheltered</p>
<p class="p1">in the cabin of a beautiful shepherdess.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Yes,” said Frank, maliciously, “_so_ beautiful that _Clifton_ there</p>
<p class="p1">couldn’t keep his eyes off her, and while I sat and played checkers with</p>
<p class="p1">her brother, he sat and studied her face, ‘and it were a book’—_for</p>
<p class="p1">hours_. I wish you had seen him, Miss Clifton—</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">                         </span>“‘Never gazed the moon</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">                   </span>Upon the water as he sat and read</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">                   </span>As ’twere her eyes.’</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Fact, my dear lady, and I should be guilty of misprision of treason, to</p>
<p class="p1">conceal it!” laughed Frank, shaking his head at his friend.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Ah-h-h! H-a-a-ah!—are you _there_, my fine fellow!” chuckled the old</p>
<p class="p1">gentleman, gleefully rubbing his hands, and pointing his finger at his</p>
<p class="p1">nephew, greatly enjoying his discomfiture.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“I assure you, sir,” began Captain Clifton, gravely.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Oh! don’t assure _me_! don’t assure _me_! Assure Carolyn! What d’ye</p>
<p class="p1">think o’ that, Carolyn? What d’ye think o’ that? More cause for</p>
<p class="p1">ill-humor last night, than ye thought, eh! What think o’ that?” he</p>
<p class="p1">continued, mercilessly.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">And Carolyn—</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">               </span>“Oh, what a deal of scorn looked beautiful</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">               </span>In the contempt and anger of her lip!”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">There are some women who cannot bear jest upon such subjects—who cannot</p>
<p class="p1">tolerate that their lovers should look with common curiosity—far less</p>
<p class="p1">gaze with interest or admiration “for hours,” upon any other young</p>
<p class="p1">female face. And such a woman was Carolyn Gower Clifton. Captain Clifton</p>
<p class="p1">knew this, and adoring her above all things, silently wished Frank and</p>
<p class="p1">the mountain-girl both at the bottom of the Devil’s Staircase.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">The old gentleman chatted and laughed; Frank jested and blundered; the</p>
<p class="p1">sprightly Zuleime sparkled and overflowed with fun and frolic, and the</p>
<p class="p1">meal went on merrily, notwithstanding.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">When supper was over they adjourned to the airy summer drawing-room,</p>
<p class="p1">where they distributed themselves according to their several humors.</p>
<p class="p1">Miss Clifton passed imperiously down the room, and took her seat upon a</p>
<p class="p1">distant divan. Captain Clifton followed, with a troubled air, and sat</p>
<p class="p1">down on the low ottoman at her feet. They doubtless thought if they</p>
<p class="p1">thought at all—that they were in a very obscure nook. But Frank had the</p>
<p class="p1">impertinence to see them. There sat the haughty and scornful girl, with</p>
<p class="p1">chin erect, lip curled, and eyelids cast down in disdain upon her</p>
<p class="p1">suppliant. And there sat Archer Clifton, with his high, proud face</p>
<p class="p1">turned up to hers, with an earnest, pleading, passionate gaze!</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Now, by the venom of Cupid’s shaft!” exclaimed Frank, to himself, “I</p>
<p class="p1">cannot see what Clifton finds to worship in that arrogant girl. If it</p>
<p class="p1">were this bright, warm Zuleime, here, now! But _her_! I might really</p>
<p class="p1">suspect _him_ of being a fortune-hunter, and _her_ of being an heiress,</p>
<p class="p1">if I didn’t know that Archer Clifton is himself the heir of the entailed</p>
<p class="p1">estate of Clifton, and that if his uncle were to die to-night, he might,</p>
<p class="p1">if he pleased, turn all these penniless women out of the house</p>
<p class="p1">to-morrow! Can’t understand it, for my life! But I suppose the bond of</p>
<p class="p1">sympathy between them is their name and their pride!”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Do you find talking to yourself a very amusing pastime, Mr. Fairfax,”</p>
<p class="p1">asked Zuleime, touching him on the elbow.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“No, my dear, delightful little girl, I don’t. What a delightful thing,</p>
<p class="p1">in a country house, is a beautiful girl of fourteen, home for the</p>
<p class="p1">holydays—a black-eyed, red-lipped girl, in a white muslin gown and a</p>
<p class="p1">coral necklace!”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Are your soliloquies as good natured as your conversation, Mr.</p>
<p class="p1">Fairfax,” inquired the laughing Zuleime.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Not quite, I’m afraid, my dear.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Do you know how to play chess, Mr. Fairfax?” she asked, opening the</p>
<p class="p1">chess-board.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“I know how to play _anything_ you wish me to play, my love—even the</p>
<p class="p1">fool!”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“_Oh!_ the latter is not so rare or difficult an accomplishment,”</p>
<p class="p1">laughed the maiden, taking her seat, and beginning to arrange the</p>
<p class="p1">chess-men. Frank sat down, and they commenced the game in earnest.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">All this time the old gentleman, with his white head and rosy face, and</p>
<p class="p1">kind smile and glance, had been walking leisurely up and down the floor</p>
<p class="p1">slowly, rubbing his hands with an air of great enjoyment—pausing now by</p>
<p class="p1">the work-table at which sat his beautiful wife, and gazing on her fondly</p>
<p class="p1">while he toyed with the elegant trifles of her work-box—then sauntering</p>
<p class="p1">off towards the chess-table, and patting the head of his “little</p>
<p class="p1">black-headed darling”—as he called Zuleime—or passing a jest with Frank</p>
<p class="p1">as he overlooked the game—until the boy came from the post-office</p>
<p class="p1">somewhat late; when taking the paper he went and ensconced himself in an</p>
<p class="p1">easy-chair on the opposite side of his wife’s work-table, and was soon</p>
<p class="p1">busied in the perusal of the debate on Mr. Jefferson’s bill for cutting</p>
<p class="p1">off entails. Frank felt very much pleased that the old boy, as he</p>
<p class="p1">mentally called him, was quieted at last, and that he himself had at</p>
<p class="p1">length an opportunity of initiating his charming companion into the</p>
<p class="p1">mysteries of flirtation, while she imparted to him the secrets of chess.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">The room was now very quiet. And Frank was soon deeply immersed in his</p>
<p class="p1">game. Yes—the room was very quiet, it seemed the sanctuary of domestic</p>
<p class="p1">love and happiness! At one extremity sat the betrothed lovers,</p>
<p class="p1">conversing in a low tone, softer than the hum of far-off bees. At the</p>
<p class="p1">other extremity sat the graceful young wife, placidly pursuing her quiet</p>
<p class="p1">work, and seeming more like the darling spoiled child of the old man,</p>
<p class="p1">her husband, who sat reading by her side, and whose kind eyes often</p>
<p class="p1">wandered from the paper and rested fondly upon her. About midway of the</p>
<p class="p1">room, sat Frank and his bright companion, too deeply interested in their</p>
<p class="p1">chess to notice the happy lovers, or to observe the quiet contentment of</p>
<p class="p1">the old man with his beautiful darling. Yes, this room seemed a temple</p>
<p class="p1">of domestic truth and trust—of family peace and joy. At least so thought</p>
<p class="p1">Frank, until raising his eyes from his game, his glance chanced to fall</p>
<p class="p1">for an instant upon the face of Mrs. Clifton.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">It might have been the darkness of her surroundings, which threw into</p>
<p class="p1">such strong relief that fearful countenance, for the black dress and</p>
<p class="p1">flowing black mantilla veiled all her form, while the clustering deep</p>
<p class="p1">black curls darkly shaded her face. Her form was turned from the table</p>
<p class="p1">and bent over the arm of the chair—her bosom was heaving, her lips apart</p>
<p class="p1">and humid, her nostrils slightly distended, and her eyes, those dreadful</p>
<p class="p1">eyes, fixed with a passionate, fierce, devouring gaze upon some distant</p>
<p class="p1">object.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Frank impulsively followed the direction of that consuming gaze, to</p>
<p class="p1">where the betrothed lovers sat fully reconciled. Clifton, unconscious of</p>
<p class="p1">all eyes, but those blue orbs that smiled so graciously upon him, was</p>
<p class="p1">pressing Carolyn’s hand to his lips in an ecstacy of love and gratitude.</p>
<p class="p1">Frank turned again to Mrs. Clifton. Her countenance had changed as by</p>
<p class="p1">the passage of a thunder-cloud. Her bosom was still as death. Her brow</p>
<p class="p1">and cheek was darkened, her teeth and lips clenched together, her eyes</p>
<p class="p1">fixed upon the lovers with the baleful glare of a demon. If the head of</p>
<p class="p1">the fabled Medusa had suddenly met his astonished gaze, he could not</p>
<p class="p1">have felt a deeper thrill of horror. And yet it was only a look—the look</p>
<p class="p1">of an instant—it came and went like the swift swooping past of a fiend’s</p>
<p class="p1">wing—but the shadow on all things seemed to remain. No more did that</p>
<p class="p1">room seem the blessed retreat of household faith and love—no! a deadly</p>
<p class="p1">serpent lay coiled among its flowers—a deadly poison lurked in its cup</p>
<p class="p1">of joy—the shadow of a demon’s wing was brooding in the air—the house</p>
<p class="p1">was CURSED!</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Frank was of a highly honorable nature, but nervous and impressible—he</p>
<p class="p1">could no longer confine his attention to the game; he misplayed</p>
<p class="p1">awkwardly—ridiculously. Zuleime laughed at him—and her silver laughter</p>
<p class="p1">struck almost unpleasantly upon his ear. He lost the game, and finally,</p>
<p class="p1">complimenting his young antagonist upon the excellence of her own</p>
<p class="p1">play—an excellence which he admitted he had not fully brought out—Frank</p>
<p class="p1">arose from the table and sauntered out into the piazza, exclaiming</p>
<p class="p1">inwardly—“Ugh! I believe in Satan, since I’ve seen that woman! Ugh!</p>
<p class="p1">Whe-ew! Every time I think of her I shall feel hot and smell brimstone!”</p>
<p class="p1">I said that Frank was of an extremely impressible nature. He stood now</p>
<p class="p1">upon the piazza at the back of the house, and the majestic crescent of</p>
<p class="p1">cliffs was before him. The quiet of the night, the freshness of the dew,</p>
<p class="p1">the coolness of the breeze, the beauty and sublimity of the mountains</p>
<p class="p1">rising from their girdle of forest, with their peaks bathed in</p>
<p class="p1">moonlight—the distant glimpse of the bend in the river, where it lay</p>
<p class="p1">like a silver lake among the hills—the divine peace and holiness of</p>
<p class="p1">nature fell soothingly, refreshingly upon his excited nerves. And after</p>
<p class="p1">sauntering up and down the piazza for some twenty minutes, he returned</p>
<p class="p1">to the parlor in a happier mood. There he found the family grouped</p>
<p class="p1">around the table on which sat a silver basket of pine-apples with</p>
<p class="p1">cut-glass plates, and silver fruit knives and napkins.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Come, Mr. Fairfax, my dear fellow, we are waiting for you,” said the</p>
<p class="p1">old gentleman, beckoning him.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Frank joined them at the table, and after this repast was over, the</p>
<p class="p1">family separated and retired to bed.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">                              </span>CHAPTER III.</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">                     </span>MRS. CLIFTON, OF HARDBARGAIN.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>She is a lady of confirmed honor, of an unmatchable spirit, and</p>

<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Clifton by the morning sunlight! Oh! that I could show it to you as</p>
<p class="p1">Fairfax saw it from the balcony of his chamber on the morning after his</p>
<p class="p1">arrival! The whole face of the country was very high, yet even this</p>
<p class="p1">elevated land was broken into hills and valleys, rocks and glens. Behind</p>
<p class="p1">the house arose the white cliffs so often mentioned, shutting out the</p>
<p class="p1">Northern view, but before the house lay the valley in which the</p>
<p class="p1">plantation was situated, and around that, East, West and South,</p>
<p class="p1">stretched a magnificent panorama, ridge beyond ridge of mountains,</p>
<p class="p1">covered with gigantic forests, clothed with the richest verdure, rolling</p>
<p class="p1">on until they gradually faded away in the distance, their forms lost</p>
<p class="p1">among the clouds of the horizon. It seemed a vast, boundless ocean of</p>
<p class="p1">greenery, of which the vales and mountains were the stupendous waves,</p>
<p class="p1">charmed to sleep.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">It was a magnificent solitude. Not a human dwelling to be seen. The</p>
<p class="p1">planters’ mansions—if there were any in the neighborhood, were low in</p>
<p class="p1">the vales, and hidden from sight. The mountain torrent, as it came</p>
<p class="p1">leaping down the side of the cliff, running through the wooded lawn,</p>
<p class="p1">losing itself in the forest vale, and reappearing as a mountain lake</p>
<p class="p1">among the distant hills, was a beautiful feature in the landscape. The</p>
<p class="p1">deep intense blue of the clear skies, the early splendor of the</p>
<p class="p1">sunlight, the murmur of the breeze among the waving trees, the joyous</p>
<p class="p1">songs of birds, gladdened all the scene, and put to flight Frank’s blue</p>
<p class="p1">devils, long before Dandy called him to breakfast.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">The breakfast-table was set in the lawn under the shadow of the pine</p>
<p class="p1">elms.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">The old gentleman, in his suit of cool white linen—the sisters in neat</p>
<p class="p1">morning dresses of white cambric, and the dark Georgia, in her usual</p>
<p class="p1">dress of black, were assembled on the piazza. They greeted Mr. Fairfax</p>
<p class="p1">with lively welcome, telling him that Clifton had not yet made his</p>
<p class="p1">appearance. But even while they spoke, Captain Clifton joined them, and</p>
<p class="p1">they sat down to breakfast. Those breakfasts on the lawn! How many times</p>
<p class="p1">in after years, in the sultry heat of the city hotel, did Fairfax recall</p>
<p class="p1">them!</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Soon after breakfast, Captain Clifton invited Mr. Fairfax to accompany</p>
<p class="p1">him in a ride up the ridge to his mother’s farm. And after taking leave</p>
<p class="p1">of the ladies they set out. They left the house by the back way, and</p>
<p class="p1">took a winding bridle-path up the side of the cliffs. The day was very</p>
<p class="p1">fine and cool, and their path was shaded by overhanging trees. It was</p>
<p class="p1">altogether a delightful ride, and as they went up, Clifton, who led the</p>
<p class="p1">way, turned his head around and inquired—</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Frank! what instigated you to romance so last night about our sojourn</p>
<p class="p1">at the mountain hut?”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Romance? I didn’t romance, except in saying that the girl was</p>
<p class="p1">beautiful. I said _that_ for your credit!”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Oh! I ought to be _exceedingly_ obliged to you!”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Yes—I think so, too—but what malicious Puck gave _you_ a love-weed, and</p>
<p class="p1">fooled you into sitting and studying that ugly little girl’s hard face</p>
<p class="p1">all the evening?”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“I did not think her ugly at all. She has a noble countenance. A _most_</p>
<p class="p1">noble countenance. One, of which an empress might be proud of!”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Ha, ha! Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha! _I_ saw nothing but a mountainous forehead,</p>
<p class="p1">and a strong portcullis jaw! ‘Noble!’ Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha! I said you’d</p>
<p class="p1">taken the love-powder!”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Yet even you cannot find any but a _noble_ simile in speaking of her</p>
<p class="p1">‘ugly’ features!”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Ah! what will Miss Clifton think of this admiration?”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Sir, Miss Clifton has my deepest homage, and when she is my wife, she</p>
<p class="p1">will indulge no follies. But, Fairfax, you are absurd, and I beg you</p>
<p class="p1">will abandon this ridiculous conversation. You know that I have always</p>
<p class="p1">had a proclivity to the study of character. Nature made me something of</p>
<p class="p1">a physiognomist. And if there be any truth in my favorite science, that</p>
<p class="p1">mountain-girl’s face presented the most extraordinary combination of</p>
<p class="p1">power and goodness I have ever met with.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Oh! then you only studied the maiden as the botanist would study a new</p>
<p class="p1">plant, the geologist a new fossil, or the naturalist a strange animal?—”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">—“Or the astronomer a new STAR? Precisely, sir! Except that the human</p>
<p class="p1">being is the highest and most absorbing study of all!”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Really! really! this passes belief—the proud, fastidious Archer</p>
<p class="p1">Clifton, to be smitten with an ugly mountain-girl!”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Frank! Nonsense—you really anger me. Listen, then, and I will tell you</p>
<p class="p1">why that child—for she is but a child—interested me so much. I saw in</p>
<p class="p1">her face the signs of wonderful force of character, as yet undeveloped,</p>
<p class="p1">and I saw in all her actions that which corroborated their testimony. I</p>
<p class="p1">was surprised to find all that in the humble mountaineer, and speculated</p>
<p class="p1">as to what, in her _very_ humble situation, it might lead. That was</p>
<p class="p1">simply all!”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“And did you not wish to be a providence to the mountain girl, and open</p>
<p class="p1">a field for so much energy?”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Perhaps such a thought might have presented itself to my mind. If so,</p>
<p class="p1">it was dismissed at once. A highly gifted _man_ of low birth must have</p>
<p class="p1">extraordinary talents indeed, and be placed in extraordinary</p>
<p class="p1">circumstances, to elevate himself above his condition—for a _girl_ in</p>
<p class="p1">such a case it is impossible. But, Fairfax, really this conversation has</p>
<p class="p1">taken a more serious tone than I designed it should. Really, nobility of</p>
<p class="p1">character, though very rare among the lower classes of society, is yet</p>
<p class="p1">not so impossible as to excite our wonder. There are others like Kate</p>
<p class="p1">Kavanagh—”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">—“How pat you’ve got her name! Now _I_ had forgotten it!”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Pooh! I say there are others like her. They are born great—they live</p>
<p class="p1">and die, and the world hears nothing of them. And talents that might</p>
<p class="p1">have swayed the counsels of a monarch, and decided the destinies of an</p>
<p class="p1">empire, have been employed to direct the household of a shepherd, and</p>
<p class="p1">determine the fate of a sheep! Such is the order of society, and better,</p>
<p class="p1">far better so, than that its boundaries should be thrown down, its ranks</p>
<p class="p1">intermingled!”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“There spoke a Clifton of Clifton!” said Frank.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">They were now at the top of the ridge, and entering upon a hard, stony,</p>
<p class="p1">half-reclaimed farm, in the midst of which stood a rude, but substantial</p>
<p class="p1">house, built of hewn rocks of every shade of gray, and surrounded by</p>
<p class="p1">trees. Below them, all around, rose the forest-crowned hills; behind</p>
<p class="p1">them the white cliffs concealed the mansion of Clifton from their sight,</p>
<p class="p1">all around them lay fields of stunted corn.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“This is Hardbargain,” said Captain Clifton, opening a rude farm gate,</p>
<p class="p1">and holding it open, while his companion passed through.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Hardbargain! a most appropriate name! I should think it the hardest of</p>
<p class="p1">all bargains, to receive this farm as a precious gift,” replied Frank,</p>
<p class="p1">looking around upon the stony field and stunted corn.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Yes,” admitted Captain Clifton, “it is a well-merited title. It was</p>
<p class="p1">once called Rocky Ridge. A poor man got a grant of it, and settled there</p>
<p class="p1">first—spent all his health and strength in trying to bring the rugged</p>
<p class="p1">soil under cultivation—failed—christened the place Hard_scrabble_, and</p>
<p class="p1">sold it to my grandfather for thrice its value. My grandfather repented</p>
<p class="p1">the purchase, re-christened the ill-starred farm Hard_bargain_, and, as</p>
<p class="p1">the Clifton estate was entailed upon his eldest son, gave this farm as a</p>
<p class="p1">portion to his younger son, my father. My father was then a subaltern</p>
<p class="p1">officer in the Continental Army, and absent with Washington, at Valley</p>
<p class="p1">Forge. My mother, with myself, then an infant, was a temporary sojourner</p>
<p class="p1">at Clifton. No sooner had my grandfather made a gift to my father of</p>
<p class="p1">this nearly barren farm, than my mother set all her faculties at work</p>
<p class="p1">for its cultivation and improvement. My mother was nearly penniless,</p>
<p class="p1">being the daughter of a family of decayed fortune. My father was unable</p>
<p class="p1">to send her anything except the Continental notes, with which he himself</p>
<p class="p1">was paid, but which would scarcely pass farther. But being determined</p>
<p class="p1">not to eat the bread of dependence by remaining at Clifton after my</p>
<p class="p1">grandfather’s death, my mother sold all her jewelry and plate, which had</p>
<p class="p1">been left her by a deceased maiden aunt, and applied the proceeds of the</p>
<p class="p1">sale to the improvement of Hardbargain. She hired laborers. There was a</p>
<p class="p1">rude log hut, built by the first settler upon the land. She hired a</p>
<p class="p1">woman, and placed her in that hut to keep house and cook for them. She</p>
<p class="p1">read books on agriculture, and consulted my uncle’s overseer upon the</p>
<p class="p1">same subject. And every morning she rode up and spent the day at</p>
<p class="p1">Hardbargain, overlooking the laborers. She was her own overseer! Frank!</p>
<p class="p1">you appreciate high worth when you see it. I may, besides, tell you</p>
<p class="p1">anything—you are my only companion—I tell you that my dear mother was</p>
<p class="p1">one in ten thousand. She was a true heroine, a heroine of domestic life.</p>
<p class="p1">Abandoning all her habits of elegance and refinement, despising luxury,</p>
<p class="p1">ease and comfort, disdaining the sneers of the world, and giving herself</p>
<p class="p1">to toil and hardship, and weariness of body and mind, that she might win</p>
<p class="p1">from the desert an independent home for her family! My dear mother had</p>
<p class="p1">no reason to suppose, and never admitted the possibility that my uncle</p>
<p class="p1">would not be blessed with a male heir, that _I_, her son, for whom she</p>
<p class="p1">toiled to secure a rugged farm, would be the inheritor of entailed</p>
<p class="p1">Clifton! And so she toiled, year after year, until at the end of the</p>
<p class="p1">war, when the army was reduced, and my father came home, he found a</p>
<p class="p1">comfortable house, and a productive farm.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Clifton seemed to have fallen into one of his fits of reminiscence;</p>
<p class="p1">scarcely conscious that he was talking to his true but volatile friend,</p>
<p class="p1">scarcely conscious that he was talking _at all_, he went on—</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“My first recollection of my dearest mother, is of a very noble looking</p>
<p class="p1">lady, of dark complexion, black hair, and gray eyes. I recollect, when</p>
<p class="p1">an infant of four years old, being brought out from the mansion-house of</p>
<p class="p1">Clifton every morning, to the back road gate, where she sat upon her</p>
<p class="p1">horse awaiting me, with a little basket, containing our dinner, hanging</p>
<p class="p1">on the horn of the saddle. I used to be lifted to the saddle before her,</p>
<p class="p1">and while her left arm encircled me, with her right hand she would guide</p>
<p class="p1">her horse around the base of the cliff, and take the winding bridle-path</p>
<p class="p1">that led up the Rocky Ridge, upon which lay her sterile farm of</p>
<p class="p1">Hardbargain. Oh! I remember how she used to ride from field to field,</p>
<p class="p1">making investigations, and giving directions to her rude workmen—and</p>
<p class="p1">with what deference the rough men were used to address her—hat in hand.</p>
<p class="p1">I remember, too, our cold dinners, taken under the shade of an elm tree,</p>
<p class="p1">whose lowest branches sheltered a fine spring—the head waters of that</p>
<p class="p1">very torrent, which, in course of time and space, swells into the mighty</p>
<p class="p1">river I told you of. Oh! my noble mother! how few would have displayed</p>
<p class="p1">her courage and fortitude!—not one in a million but would have rather</p>
<p class="p1">sat down in the luxurious ease and abundance of Clifton, where she had a</p>
<p class="p1">long welcome for as long as she should choose to stay—rather than have</p>
<p class="p1">dared the toil and hardship that she endured. The land was at last</p>
<p class="p1">cleared up, the farm laid off in order, and brought under the best</p>
<p class="p1">possible cultivation. A comfortable house was built, and my mother moved</p>
<p class="p1">into it to receive my father when he should come home, at the disbanding</p>
<p class="p1">of his company. He came at last—it was a happy time—and well I remember</p>
<p class="p1">how my mother’s young, but stern and weather-beaten face, bloomed and</p>
<p class="p1">softened again into youth and beauty and womanhood, by her soldier’s</p>
<p class="p1">side. But, ah! he had survived all the horrible perils and sufferings by</p>
<p class="p1">cold, hunger, and the foe, endured by our army during that long and</p>
<p class="p1">terrible struggle, and returned safe, to die in a time of peace—to die</p>
<p class="p1">at home, where every care and comfort surrounded him. Yes, he came home</p>
<p class="p1">in the winter of —82. Towards the spring, he took a slight cold—it was</p>
<p class="p1">neglected as of little account—it settled upon his lungs—before winter</p>
<p class="p1">came again, he died, and the first snow that fell, fell upon his grave.</p>
<p class="p1">My honored mother was a strong-minded woman. After what I have told you,</p>
<p class="p1">you know that she was! She loved him as only the strong can love. She</p>
<p class="p1">suffered as only the strong can suffer. She rose above that death-blow</p>
<p class="p1">to her happiness as only the strong can rise. But she has never been the</p>
<p class="p1">same woman since. When a few years had passed, and her son’s welfare</p>
<p class="p1">demanded her care, she aroused every faculty of her mind and body, for</p>
<p class="p1">the ‘purpose of insuring’ his greatest good. Even at that epoch of time,</p>
<p class="p1">there was no reason to suppose that I should inherit the Clifton estate.</p>
<p class="p1">My uncle was then in the prime of manhood, had married his second wife,</p>
<p class="p1">and by no means despaired of male issue. My dear mother taxed soul, body</p>
<p class="p1">and estate to the utmost, to defray my expenses at college, during the</p>
<p class="p1">seven years of my residence there. It was also to her persevering</p>
<p class="p1">exertions, as well as to the late military services of my deceased</p>
<p class="p1">father, that I owed my commission in the army. They say that</p>
<p class="p1">_misfortunes_ never come single. _Good fortune_ certainly ne’er does, if</p>
<p class="p1">I may judge of our own experience of both. When I had left college, the</p>
<p class="p1">heaviest tax was raised from our income, and when I obtained a</p>
<p class="p1">commission in the army, my year’s pay more than doubled the annual</p>
<p class="p1">income from the proceeds of the farm. At this time also my mother</p>
<p class="p1">received a legacy from an aged and distant relative, which enabled her</p>
<p class="p1">to stock her farm well, and furnish her house comfortably. Furthermore,</p>
<p class="p1">my uncle having lost his _third_ wife, and at last given up all thoughts</p>
<p class="p1">of a son of his own, began to take quite a paternal interest in</p>
<p class="p1">me—insisting, when off duty, I should spend all my time with him—and</p>
<p class="p1">finding neither myself nor my mother disposed to forego each other’s</p>
<p class="p1">society, would have persuaded the latter to take up her abode under his</p>
<p class="p1">roof. But that arrangement did not suit my mother. She, who in her young</p>
<p class="p1">womanhood had too high a spirit for dependence—preferring to give</p>
<p class="p1">herself to severest toil and privation, rather than live in easy luxury</p>
<p class="p1">under another’s roof—could not in her stern maturity be bribed to give</p>
<p class="p1">up her well-earned independence. Nor indeed, under any circumstances,</p>
<p class="p1">should I have consented to the plan. We compromised the matter by my</p>
<p class="p1">agreeing to spend half the time of furlough at Clifton. This was the</p>
<p class="p1">more congenial to my feelings, as my cousin Carolyn had now left school</p>
<p class="p1">permanently. As for my uncle, he consoled himself for his disappointment</p>
<p class="p1">in not getting my mother’s society at Clifton, by marrying a fourth</p>
<p class="p1">wife.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“I am impressed with the idea that your mother is a very proud woman,</p>
<p class="p1">Clifton!” said Frank, taking advantage of Captain Clifton’s first</p>
<p class="p1">thoughtful pause.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“No, no,” he answered, slowly, as in half reverie, “no—she is not what</p>
<p class="p1">the world calls proud—she is no conservator of rank, as I am. She is the</p>
<p class="p1">only _true_ republican I know in this whole Republic. Sprung, herself,</p>
<p class="p1">from an ancient, noble, and haughty race, she yet honors talent and</p>
<p class="p1">virtue, when met with in the lowest ranks, as much—nay, I verily</p>
<p class="p1">believe, _more_, than when found in the highest circles, where it is</p>
<p class="p1">natural they should be more frequently seen.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">——“But here we are, and you shall judge for yourself,” concluded Captain</p>
<p class="p1">Clifton, as he opened a gate admitting them into a shady yard, in the</p>
<p class="p1">midst of which stood the house. They alighted at the gate and gave their</p>
<p class="p1">horses into the charge of a negro boy, and walked on to the house. It</p>
<p class="p1">was a plain oblong stone building, of two stories, with a deep, shady</p>
<p class="p1">piazza, running the whole length of the front. It was divided through</p>
<p class="p1">the centre by a wide passage way, the front and back doors of which were</p>
<p class="p1">both open and drawing a fine draft of air, and from which opened four</p>
<p class="p1">large airy rooms, two on a side. They stepped up on the piazza, and were</p>
<p class="p1">met at the front door by a neatly clothed negro girl, who admitted them</p>
<p class="p1">into the passage, and opening a door on the right hand next the front,</p>
<p class="p1">showed them into a cool, breezy, but plainly furnished parlor; the walls</p>
<p class="p1">and ceiling being simply white-washed, and the floor bare but highly</p>
<p class="p1">polished with wax, as was the summer custom of the country at that day.</p>
<p class="p1">The fire-place was open and filled with green bushes. The</p>
<p class="p1">window-curtains, and the lounge, and easy-chair covers, were all of</p>
<p class="p1">chintz. There was a reality of substantial and permanent comfort about</p>
<p class="p1">the place, that Frank thought he had never seen elsewhere. And when</p>
<p class="p1">Clifton invited him to be seated, and he rested himself in one of those</p>
<p class="p1">cool arm-chairs in that shaded room, he declared that a feeling of</p>
<p class="p1">at-home-ativeness came over him, such as he had never experienced since</p>
<p class="p1">he left his own mother’s house, and never hoped to feel again until he</p>
<p class="p1">should have a house of his own. The negro girl whom Clifton addressed as</p>
<p class="p1">Hennie, then left the room to summon her mistress, and shortly after the</p>
<p class="p1">lady of the house entered.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Mrs. Clifton, of Hardbargain, was now about fifty years of age—tall, and</p>
<p class="p1">inclining to _en bon point_, but not more so than well became her years.</p>
<p class="p1">Her complexion was dark, and her hair and eyes black. Her features were</p>
<p class="p1">strongly marked and commanding, indicative of great strength of will and</p>
<p class="p1">indomitable firmness of purpose, all moderated, however, by the</p>
<p class="p1">expression of her countenance, which was at once composed and gracious.</p>
<p class="p1">Her manner was marked by unaffected dignity and courtesy—her dress was</p>
<p class="p1">of very plain dark silk, made high to the throat, and with sleeves</p>
<p class="p1">coming down to the wrists, a small ruff set closely around her neck,</p>
<p class="p1">fastened with a mourning pin. Her only head-dress was her own black</p>
<p class="p1">hair, which, though slightly mingled with gray, was worn uncovered.</p>
<p class="p1">Indeed, cap or turban upon that noble head would have looked</p>
<p class="p1">impertinent. She advanced into the room and greeted her son with</p>
<p class="p1">affection, and welcomed Mr. Fairfax with courtesy, though her words were</p>
<p class="p1">so few, and her manner was so calm, as to seem cool. Frank thought her a</p>
<p class="p1">very noble looking woman, though somewhat stiff and cold. Indeed, all</p>
<p class="p1">strangers, and superficial observers, thought her cold and proud. Never</p>
<p class="p1">was a greater misapprehension of character—never did a larger or more</p>
<p class="p1">generous heart live in the bosom of woman—albeit, its pulsations were of</p>
<p class="p1">the calmest and most regular character. She sat down and entered into an</p>
<p class="p1">easy conversation with her son and his friend, inquiring into the</p>
<p class="p1">particulars of their journey, and making comments as they were related.</p>
<p class="p1">Once during the recital her cheek almost imperceptibly changed. It was</p>
<p class="p1">at the telling of the hair-breadth escape at the brink of the Devil’s</p>
<p class="p1">Staircase, but upon that she made no observation whatever. She rang a</p>
<p class="p1">little hand bell, which was answered by the entrance of Hennie. She took</p>
<p class="p1">a bunch of keys from her pocket, and giving them to the girl, directed</p>
<p class="p1">her to bring refreshments. Hennie left the room, but soon returned</p>
<p class="p1">bearing a large waiter with home-made wine, cake, and a basket of fine</p>
<p class="p1">peaches and pears. While they regaled themselves upon these luxuries,</p>
<p class="p1">she inquired after the health and well-being of the family of White</p>
<p class="p1">Cliffs, and having received satisfactory answers, turned to Mr. Fairfax</p>
<p class="p1">and hoped that he was sufficiently well pleased with their neighborhood</p>
<p class="p1">to favor it with a long sojourn. Frank assured her that he should never</p>
<p class="p1">grow weary of the delights of his visit, and should conclude it only</p>
<p class="p1">when compelled to do so, and _then_ with great regret. The conversation</p>
<p class="p1">then became of more general interest. The weather, the condition of the</p>
<p class="p1">roads, the health of the neighborhood, &amp;c., were discussed. And then the</p>
<p class="p1">discourse took a higher tone, and the agricultural and political</p>
<p class="p1">condition and prospects of the whole country, and the great probability</p>
<p class="p1">of another speedy war with Great Britain, were debated. And Mr. Fairfax</p>
<p class="p1">wondered at the extent of information, the strong grasp of mind, and the</p>
<p class="p1">depth and justness of thought, displayed by this recluse lady upon</p>
<p class="p1">subjects apparently so foreign to her daily experience.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">They made quite a long morning visit, and before their departure,</p>
<p class="p1">Captain Clifton took an opportunity—while Mr. Fairfax was walking around</p>
<p class="p1">the room and staring at some old family pictures, among which hung a</p>
<p class="p1">portrait by ——, of Oliver Cromwell, as Lord Protector of England—to draw</p>
<p class="p1">his mother aside, and say to her—</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Madam, I have a proposition to make to you, or a favor to ask—as it may</p>
<p class="p1">turn out.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“What is it, my son?” gravely inquired the lady.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“You heard Mr. Fairfax speak of the young mountain-girl whom we met just</p>
<p class="p1">before the storm, and who kindly conducted us to her grandfather’s</p>
<p class="p1">cabin?”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Yes.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“It is of her that I would speak, and for her that I would enlist your</p>
<p class="p1">sympathy and protection—”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Go on, I attend, my son.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“You have given me some credit for insight into character. If my</p>
<p class="p1">judgment is worthy of your consideration, this young girl is deserving</p>
<p class="p1">of your kindest offices.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Does she deserve them?”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Madam, she impressed me as being a child of high moral and mental</p>
<p class="p1">endowments, and the trying experience of one night proved the truth of</p>
<p class="p1">that impression.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Does she need my good offices?”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Mother! with the finest intellectual capacities, she is nearly</p>
<p class="p1">destitute of all opportunities of intellectual culture. That is bad—but</p>
<p class="p1">not so deplorable as what follows. Kate Kavanagh—that is her name—is far</p>
<p class="p1">removed from all of her own sex. Her young brother, her only protector,</p>
<p class="p1">is absent from home from earliest dawn till late at night. Her only</p>
<p class="p1">companion is an old man, an habitual drunkard, subject to frequent and</p>
<p class="p1">furious fits of _mania-a-potu_. Her case, upon my showing, may not be so</p>
<p class="p1">exigent. But if you had seen her as I did, it would seem so. Her brother</p>
<p class="p1">being best acquainted with the circumstances, is the best judge in the</p>
<p class="p1">premises, and is very anxious upon his sister’s account, and wishes to</p>
<p class="p1">get her a place at service.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“But if she is a girl of so excellent a nature as you have supposed,</p>
<p class="p1">will she leave her aged relative?”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Not willingly, certainly—but—I wish the opportunity of improving her</p>
<p class="p1">condition afforded her, indeed, I promised her brother Carl that it</p>
<p class="p1">should be presented.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“I know Carl Kavanagh—he worked for me during the last year. I formed a</p>
<p class="p1">good opinion of him. If his sister is equal to him she must be a</p>
<p class="p1">meritorious girl.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“She is very superior to him, madam.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">The lady was mistress of great promptitude and decision of action. With</p>
<p class="p1">her eyes fixed upon the ground she reflected for a few moments, then</p>
<p class="p1">lifting them, said—</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Write to your friend Carl Kavanagh—”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Not my _friend_, dear madam, an’ it please you!” haughtily interrupted</p>
<p class="p1">her son.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">A slight shade of disapproval or of displeasure clouded the lady’s brow</p>
<p class="p1">for a moment, and she said—</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Write then to your dependent, Carl Kavanagh, and let him know that I am</p>
<p class="p1">willing to receive his sister into my own service on trial—and that he</p>
<p class="p1">may bring her hither as soon as is convenient.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Thank you, dearest madam, I will write to-day, and send a messenger</p>
<p class="p1">with the letter. I am really pleased and grateful for this kindness,”</p>
<p class="p1">said Archer Clifton, pressing his lips to the cheek she offered to his</p>
<p class="p1">salute.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">The young men soon after took leave, being engaged to dine that day at</p>
<p class="p1">home at White Cliffs.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Clifton!” said Mr. Fairfax, as they rode along, “excuse me for telling</p>
<p class="p1">you freely how highly I honor your mother. Yes! you may stare! _I_—the</p>
<p class="p1">irreverent—the rash said—_excuse_ me for telling you how highly I honor</p>
<p class="p1">your mother—for, by my faith, she is a lady whom to praise is</p>
<p class="p1">presumption! But, my dear Clifton, how is it that she resembles so</p>
<p class="p1">closely that old portrait of Oliver Cromwell, which hangs, besides,</p>
<p class="p1">between two family portraits. It is not possible you claim descent from</p>
<p class="p1">_him_?”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“My mother does, by the female line. I do not think I have much of his</p>
<p class="p1">nature. In his time I should have been a royalist. My mother venerates</p>
<p class="p1">his character very highly.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“By my soul! she is like him enough in feature.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Yes, and in many points of character, she is strikingly like him.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">In conversation such as this the friends reached White Cliffs, and Mr.</p>
<p class="p1">Fairfax retired to his chamber to dress for dinner, and Captain Clifton</p>
<p class="p1">entered the library for the purpose of writing a letter to Carl</p>
<p class="p1">Kavanagh.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">       </span>Which, taken at the flood, leads—” God knows where.—BYRON.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Captain Clifton had written to Carl Kavanagh, informing him of the</p>
<p class="p1">situation he had procured for the sister of the latter, at Hardbargain.</p>
<p class="p1">And within this letter he had inclosed a longer one, to Kate, filled</p>
<p class="p1">with good counsels and urgent reasons why she should yield to the wishes</p>
<p class="p1">of her brother, and accept the place offered to her. After having</p>
<p class="p1">dispatched these letters by a boy, who left White Cliffs that afternoon,</p>
<p class="p1">on horseback, he delivered himself up to the delights of Miss Clifton’s</p>
<p class="p1">society, forgetting all about the mountain-girl, until the next day,</p>
<p class="p1">when, being seated in the library, his messenger returned, entered his</p>
<p class="p1">presence, and handed him a packet. It was a letter from Carl Kavanagh,</p>
<p class="p1">enclosing one from Kate. He read Carl’s epistle first. It began by</p>
<p class="p1">expressing much gratitude to his benefactor, for his kindness in having</p>
<p class="p1">procured a situation for his sister, and went on by expressing much</p>
<p class="p1">sorrow that he could not prevail upon Kate, either by entreaties or</p>
<p class="p1">threats, to accept it, and unbounded indignation at what he called the</p>
<p class="p1">girl’s wicked stubbornness. The letter closed by reiterating the thanks</p>
<p class="p1">of the writer. Captain Clifton held the letter open in his hand, and</p>
<p class="p1">lifting his head, fell into deep thought. It was strange how much this</p>
<p class="p1">little matter depressed him. Account for it, any philosopher that can.</p>
<p class="p1">Some proud people have a proclivity to patronage—Captain Clifton was</p>
<p class="p1">very proud, and perhaps he was piqued at being prevented playing the</p>
<p class="p1">patron. Perhaps it was really disappointed benevolence. Only it is</p>
<p class="p1">certain that Archer Clifton did not possess that quality to an</p>
<p class="p1">immoderate degree—and having once done his duty of charity, would be</p>
<p class="p1">likely to content himself with any result. Perchance he felt a deeper</p>
<p class="p1">interest in the rugged little mountaineer than he would have</p>
<p class="p1">acknowledged, even to himself. Perhaps it was prescience—the shadow of</p>
<p class="p1">coming events. Be that as it may, Archer Clifton walked up and down the</p>
<p class="p1">floor in silent thought, occasionally broken by a slight sigh. It was</p>
<p class="p1">wonderful how much the knowledge that he should not have this child at</p>
<p class="p1">home in his mother’s house vexed his soul.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">At length he recollected Kate’s own letter, yet unopened. But of what</p>
<p class="p1">avail to read it! It would certainly be the counterpart of Carl’s. He</p>
<p class="p1">opened it. It was not, however. In the first place, the paper was</p>
<p class="p1">perfectly clean; and in the second, the writing, spelling, and style,</p>
<p class="p1">were rather better. She acknowledged the goodness of Captain Clifton, in</p>
<p class="p1">taking thought of her humble wants—expressed regret that she could not</p>
<p class="p1">avail herself of his kindness—could not leave her grandfather, who</p>
<p class="p1">needed her services, and subscribed herself Captain Clifton’s obliged</p>
<p class="p1">and grateful servant. It _was_ very much like Carl’s, after all. But</p>
<p class="p1">here is a postscript. What more can she have to say, after what she has</p>
<p class="p1">said, thought Clifton, as he turned to it. It read thus—</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“P. S.—I hope Captain Clifton will pardon me, if he thinks that I am</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>doing wrong—but it has come into my head, that as Captain Clifton is</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>about to marry, and reside in future at White Cliffs—and as Mrs.</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Clifton of Hardbargain, will then be quite alone—and as she is not so</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>young, or active, or able to ride about her plantation, overseeing her</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>field hands as formerly—perhaps she will be thinking of getting a</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>farm-manager—if so, will Captain Clifton kindly remember my brother</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Carl, and speak a favorable word for him to the lady of Hardbargain,</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>who already knows and trusts him? If Carl gets a situation as</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>overseer, I can keep house for him, and we can both take care of our</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>grandfather. Indeed I am afraid Captain Clifton will be justly angry</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>with me for this liberty.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“What a letter!” exclaimed Archer Clifton, as his face alternately</p>
<p class="p1">lighted up with satisfaction, or became clouded with thought. “What a</p>
<p class="p1">letter for a rustic girl of fourteen! Yet characteristic of _her_ and of</p>
<p class="p1">her situation. Showing the germs of reflection, forethought, courage and</p>
<p class="p1">promptitude, the gifts of nature, mingled with that frankness bordering</p>
<p class="p1">upon presumption, which belongs to total ignorance of the world. To dare</p>
<p class="p1">to speak familiarly of our domestic affairs! But yet how naïvely she</p>
<p class="p1">deprecates my displeasure, at what she feels may be received as</p>
<p class="p1">presumption.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">So deeply did Captain Clifton study Kate and her letter; Kate’s</p>
<p class="p1">remarkable countenance, with its breadth of brow and gentleness of eyes,</p>
<p class="p1">haunted him.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">He was a man of prompt decision and action—so, having once admitted the</p>
<p class="p1">idea that his mother needed an overseer, he exclaimed—</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Yes, my mother must be relieved from her arduous occupation—unbefitting</p>
<p class="p1">a lady of her rank, and especially of her age. Why could I not think of</p>
<p class="p1">that before? Why should I never have seen the necessity, until Catherine</p>
<p class="p1">held it up before me? Yes—my mother must have a manager on her farm, and</p>
<p class="p1">Carl Kavanagh shall be the man. I will pay his salary myself.” And he</p>
<p class="p1">rung the bell, ordered his horse, and in less than fifteen minutes was</p>
<p class="p1">on his way to Hardbargain.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">As he rode up to the house, he met a girl with a pail on her head, going</p>
<p class="p1">to the spring, and inquired of her where her mistress was to be found.</p>
<p class="p1">He was told, “down in the wheat field.” So, turning his horse’s head a</p>
<p class="p1">little to the left of the house, he rode down the slope of the hill, to</p>
<p class="p1">a wide harvest field, where he found Mrs. Clifton, seated on her mule,</p>
<p class="p1">superintending the operations of some fifteen or twenty laborers, who</p>
<p class="p1">were employed in stacking wheat. He rode up to his mother’s side,</p>
<p class="p1">alighted, and held out his hand, saying—</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“How-do-you-do, to-day, madam? Busily engaged as ever, I see, mother.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“How-do-you-do, Archer? Yes, very busy.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">While Captain Clifton was revolving in his mind the best way of</p>
<p class="p1">introducing the object of his visit, which he had reason to believe</p>
<p class="p1">would be distasteful to the energetic, independent lady—she quite</p>
<p class="p1">unconsciously anticipated his intention, and relieved him from his</p>
<p class="p1">embarrassment, by saying—</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“The heat is extremely oppressive, and I begin to find this business too</p>
<p class="p1">much for me, Archer. This continuing out in the fields day after day,</p>
<p class="p1">and all day long, throughout this burning weather, begins to tell, even</p>
<p class="p1">upon my constitution.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Archer Clifton looked at his mother and noticed for the first time a</p>
<p class="p1">slight but certain change in her countenance, invisible, perhaps, to an</p>
<p class="p1">indifferent glance, but seeming to the eye of affection, fearfully like</p>
<p class="p1">the very earliest premonitory symptoms of decay. That look pierced him</p>
<p class="p1">to the heart. The fainter sound of her voice, too, had vaguely suggested</p>
<p class="p1">failing strength—it fell upon his ear like a prophecy, a warning, a</p>
<p class="p1">knell. He realized then, for the first time, that his mother was</p>
<p class="p1">mortal—was growing old—that some day he should lose her. He felt then,</p>
<p class="p1">for the first time, how much _he_—a man—had rested on this good</p>
<p class="p1">mother—and his heart was troubled within him. And yet it was all caused</p>
<p class="p1">only by a transient weariness in the look of her face, and a faintness</p>
<p class="p1">in the tone of her voice. But more than all things else on earth—more</p>
<p class="p1">_deeply_—though less ardently—than his own fair expectant bride—did</p>
<p class="p1">Archer Clifton love his mother! It had even been said, some years</p>
<p class="p1">before, by one who knew him best, that Clifton could never love any</p>
<p class="p1">woman with the full force of his nature unless in qualities of mind and</p>
<p class="p1">heart she resembled his mother. But of course, Captain Clifton had</p>
<p class="p1">disproved that prophecy by adoring his cousin, the haughty and beautiful</p>
<p class="p1">Miss Clifton. This is a digression—to return—</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">As the new pang of fear for his mother’s health sped through his heart,</p>
<p class="p1">Archer Clifton took her hand—he had a singularly sweet and persuasive</p>
<p class="p1">voice and manner, when moved by his affections, and said—</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“There is no necessity for it, dear mother. Surely, the motive that</p>
<p class="p1">prompted you when I was a lad, and when this farm was our only prospect,</p>
<p class="p1">has long ceased to operate.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“I know it, Archer. For some years past this personal superintendence of</p>
<p class="p1">the fields has been more a matter of habit, than a matter of necessity.</p>
<p class="p1">If I could find a good manager I might try one.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“What do you think of Carl Kavanagh in that capacity, mother?”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Carl! I never thought of him at all. He has never managed a</p>
<p class="p1">plantation.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“But yet he has been a farm laborer many years—has a practical knowledge</p>
<p class="p1">of agriculture, and is, besides, a man of more intelligence than is</p>
<p class="p1">usually to be found in his class.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Yes—he is,” said the lady, thoughtfully.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“He is also a man of excellent moral character, and faultless</p>
<p class="p1">habits—qualities not too frequently met with among those of his grade.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“True—most true—but yet he is young, and has had no experience in</p>
<p class="p1">overseeing.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“And never will have, dear madam, unless some one gives him the</p>
<p class="p1">opportunity of making the trial. And as for his youth, mother—why his</p>
<p class="p1">youth is positively an advantage—for with his practical knowledge,</p>
<p class="p1">intelligence and honesty, he will be free from the conceit and crotchets</p>
<p class="p1">of an old manager, and will the more readily fall into your system.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“There is something in that,” said the lady. “And now, Archer, you will</p>
<p class="p1">remain and dine with me to-day. And remember, that when this week is</p>
<p class="p1">out, the next week belongs to me. You must bring your friend with you</p>
<p class="p1">when you come. Where did you leave him?”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Playing battledore with Zuleime. But, dear mother, about this Carl</p>
<p class="p1">Kavanagh—I hope you will consider the plan favorably, and try him.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“I will think of it, Archer, because you propose it, if for no other</p>
<p class="p1">reason. And now the horn is blowing for the hands to go to dinner, and</p>
<p class="p1">my task for the day is relieved. Let us return to the house.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">They turned their animals’ heads, and rode up the ascent, and entered</p>
<p class="p1">the shady yard. Then the lady alighted from her mule, gathered up her</p>
<p class="p1">riding skirt, and leaning on the arm of her son, entered the house. A</p>
<p class="p1">plain but substantial dinner was soon served. Archer Clifton enjoyed his</p>
<p class="p1">mother’s plain meals more than the most luxurious dinners—not but that</p>
<p class="p1">he had a taste for luxury—what man has not?—but that there was a home</p>
<p class="p1">comfort about his mother’s table, that gave him appetite and spirit. And</p>
<p class="p1">then, after dinner, he could go and stretch himself upon the best lounge</p>
<p class="p1">in that large, shady, breezy parlor, with a book, and read or doze until</p>
<p class="p1">she had attended to the putting away of her things, and had locked up</p>
<p class="p1">her pantries. Then she would come and sit in the rocking-chair by his</p>
<p class="p1">side, while he could stretch himself at ease, in any ungainly attitude</p>
<p class="p1">he pleased, and feel what a refreshing thing it was to throw off his</p>
<p class="p1">dignity in the presence of the only one with whom he could do so—his own</p>
<p class="p1">familiar mother. Not but that he honored—nay, _revered_ her—but that he</p>
<p class="p1">enjoyed only in her house, that deep, full sense of home freedom, which</p>
<p class="p1">not only her son—but to a certain degree all others felt, who possessed</p>
<p class="p1">the privilege of the lady’s friendship.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">This afternoon, then, he was lying at his ease on the cool lounge</p>
<p class="p1">between the two front windows, which were drawing strong drafts of air,</p>
<p class="p1">and flapping the festooned curtains lazily. He had thrown himself out at</p>
<p class="p1">full length upon the lounge, in the most delightfully _degagè_ attitude,</p>
<p class="p1">albeit it was somewhat angular and awkward—his head being thrown back</p>
<p class="p1">over the end of the lounge, his hands clasped above his forehead, and</p>
<p class="p1">his elbows very prominent, one foot, minus a slipper, hoisted upon the</p>
<p class="p1">window-sill, and the other slippered foot dangling on the carpet. But</p>
<p class="p1">the picturesque beauty of his dark, handsome face, atoned for all the</p>
<p class="p1">rest. His mother sat in an easy-chair near him, with her feet upon a</p>
<p class="p1">footstool, and a work-stand by her side. She was engaged in stitching</p>
<p class="p1">wristbands—for that vigorous woman never required a lounge in the</p>
<p class="p1">day-time—but though she never took one, yet she never blamed the</p>
<p class="p1">indulgence of that habit in others for which she herself felt no</p>
<p class="p1">inclination. She was the most liberal and benevolent of all human</p>
<p class="p1">beings, in every act of her daily life. She was happy in seeing others</p>
<p class="p1">comfortable around her. She was ever pleased to see them enjoying those</p>
<p class="p1">relaxations which her own strong nature did not need. Indeed, courage</p>
<p class="p1">without asperity, fortitude without indurancy, strength without</p>
<p class="p1">hardness, self-denial without sternness, power without arrogance, formed</p>
<p class="p1">the peculiar excellence of her character. No wonder that her son revered</p>
<p class="p1">her. No wonder it had been said of him, that he never could love a woman</p>
<p class="p1">with all the power of his nature, unless in mental and moral</p>
<p class="p1">endowments—she resembled his mother. As they talked together this</p>
<p class="p1">afternoon, the hours slipped away till late in the evening, before the</p>
<p class="p1">image of the beautiful Carolyn had power to draw him from the _tête à</p>
<p class="p1">tête_. During the afternoon he had prevailed with his mother to receive</p>
<p class="p1">Carl Kavanagh as her overseer—and to have the comfortable log cabin</p>
<p class="p1">which had been occupied by the first proprietor of the soil, prepared</p>
<p class="p1">for the reception of the family.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">When Archer Clifton at length arose to take his leave, he pressed his</p>
<p class="p1">mother to his heart with so much fondness and power, that the quiet,</p>
<p class="p1">calm lady laughed, a little, low, jolly laugh, and jested about</p>
<p class="p1">Carolyn’s jealousy—even of his mother.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">                  </span>* <span class="Apple-converted-space">      </span>* <span class="Apple-converted-space">      </span>* <span class="Apple-converted-space">      </span>* <span class="Apple-converted-space">      </span>*</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Captain Clifton returned to White Cliffs, and gave himself up for the</p>
<p class="p1">rest of the evening, to the charms of Carolyn’s conversation.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">The next day was one of festivity. Mrs. Clifton, of Hardbargain, came</p>
<p class="p1">over to dine at White Cliffs, and to meet a large party of the</p>
<p class="p1">neighboring gentry. The day after that, the whole party dined and spent</p>
<p class="p1">the evening at Hardbargain—and this was the commencement of a series of</p>
<p class="p1">neighborhood entertainments in honor of the approaching marriage, which</p>
<p class="p1">were kept up for several weeks. The wedding was to come off in the</p>
<p class="p1">course of a month—the present delay being owing to this circumstance:</p>
<p class="p1">old Mr. Clifton had sent to England, by the good ship Rockbridge,</p>
<p class="p1">Captain Cater, an extensive order, including a splendid outfit for the</p>
<p class="p1">bride; and they were now awaiting to hear of the arrival of the</p>
<p class="p1">Rockbridge at Norfolk. In all the excitement of social enjoyment,</p>
<p class="p1">Captain Clifton had found time to ride to the mountain hut, and arrange</p>
<p class="p1">with Carl Kavanagh to come and take the situation of overseer at</p>
<p class="p1">Hardbargain. He agreed to pay the latter a liberal salary, and to</p>
<p class="p1">provide a comfortable house for his family. One thing surprised and</p>
<p class="p1">annoyed him. Kate, who had written so freely, frankly, almost</p>
<p class="p1">presumptuously to him—received him with the old cold shyness and</p>
<p class="p1">reserve—not even expressing the least gratitude for the kindness he had</p>
<p class="p1">shown in getting the situation for her brother, or the trouble he had</p>
<p class="p1">condescended to take in coming personally to inform them of it. He</p>
<p class="p1">agreed with Carl, that the latter, with his grandfather and sister,</p>
<p class="p1">should remove to Hardbargain in the course of the week—and on his own</p>
<p class="p1">part he promised to have the log-house prepared for their reception. He</p>
<p class="p1">shook hands with the old man and Carl on parting, but when he offered</p>
<p class="p1">the same civility to Kate, she turned pale and trembled, and when he</p>
<p class="p1">took her hand he found it cold.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“I do not think you are well, my dear girl—your mountain air does not</p>
<p class="p1">engender chills, does it?” he asked, pressing the cold fingers.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">She raised her eyes one brief instant to his, and dropped them quickly</p>
<p class="p1">again, while her pale check and brow became suffused with crimson, and</p>
<p class="p1">her hand that he held in his own throbbed like a heart.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“When we get you to the plantation you will be better, my dear girl,”</p>
<p class="p1">said Clifton, kindly, shaking her hand and letting it go.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Captain Clifton rode away full of thought—speculating more upon</p>
<p class="p1">Catherine’s reserve than became a gentleman of his station and</p>
<p class="p1">importance. What was it to him that a rustic girl was too shy to express</p>
<p class="p1">in person, her thanks for a favor received, even though she had “screwed</p>
<p class="p1">her courage to the sticking place” to write to him and solicit it? Many</p>
<p class="p1">people, more conversant with the world than Catherine, can write that</p>
<p class="p1">which they never can bring their lips to say. Besides it was no</p>
<p class="p1">matter—what was that lowly maiden to him, the heir of Clifton, and the</p>
<p class="p1">prospective husband of the highest and haughtiest lady in the land?</p>
<p class="p1">Yes—what to him except an object of his high patronage could be that</p>
<p class="p1">girl of—not only “humble parentage,” but indubitably _low birth_? He</p>
<p class="p1">rode on dissatisfied, he knew not wherefore, with her and himself.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">As for Catherine, she stood—lost—where he had left her—lost to the</p>
<p class="p1">consciousness of her grandfather’s and of Carl’s presence—with her eyes</p>
<p class="p1">fixed upon the ground, blaming herself for her awkwardness and seeming</p>
<p class="p1">ingratitude; wondering if _he_ blamed her too; wondering why it was that</p>
<p class="p1">when she saw him enter she grew cold and trembled so; and when he spoke</p>
<p class="p1">to her in that gentle tone, and looked at her with that gentle gaze—her</p>
<p class="p1">whole nature shrank away in fear and trepidation—and though she would</p>
<p class="p1">have given the world for the ability to express her gratitude and</p>
<p class="p1">regard, all power of uttering a grateful word or of lifting a grateful</p>
<p class="p1">glance to his face, deserted, and left her pale and trembling before the</p>
<p class="p1">man whom she had no cause to fear, and every reason to trust. Catherine</p>
<p class="p1">stood with her mind deep in this problem, until the harsh voice of Carl</p>
<p class="p1">startled her, saying, in rasping tones—</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Well! are you going to stand there burrowing your eyes in the ground</p>
<p class="p1">all day? A pretty way you have behaved! Please goodness, you’ve got no</p>
<p class="p1">more manners than a dumb brute. I take my oath I am ashamed of you! Now</p>
<p class="p1">there was Captain Clifton, a gentleman of so high rank, condescending to</p>
<p class="p1">come here and tell us himself of the place he had got for us, even after</p>
<p class="p1">your unmannerly refusal of that first place—and here were you with not</p>
<p class="p1">one _word_ of thanks to give—no! please Heaven, not so much as one civil</p>
<p class="p1">_look_! I wonder what he’ll think of you?”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“What, indeed?” repeated Catherine, very meekly.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">But Carl scarcely recognized her voice. It was no longer the childish</p>
<p class="p1">treble—it was the deep, full, melodious voice of rich womanhood.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Why, the _kindest_ thought he can have of you, will be to think you are</p>
<p class="p1">a _fool_—that is all.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Carl, I was in fear of him.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“In fear of him! In fear of Archer Clifton! A man whom all the country</p>
<p class="p1">knows to be of the highest honor—and one to whom even _I_, cautious as</p>
<p class="p1">_I_ am, could trust you with, to go from one end of the world to the</p>
<p class="p1">other!”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“I know that, Carl—I know he is a gentleman of honor, but—but—I tremble</p>
<p class="p1">before him, and have not courage to lift my eyes—”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“But that is so confoundedly ridiculous, now! _why_ are you afraid of</p>
<p class="p1">him?”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Kate shook her head and waved her hand in that quick, short manner which</p>
<p class="p1">was peculiar to her, and turned away—repeating in her own heart the</p>
<p class="p1">question—“Yes, why, _why_, WHY?”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Whether the maiden found an answer to her question or not, remained a</p>
<p class="p1">secret to Carl; this was the first and last conversation they ever held</p>
<p class="p1">on the subject; and whatever phenomena the opening heart of the maiden</p>
<p class="p1">revealed to herself, were carefully shrouded away from the eyes of all.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">                  </span>* <span class="Apple-converted-space">      </span>* <span class="Apple-converted-space">      </span>* <span class="Apple-converted-space">      </span>* <span class="Apple-converted-space">      </span>*</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">How beautiful was Carolyn Clifton! So fair, so purely, so divinely fair,</p>
<p class="p1">so radiant, so refined, so stately! How fit a consort for the proud</p>
<p class="p1">Archer Clifton! How his heart swelled with admiration and pride as he</p>
<p class="p1">gazed upon her queenly form—and how it glowed to think that in a very</p>
<p class="p1">few days that fair and stately lady, who never deigned to own a passion,</p>
<p class="p1">whose love he only guessed by her proud exaction of exclusive service,</p>
<p class="p1">who scarcely condescended to extend her snowy hand to his salute—would</p>
<p class="p1">be his own, his own, his wife, his property, his other self—whose form</p>
<p class="p1">he might press to his bosom in the fullest freedom of possession! And as</p>
<p class="p1">he sat by her side and held her hand, and gazed upon her inaccessible,</p>
<p class="p1">delightful beauty; oh! how slowly, slowly, to his impatient, burning,</p>
<p class="p1">throbbing heart—how slowly, dragged the days and hours.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Well—oh very well would it have been for Archer Clifton, could he have</p>
<p class="p1">rent his gaze from his magnetic idol a moment, and caught a certain pair</p>
<p class="p1">of evil eyes upon him. Their baleful glare might have shed upon his path</p>
<p class="p1">some light to the pitfalls in his way.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>

<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Carl Kavanagh and his sister were settled in the log cabin on the farm</p>
<p class="p1">of Hardbargain. Carl, as an old acquaintance of the mistress, and a late</p>
<p class="p1">laborer on the plantation, fell readily into his new business of</p>
<p class="p1">overseeing it. Catherine began to busy herself in the management of her</p>
<p class="p1">new and very comfortable home. Their cabin contained a sitting-room,</p>
<p class="p1">kitchen, and two chambers. Mrs. Clifton had gratified her own kindly and</p>
<p class="p1">benevolent disposition by adding several plain articles of furniture to</p>
<p class="p1">the small stock possessed by the poor family. She had, besides, given</p>
<p class="p1">Catherine a set of half-worn, white dimity curtains, and a pair of</p>
<p class="p1">coarse, home-made, white counterpanes. These gave an air of neatness,</p>
<p class="p1">approaching—I had almost said refinement to the sitting-room, and two</p>
<p class="p1">little bed-rooms. Mrs. Clifton, of Hardbargain, was not addicted to</p>
<p class="p1">taking sudden likings—indeed, though a lady of perfect frankness,</p>
<p class="p1">benevolence and liberality of judgment, she was cool and prudent—yet,</p>
<p class="p1">notwithstanding this her kindest affections were at once attracted</p>
<p class="p1">towards Kate. It is true she had been prepared to think well of the</p>
<p class="p1">child from an intimate knowledge of her brother Carl’s honesty and</p>
<p class="p1">intelligence, but at the first sight of Catherine, the noble countenance</p>
<p class="p1">of the mountain-girl riveted her esteem. There are some faces which we</p>
<p class="p1">know at a glance cannot belong to other than a fine, high-toned</p>
<p class="p1">character. And such a countenance was that of Catherine. And it won upon</p>
<p class="p1">the lady every day, as no merely beautiful face could ever have done.</p>
<p class="p1">For hers was a brow—</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>“Where every god did seem to set his seal to give the world assurance</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">    </span>of—”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">a peerless woman. Often Mrs. Clifton invited Catherine to bring her work</p>
<p class="p1">and sit with her through the afternoon, and seldom did she let the girl</p>
<p class="p1">return without placing in her hand some book just suitable to her very</p>
<p class="p1">age, and the stage of progress of her mind. And oh! did not the heart of</p>
<p class="p1">the maiden kindle and glow with love and admiration for the noble lady,</p>
<p class="p1">who, without one particle of pride, or the least pretension to</p>
<p class="p1">condescension—condescended so much. And so Catherine grew to understand</p>
<p class="p1">and appreciate Mrs. Clifton, and to look upon her with a feeling</p>
<p class="p1">amounting almost to worship. How happy were those afternoons spent with</p>
<p class="p1">her in the cool and breezy parlor. How deeply grateful was Kate for all</p>
<p class="p1">her benefits—how anxious to prove her gratitude—to do something for her</p>
<p class="p1">benefactress. But Kate was very shy, and her love only spoke in the</p>
<p class="p1">stealthy look of affection fixed upon the lady, and withdrawn with a</p>
<p class="p1">deeply blushing cheek if discovered. But by these tokens sure did Mrs.</p>
<p class="p1">Clifton know the sweetness and the tenderness, the modesty and the</p>
<p class="p1">sincerity of the maiden’s hidden heart. And all this time was Catherine</p>
<p class="p1">wishing for the ability to tell her friend how much she thanked and</p>
<p class="p1">loved her. One afternoon she mustered up the courage to tell the lady</p>
<p class="p1">that she should like to read to her any time that it would be agreeable;</p>
<p class="p1">also, that she had some skill in doing up laces and such things and that</p>
<p class="p1">she should be happy if she could assist Mrs. Clifton in such matters.</p>
<p class="p1">Mrs. Clifton placed her hand affectionately on Catherine’s head, and</p>
<p class="p1">declined all her offers of service except that which related to the</p>
<p class="p1">reading—which she accepted—hoping thereby to improve her protégé in many</p>
<p class="p1">ways—to direct her choice of books, to correct her elocution, and to</p>
<p class="p1">awaken her understanding of what she read by questions and comments. So</p>
<p class="p1">they began a course of historical reading with Rollin’s Ancient History.</p>
<p class="p1">And that which this excellent lady commenced as a duty of kindness soon</p>
<p class="p1">became a matter of daily recreation. It was indeed a rare intellectual</p>
<p class="p1">pleasure to arouse, cultivate and hold communion with a fresh, vigorous,</p>
<p class="p1">original enthusiastic mind like that of Catherine. And those afternoons</p>
<p class="p1">were almost as happy for the lady as for her protégé—happier for</p>
<p class="p1">Catherine they could not have been. Once, the shy girl was entirely</p>
<p class="p1">carried out of herself and her reverie by the following circumstance:</p>
<p class="p1">The lady had inadvertently let fall that she was a descendant of Oliver</p>
<p class="p1">Cromwell, when Kate, hurried beyond her consciousness, clasped her hand</p>
<p class="p1">and gazed fervently up in her face, exclaiming—</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Descended from Oliver Cromwell! Descended from Oliver Cromwell, that</p>
<p class="p1">friend of man? that friend of freedom? Oh! it is no wonder, lady, that</p>
<p class="p1">you are so noble, so superior to all the world!”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“My Catherine,” said the lady, calmly withdrawing her hand “You know too</p>
<p class="p1">little—far too little of the world, to judge how I stand in comparison</p>
<p class="p1">to others. And what know you of Oliver Cromwell? Our reading has</p>
<p class="p1">scarcely reached the invasion of Britain by the Romans.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Oh, lady! lady! lady!” said Kate, warmly, being not yet recovered from</p>
<p class="p1">her trance—“lady—Carl and I had not many books, so we read what we had</p>
<p class="p1">over and over again! And one of the books we read the most was the life</p>
<p class="p1">of Oliver Cromwell!”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“You are generally so shy, Catherine, that it is a blind work in me to</p>
<p class="p1">direct your studies, not knowing what you have read and what you have</p>
<p class="p1">not.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Yes—very delightful to both were these seasons, and very strong was the</p>
<p class="p1">affection beginning to cement between the lady and the maiden. There was</p>
<p class="p1">only one thing that disturbed Catherine in the perfect enjoyment of</p>
<p class="p1">these afternoons. When Archer Clifton would surprise them by suddenly</p>
<p class="p1">entering the room, and throwing himself into an arm-chair or upon a</p>
<p class="p1">sofa, her heart would stand still, and her whole frame tremble with an</p>
<p class="p1">agitation as impossible to comprehend as to conquer. And yet much as his</p>
<p class="p1">arrival disturbed her, his departure failed to make her happy. On the</p>
<p class="p1">contrary, it left a strange sadness and yearning she could not shake</p>
<p class="p1">off. But then these things were of rare occurrence. Captain Clifton very</p>
<p class="p1">seldom found time to visit his mother—he was contented to know that she</p>
<p class="p1">had a companion;—and as for Kate, he never thought of her at all—she was</p>
<p class="p1">provided for and forgotten. Body, soul, and spirit were taken</p>
<p class="p1">up—absorbed in the contemplation of his promised bride, and in the</p>
<p class="p1">anticipation of her possession. Catherine knew he was soon to be</p>
<p class="p1">married, but what of that? She was a child, with no knowledge at her</p>
<p class="p1">tender years to understand her own heart, and no skill to define its</p>
<p class="p1">first developments.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">At White Cliffs “all went merry as a marriage bell.” The “Rockbridge”</p>
<p class="p1">was at length telegraphed at Norfolk. A letter with an invoice was</p>
<p class="p1">received by Mr. Clifton, who immediately dispatched a special messenger</p>
<p class="p1">to receive his valuable portion of the cargo. The wedding-day was fixed</p>
<p class="p1">for that day week, and great preparations were on foot. The gentry of</p>
<p class="p1">the neighboring counties were invited. The mansion-house was “swept and</p>
<p class="p1">garnished” from garret to cellar. Frank and Zuleime were daily</p>
<p class="p1">rehearsing their parts as bridesmaid and groomsman, which Frank declared</p>
<p class="p1">to be only an apprenticeship to the business of enacting bride and</p>
<p class="p1">groom. Some city guests from Richmond had arrived by particular</p>
<p class="p1">invitation, four or five days before the expected wedding. Last of all</p>
<p class="p1">came the wagon with the boxes from Norfolk. They were opened in the</p>
<p class="p1">hall—such treasure of splendid attire, and such sets of jewelry! And,</p>
<p class="p1">above all, such a trousseau for the bride—conspicuous in which was the</p>
<p class="p1">bridal dress and veil—the bridal dress and train of richest white</p>
<p class="p1">brocade heavily embroidered with silver, after the gorgeous fashion of</p>
<p class="p1">that time—the bridal veil of finest lace—the orange flower wreath of</p>
<p class="p1">pearls and emeralds—the pearl embroidered gloves and slippers—the pearl</p>
<p class="p1">and silver mounted fan, and all complete in correspondence. And richer</p>
<p class="p1">still was a ball-dress of blue silver-embroidered brocade, with its</p>
<p class="p1">elegant coiffure of ostrich feathers, the sight of which Zuleime</p>
<p class="p1">declared was enough to precipitate _any_ girl into matrimony.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Every one was too happy, too busy and too self-important to notice the</p>
<p class="p1">deathly hue of Georgia’s cheek, far less to detect the fitful glare of</p>
<p class="p1">the well-guarded eye. Every one but her husband, who, leaving his</p>
<p class="p1">daughters and their maids to unpack the boxes, followed her into her own</p>
<p class="p1">chamber, saying, as he fondly laid his hand upon her shoulder—</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“My darling doesn’t seem to be merry.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">She shrank—shuddered from his touch, exclaiming, almost shrilly—</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Leave me!”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Leave you, my dear!—my child,—why leave you?” he asked, passing his</p>
<p class="p1">hand gently around her shoulders.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Leave me, leave me!” she cried, sharply, casting off the arm and</p>
<p class="p1">springing back—her cheek blanched, her teeth snapping, her eyes</p>
<p class="p1">sparkling fire, more like a terrified wolf than a woman, “have I not</p>
<p class="p1">told you never, _never_ to come near me in my dark hour?”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“But why should my cherished pet have dark hours?” he persisted,</p>
<p class="p1">approaching her.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Keep off! keep off! old man, you know not what you do!”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Yes, I’m old—I know I’m old—I wish I wasn’t, for I love you, my</p>
<p class="p1">darling. Yes, I love you more tenderly and less selfishly than if I was</p>
<p class="p1">younger. I love you entirely—altogether—your little dark face—your</p>
<p class="p1">little fiery ways—your little outbursts of temper that no one sees but</p>
<p class="p1">me, who look upon it with indulgent eyes. Would a young man love you so</p>
<p class="p1">tenderly, Georgia?”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Driveller! you make me loathe you! ‘My little fiery ways.’ ‘My little</p>
<p class="p1">outbursts of temper,’ forsooth! How little do you understand me! You</p>
<p class="p1">sting my soul to frenzy with your dotage, and then twaddle about liking</p>
<p class="p1">my ‘_little outbursts of temper_,’ forsooth.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Dotage! Yes! I really do suppose you consider it dotage!”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Yes! drivelling! idiotic! imbecile dotage!”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Yes! I do suppose you think it is! I am too old for you, Georgia—I know</p>
<p class="p1">it, alas! too well, now that it is too late—and yet you did not raise</p>
<p class="p1">the least objection to becoming my wife, Georgia.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Ha! ha! ha! ha! ha! ha! ha! _Objection!_ I was but fifteen years of age</p>
<p class="p1">when you bribed me to your arms with a set of jewels, and a gold mounted</p>
<p class="p1">work-box! I was a child, delighted with glittering toys! and fond, yes!</p>
<p class="p1">_very_ fond of the grandfatherly old man that poured them into my lap!</p>
<p class="p1">Did _that_ child-fondness deceive you?”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“It did, it did! You were very fond of me when you were a child! Would</p>
<p class="p1">to God I could have spell-bound you to that age, so you never could have</p>
<p class="p1">grown older! Oh! I could find it in heart to shame my manhood, to shame</p>
<p class="p1">my gray hairs and weep! I should not have married you, Georgia, child! I</p>
<p class="p1">should not have sacrificed you to my selfish love—yet, no! It was _not_</p>
<p class="p1">selfish love! I wished your greatest good. I wished to surround you for</p>
<p class="p1">life with all the means and appliances of happiness. I wished to lavish</p>
<p class="p1">wealth upon you—ay, wealth of gold, and wealth of affection, too! I</p>
<p class="p1">wished to give you a sumptuous home, splendid apparel, costly jewels,</p>
<p class="p1">carriages, servants—all those things which women value so much, and</p>
<p class="p1">scheme, and plot, and endeavor for so perseveringly! I wished to give</p>
<p class="p1">them all to my darling, before she should have time to feel the need of</p>
<p class="p1">them!”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Ha! ha! ha! ha! ha!” bitterly laughed the girl. “Oh! do you know what</p>
<p class="p1">women value more than gold and jewels, and dress, and carriages, and</p>
<p class="p1">horses, and servants?—I’ll tell you—the ungalled, unfettered heart’s</p>
<p class="p1">freedom!”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“I know it! Oh! I know it! My love has destroyed your happiness. Oh,</p>
<p class="p1">Georgia! did you never see a beautiful bird, and long to have it for</p>
<p class="p1">your own, only to caress and pamper and pet it? Oh, Georgia! my child,</p>
<p class="p1">my pet, my bird! that was the reason I wanted you! I wanted to cherish,</p>
<p class="p1">and fondle, and make you happy!”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“_Ah-h!_ And did _you_ never see such a bird as you spoke of, in spite</p>
<p class="p1">of all the petting, and pampering, and fondlings, beat out its weary</p>
<p class="p1">life against its prison bars and die?”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Don’t die, Georgia! Don’t die! Hope! Alas! I wished only to make you</p>
<p class="p1">happy—I have failed! I have made you miserable!”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“‘_Miserable_,’ ruined! despairing! desperate!” she cried, wildly</p>
<p class="p1">wringing her hands.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Nay, not despairing, Georgia! I am an old man, as you justly</p>
<p class="p1">said—_quite_ an old man. I have not very long to live, and when I die,</p>
<p class="p1">Georgia, you will still be a very young woman. Bethink you, you are</p>
<p class="p1">scarce seventeen—in ten years more you will be but twenty-seven, and is</p>
<p class="p1">it even likely that I shall live so long as that? No! And after my heart</p>
<p class="p1">is cold, and my head is laid low, Georgia will be a beautiful young</p>
<p class="p1">widow—ay, and with a rich jointure, too! I shall take care of that!”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Ha! ha! ha! ha! ha! _pathetic!_ I tell you, that if you were to die</p>
<p class="p1">to-morrow, my life is not the less ruined—despairing!” bitterly</p>
<p class="p1">exclaimed the young woman.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Nay, but that cannot be, Georgia. Ruined? Despairing? What! at</p>
<p class="p1">seventeen years of age? Nonsense, my love! _Nothing_ but crime can make</p>
<p class="p1">the youthful despair! Nonsense, my child! You are hysterical!” he said,</p>
<p class="p1">moving towards her with outstretched arms.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Dotard! driveller!” she cried, turning fiercely upon him, with eyes</p>
<p class="p1">blazing with scorn and malignity. “_Imbecile!_ Will you leave me to</p>
<p class="p1">myself?”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">The old gentleman turned away, walked several times slowly up and down</p>
<p class="p1">the floor, and finally saying—</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Yes, I know I am a dotard! I know it, and I grow ashamed of dotage—”</p>
<p class="p1">clapped his hat upon his head and walked out.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Bitterly did the old man rue his folly, yet, alas! he knew but half the</p>
<p class="p1">cause of that ingrate and wretched woman’s fierce outbreaks of temper.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">She followed his retreating form, with a glaring of mingled rage and</p>
<p class="p1">fear, gnawing her white lips, while she muttered, in a low, fierce tone—</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“I could tear my heart out! I could bite my tongue off, for thus</p>
<p class="p1">betraying me! Shall I ever have power to chain and guide the tiger in</p>
<p class="p1">me? But _he_ with his doting, and _they_ with their dalliance, goad me</p>
<p class="p1">to extremity? _But_,” she exclaimed, clenching her fist, setting her</p>
<p class="p1">teeth, and glaring, while all her countenance darkened with rage and</p>
<p class="p1">anguish—“_But_, before they shall MARRY under my very eyes, and live</p>
<p class="p1">here, maddening my soul and senses, day and night, by the view of their</p>
<p class="p1">love and joy, I will pull down ruin on the heads of all! Yes, although</p>
<p class="p1">myself should be the first to fall!” She paused in silent thought some</p>
<p class="p1">time, then rising, said, “_Down_, tiger heart! _Down!_ crouch! Be</p>
<p class="p1">smooth, brow! Be smiling, lip! Be tender, eyes! Be soft, voice! And now</p>
<p class="p1">to go and pacify the old man, before his vexation betrays me to the</p>
<p class="p1">others. Ah! it is well _they_ have never witnessed my excitement! Come!</p>
<p class="p1">in time I shall learn to curb wild impulses, and only spring upon my</p>
<p class="p1">prey when time and place is fit!”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Soft, smooth, fascinating, seductive, she glided from her chamber out</p>
<p class="p1">into the upper piazza, where the old man’s slow and heavy footfall was</p>
<p class="p1">heard—she glided after him, and with an air of sweet, familiar, childish</p>
<p class="p1">freedom, she raised his arm, and putting her beautiful head under it,</p>
<p class="p1">drew his hand around her neck and over her bosom, and looking up</p>
<p class="p1">pleadingly, simply, into his benevolent face, murmured, merely—</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“I am so sorry Mr. Clifton!”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Never mind! never mind, my dear!” said the old gentleman, stooping and</p>
<p class="p1">kissing her brow.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Oh, but I _am_! _so sorry_!”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“You, child! Do you think I mind your little petulance?”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Oh! you are good, you are good. Indeed, I’m quite unworthy of you!” she</p>
<p class="p1">whispered softly, pressing her head against his bosom, and clinging</p>
<p class="p1">close.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“You, darling!” cried the old man, stroking her curls in delight.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“I am such an irritable, petulant child! I am sure no one would have</p>
<p class="p1">patience with me but you—that is the reason I love you so!”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“You do love me then?” gazing fondly in her witching face.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Oh, dearly! dearly! look in my eyes and see if I don’t!”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Yes! I know you do, my pet! And I love you entirely!”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Ah! how can you then! I have so many faults!”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“I love your little faults, and all! Come! Brighten up! Never mind! I</p>
<p class="p1">love to see my darling bright and cheerful.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Ah! how can I, when I remember my fit of ill temper!”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Say no more about it, my love! That’s the reason why I love you! For</p>
<p class="p1">those very little gusts of temper! They are followed by such a sweet</p>
<p class="p1">reaction! and then my child is so frank, so ingenuous in her little</p>
<p class="p1">penitence!”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Ah! But then I am such a spoiled child! And always was! Father spoiled</p>
<p class="p1">me. And now you spoil me worse than ever!”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“My sweet! you can’t be spoiled! you are so ingenuous! But now tell me,</p>
<p class="p1">what vexed my little girl this evening? Come, let me hear?” asked the</p>
<p class="p1">old man, caressing the syren.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Well! now it was this! I thought you loved Carolyn and Zuleime better</p>
<p class="p1">than me!” replied the artful woman, gazing half-reproachfully,</p>
<p class="p1">half-pleadingly up into his smiling face.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Love Carolyn and Zuleime better than you! Why you jealous little</p>
<p class="p1">witch!” exclaimed the old man in rapture. “Love _them_ more than you!</p>
<p class="p1">Why, I have to pray Heaven’s pardon daily, for not loving them a</p>
<p class="p1">hundredth part as much!—kiss me!”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Georgia nerved her loathing heart to give the demanded kiss, and then</p>
<p class="p1">went and joined the party in the parlor, as beautiful, smooth,</p>
<p class="p1">seductive, dangerous as ever; while the old man walked up and down the</p>
<p class="p1">piazza, smiling to himself and saying—</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“She is a child—nothing but a child!—a sweet, willful, witching child!”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Alas! little recking of the household treachery, the household wreck</p>
<p class="p1">that “child” was preparing!</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>

<p class="p1">What ruin a single spark of fire may spread, if carelessly or designedly</p>
<p class="p1">dropped amid combustible or inflammable material.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">What desolation a single word may cause, if thoughtlessly or</p>
<p class="p1">intentionally let fall into a passionate, impetuous heart.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">The three scenes I am about to describe, took place very nearly as they</p>
<p class="p1">are related.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">But first a few words of explanation.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">I feel that I have scarcely done justice to the character of Carolyn</p>
<p class="p1">Clifton, in presenting her only by that cold and frosty crust of pride,</p>
<p class="p1">which was but the superficial covering of a high-spirited, honorable</p>
<p class="p1">nature. Her manners were cold and haughty—almost scornful and</p>
<p class="p1">arrogant—it is but too true. And most people, her family included,</p>
<p class="p1">supposed her to be destitute of sensibility. Perhaps she was lacking in</p>
<p class="p1">warmth of affection for her immediate domestic circle. Her whole heart,</p>
<p class="p1">with all its deep, profound, untold, unguessed devotion, was given to</p>
<p class="p1">Archer Clifton. And while secretly bestowing upon him her entire,</p>
<p class="p1">undivided love—she openly exacted a full, unshared return—an exclusive</p>
<p class="p1">worship.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">In truth, in her proud, secret heart, she _was_ a little jealous of</p>
<p class="p1">Clifton’s affection for his mother! _She_ did not love her _father_ so</p>
<p class="p1">devotedly!—why should _Clifton_ worship his _mother_ so? To this</p>
<p class="p1">jealousy she had never given breath, of course—indeed, to her own</p>
<p class="p1">passionate love, she had never yet given word—preferring, in her high</p>
<p class="p1">toned, maiden pride, to leave it to be inferred. She had never even</p>
<p class="p1">_looked_ her jealousy, yet Mrs. Clifton, with the fine instinct of a</p>
<p class="p1">woman and a mother, guessed it, and in her presence, skillfully eluded</p>
<p class="p1">all demonstrations of affection from her son. And so well was the proud,</p>
<p class="p1">exacting spirit of Miss Clifton known in her own family, that even the</p>
<p class="p1">sprightly and mischievous outlaw, Zuleime, dared take no childish</p>
<p class="p1">liberty with her sister’s betrothed. Thus it happened that Frank</p>
<p class="p1">Fairfax’s unlucky jest had deeply offended the arrogant lady, the more</p>
<p class="p1">especially as in that day, and in that neighborhood, the term</p>
<p class="p1">“mountain-girl,” was too often the mildest name for an evil woman.—This</p>
<p class="p1">fact, of course, Frank was not acquainted with. And, therefore it was,</p>
<p class="p1">that he could not understand Carl Kavanagh’s excessive anxiety to send</p>
<p class="p1">his young sister off the mountain; and could not in the least comprehend</p>
<p class="p1">the intense indignation of Miss Clifton, and the difficulty Archer</p>
<p class="p1">Clifton had in restoring her good humor. Even now, Carolyn Clifton had</p>
<p class="p1">not forgotten the circumstance. And truth to tell, she was not well</p>
<p class="p1">pleased at the continued interest displayed by Captain Clifton for his</p>
<p class="p1">protégé, in bringing her and her family upon his mother’s plantation.</p>
<p class="p1">But she was too proud again to allude to the subject. Carolyn Clifton</p>
<p class="p1">had never known a care or a contradiction in her life. Her heart was a</p>
<p class="p1">sound, strong, high, proud thing, and therefore, very like to break</p>
<p class="p1">itself without fear, full tilt against the first impediment that opposed</p>
<p class="p1">it. She was, besides, like all women of her fair complexion and fine</p>
<p class="p1">tempered nerves—“a discerner of spirits.” And this quick, delicate, and</p>
<p class="p1">sure perception never failed her, except when she was agitated and</p>
<p class="p1">blinded by inward passion. Thus, perhaps, quite unconsciously, she read</p>
<p class="p1">the heart of her betrothed—and knew it better than he did himself—and</p>
<p class="p1">thus, perhaps, involuntarily, she afterwards acted on that knowledge.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">At all events, there was quite enough combustible material on hand for a</p>
<p class="p1">single spark to ignite it and spread a conflagration.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">And the spark—and many sparks were not wanting. A thoughtless jest of</p>
<p class="p1">Frank’s—a slight word dropped by Georgia at exactly the right, or rather</p>
<p class="p1">the _wrong_ time and place—and the whole neighborhood of R—— County were</p>
<p class="p1">agog with gossip. And Captain Clifton and his protégé, were the</p>
<p class="p1">subjects. Some, right in the face of his well-known engagement to Miss</p>
<p class="p1">Clifton, did not hesitate to say that she, his protégé, was a beautiful</p>
<p class="p1">girl, whom he intended to educate and marry, and that his republican</p>
<p class="p1">mother was highly in favor of the plan. Others told how tastefully the</p>
<p class="p1">overseer’s house had been furnished and adorned, and—without the</p>
<p class="p1">slightest foundation in truth—how many hours a day Captain Clifton now</p>
<p class="p1">spent with his interesting pupil. The suspicious and malignant</p>
<p class="p1">circulated a still darker tale, and wondered how long it would last, and</p>
<p class="p1">how it would all end. And then they denounced Captain Clifton, blamed</p>
<p class="p1">his mother, and pitied Miss Clifton! And all this time, while the whole</p>
<p class="p1">county was ringing with various and contradictory reports, the persons</p>
<p class="p1">most concerned knew nothing about it.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Until the day before the wedding, it was suddenly brought to the</p>
<p class="p1">knowledge of both parties, in the following manner:—</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">The company assembled at Clifton, consisting of old Mr. Clifton’s</p>
<p class="p1">brother-in-law and sister, Judge and Mrs. Cabell, of Richmond, with</p>
<p class="p1">their three daughters and son, Frank Fairfax, Zuleime, and Captain</p>
<p class="p1">Clifton, had gone over to dine by previous engagement with Mrs. Clifton,</p>
<p class="p1">of Hardbargain. Carolyn Clifton had been compelled, by a slight</p>
<p class="p1">headache, to remain at home. And Georgia had chosen to stay to keep her</p>
<p class="p1">company. The two ladies sat in the dressing-room of Miss Clifton.</p>
<p class="p1">Carolyn was silent and abstracted, yet her countenance betrayed more of</p>
<p class="p1">inward joy than she suspected. A great contrast was her fair, placid</p>
<p class="p1">face, to that of Georgia, dark, and traversed by spasms of pain-like</p>
<p class="p1">clouds hurling past a stormy sky. But if Carolyn lifted her fair lashes</p>
<p class="p1">a moment, instantly that dark face cleared, ere its expression could be</p>
<p class="p1">detected. At length she ventured, in a sweet tone, to say—</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Carolyn, my dear, to-morrow is your wedding-day. And—but—there is</p>
<p class="p1">something which you ought to know beforehand, and which for weeks past I</p>
<p class="p1">have been trying to gain courage to tell you.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Well, madam?” asked Miss Clifton, slowly lifting her snowy lids.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“I should—that is, I _might_ expose myself to the resentment of all your</p>
<p class="p1">family by telling you.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Then you had best not tell me, madam.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“And yet you ought to be informed, and must. _I_ should never forgive a</p>
<p class="p1">friend for keeping such a secret from me.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">A vague fear and tremor seized upon Carolyn Clifton, and kept her</p>
<p class="p1">silent. The dark lady went on—</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“I think the honor, the happiness, even the tranquillity of your married</p>
<p class="p1">life, depends upon your previous knowledge of this circumstance.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Madam—the honor, happiness, and tranquillity of my married life pass</p>
<p class="p1">into the keeping of my husband, Captain Clifton, and in him I have the</p>
<p class="p1">utmost confidence,” remarked Carolyn, coldly and proudly, though,</p>
<p class="p1">alas!—not _truly_.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Heaven forbid that I should unnecessarily mar that confidence! But, my</p>
<p class="p1">love, you will be sure to hear it, when too late, and from less friendly</p>
<p class="p1">lips than mine!”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Will it please you, then, madam, to speak out frankly and honestly, and</p>
<p class="p1">let us know what it is,” said Carolyn, scornfully, at the same time that</p>
<p class="p1">her heart was rising with emotion.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Is it possible you do not guess?”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“I do not take the trouble to do so, Mrs. Clifton.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Ah! you have always treated me with scorn and hauteur, Miss Clifton.</p>
<p class="p1">Yet that, alas! does not relieve me of the painful duty of putting you</p>
<p class="p1">on your guard. In a word, then, do you understand the nature of the</p>
<p class="p1">relations subsisting between Captain Clifton and the sister of his</p>
<p class="p1">mother’s overseer?”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">The brow of Carolyn Clifton flushed crimson—but she answered, coldly—</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Madam, I believe that young person has been the object of Captain</p>
<p class="p1">Clifton’s benevolence.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Ah! I believe so too! His benevolence is certainly indisputable, and</p>
<p class="p1">his honor _should_ be above suspicion!” exclaimed Georgia, fervently.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Madam—_it is_!” coldly replied Miss Clifton.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Yes—and yet, Carolyn, my love, a poor and beautiful young maiden cannot</p>
<p class="p1">continue to be the recipient of a handsome young officer’s beneficence</p>
<p class="p1">with credit to herself, honor to him, or _peace_ or safety to his wife!”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Is she so very beautiful?” was the question surmised from the haughty</p>
<p class="p1">girl.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Passing beautiful, I think, Carolyn, and this it is that makes the</p>
<p class="p1">country gentlemen jest so about the matter. _They_ give a far different</p>
<p class="p1">motive than _benevolence_ to the kindness of Captain Clifton to his</p>
<p class="p1">lovely charge. _I_ know that they do him gross injustice! But this thing</p>
<p class="p1">should not go on. It is a dangerous relation—dangerous to Archer’s own</p>
<p class="p1">fidelity, dangerous to your peace, and most dangerous of all, to the</p>
<p class="p1">poor girl’s reputation. I advise you to speak to Archer. I would do so</p>
<p class="p1">myself, but it is too delicate a matter for me to speak to a young</p>
<p class="p1">gentleman about. Now in these palmy days of courtship, he may listen to</p>
<p class="p1">you as he never would, perhaps, afterwards, and you will be able to</p>
<p class="p1">prevail with him to send this dangerous young beauty, his protégé, away.</p>
<p class="p1">Yes! and you may tell Archer that _I_ advise this, for the good of all</p>
<p class="p1">parties. Tell him that the whole neighborhood is ringing with gossip</p>
<p class="p1">that may become slander. Tell him that I say the parties most concerned</p>
<p class="p1">in this rumor, or in any rumor, will be ever the last to hear it. Tell</p>
<p class="p1">him that I, his friend, Georgia, venture to do him this service,</p>
<p class="p1">informing him through you. Let there be no concealments. Let all be open</p>
<p class="p1">candor. I did feel afraid, when I began to tell you this—but now it is</p>
<p class="p1">out, I feel relieved—I have more courage.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Madam!” said Carolyn, more haughtily than before—“Captain Clifton is</p>
<p class="p1">quite capable of directing his own conduct! And if he were _not_, I</p>
<p class="p1">should never resign to him the future control of mine! And, farthermore,</p>
<p class="p1">madam!” she added, sarcastically, “I too highly honor the man about to</p>
<p class="p1">become my husband—I have too much self-respect and delicacy, to inquire</p>
<p class="p1">into the nature of Captain Clifton’s individual and private amusements,</p>
<p class="p1">whether they relate to hounds, horses, or beggar girls! I leave such</p>
<p class="p1">investigations to——_the daughter of the sign-painter_!” and with an air</p>
<p class="p1">of the greatest possible scorn and arrogance, she arose, and left the</p>
<p class="p1">room. Yet under that proud, disdainful bearing, a thousand scorpions, of</p>
<p class="p1">doubt and jealousy, maddened her soul. She went at once into her own</p>
<p class="p1">room, and having locked the door, that no rash intruder should look upon</p>
<p class="p1">her weakness, gave herself up to the anguish of her emotions—now pacing</p>
<p class="p1">up and down the floor, wringing her hands in distraction—now throwing</p>
<p class="p1">herself, face downward, upon the bed, in despair. And yet she had no</p>
<p class="p1">confidence in Mrs. Clifton’s honesty of purpose either.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">                  </span>* <span class="Apple-converted-space">      </span>* <span class="Apple-converted-space">      </span>* <span class="Apple-converted-space">      </span>* <span class="Apple-converted-space">      </span>*</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">In the meantime, the party assembled at Hardbargain were enjoying</p>
<p class="p1">themselves and the hospitalities of their hostess, to the fullest</p>
<p class="p1">extent.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">The late dinner was over; the ladies were lounging about in arm-chairs,</p>
<p class="p1">or on sofas, in the breezy parlor—dozing, reading, or chatting in low</p>
<p class="p1">tones, all serenely enjoying that pleasant feeling of home freedom and</p>
<p class="p1">repose, into which Mrs. Clifton ever charmed her guests.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">The gentlemen had left their wine, and in parties of two and three were</p>
<p class="p1">strolling about the shady yard, or out through the fields and orchards,</p>
<p class="p1">to cool their heads, previous to joining the ladies at the tea-table.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Archer Clifton, with his cousin, Major Charles Cabell, and Frank</p>
<p class="p1">Fairfax, took the wooded path leading down the South side of the ridge</p>
<p class="p1">to a fine spring in the hollow. They came to a log cabin, half hidden by</p>
<p class="p1">surrounding and overhanging elms—and literally covered with climbing and</p>
<p class="p1">creeping vines. Before the door sat a girl, spinning on a little wheel,</p>
<p class="p1">who, at the first glimpse of strangers, instantly arose, and taking up</p>
<p class="p1">her wheel, retired into the house. Captain Clifton left his companions,</p>
<p class="p1">and going up to the door, called, saying—</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Catherine, my good girl, bring me a gourd here.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Kate Kavanagh came, and with her eyes fixed upon the ground, and her</p>
<p class="p1">face suffused with a deep blush, handed the required article, and</p>
<p class="p1">instantly disappeared within.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“By all the angels, what a fine face!” exclaimed Major Cabell, gazing</p>
<p class="p1">after her.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Archer Clifton shot a quick, piercing glance at the speaker, who,</p>
<p class="p1">meeting it full as he turned, laughed, exclaiming, as if a new discovery</p>
<p class="p1">had been made—</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Oh! Ay! Soh! you are _there_, are you? So then, this is the</p>
<p class="p1">mountain-beauty, the hidden treasure of Archer Clifton, that has set all</p>
<p class="p1">the country ladies agog with scandal, and all the country gentlemen mad</p>
<p class="p1">with envy?”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">The hot blood rushed to Clifton’s brow.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Oh! now, don’t be jealous! Don’t be alarmed! Your treasure is safe from</p>
<p class="p1">me—though, by all the queens of chivalry, hers is a noble face—a face to</p>
<p class="p1">bleed and die for! None of your pretty lily and rose baby beauties that</p>
<p class="p1">may be seen by hundreds anywhere—but a noble girl, fit for a monarch’s</p>
<p class="p1">love and counsellor!”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">In an instant Archer Clifton strode up and stood with bended brow and</p>
<p class="p1">folded arms before him; and said, in a low, deep, stern tone of</p>
<p class="p1">concentrated passion—</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“You are my relative, friend, guest! Your three-fold claim upon my</p>
<p class="p1">forbearance should protect you from any resentment for words spoken</p>
<p class="p1">against _my_ honor. But, I charge you, retract your words! And if you</p>
<p class="p1">harbor one single suspicion against that young girl, you are a villain!</p>
<p class="p1">S’death, sir! Has the world come to such a pass, and is the honor of</p>
<p class="p1">Archer Clifton of so little worth, that he cannot protect a poor young</p>
<p class="p1">maiden without injury to her? By Heaven! be warned! For if you do but</p>
<p class="p1">breathe one breath to dim the lustre of that girl’s good name—by the</p>
<p class="p1">good Lord that made us good, and the demon that turned us to evil!</p>
<p class="p1">relative, friend and guest as you are, I will slay and drag you to her</p>
<p class="p1">feet to die!”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">So sudden, so mighty—so appalling was this burst of passion, that for a</p>
<p class="p1">moment after it was over, Cabell and Fairfax stood as if transfixed with</p>
<p class="p1">astonishment. Then Cabell, in the frankest way in the world, held out</p>
<p class="p1">his hand, exclaiming—</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“I like that! D—d if I don’t! Come, Clifton—I was wrong, forgive me!</p>
<p class="p1">give me your hand! By my soul, I like a man that will stand up</p>
<p class="p1">for—there! by all that’s fatal, I had liked to have tripped again!”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Understand me, sir,” said Archer Clifton, sternly. “You know me to be</p>
<p class="p1">on the eve of marriage with our cousin. She is my liege lady, and never</p>
<p class="p1">for one instant in thought, word or deed, has my allegiance swerved from</p>
<p class="p1">her service. And more, gentlemen, both! A single word touching the fair</p>
<p class="p1">fame of _her_—of Catherine, I mean—touches _me home_.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">They were here overtaken by two or three other gentlemen, and the</p>
<p class="p1">conversation took another and less perilous turn, as they wandered down</p>
<p class="p1">towards the mineral spring. After slaking their thirst, the party</p>
<p class="p1">divided. Major Cabell joined the three latest comers, and Clifton and</p>
<p class="p1">Fairfax turned towards the farm-house.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“You seem to be moody this evening, Archer,” said Frank, after they had</p>
<p class="p1">pursued their way for some time in silence.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Yes—that foolish jest of Cabell’s has annoyed me. It is villainous! It</p>
<p class="p1">is diabolical! Such light words, in which a young girl’s fair fame is</p>
<p class="p1">laughed and jested away, may be thoughtless, but they should be punished</p>
<p class="p1">with death!”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“That’s a harsh sentence!”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“A _just_ one!”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“You feel this bitterly!”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“I DO. For _her_ name has been used! Frank! you believe that if a word</p>
<p class="p1">of disrespect were to be breathed by any man against my mother, I would</p>
<p class="p1">lay that man dead at my feet without an instant’s grace?”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Yes! I thoroughly believe that you would send such an one to his last</p>
<p class="p1">account in a great hurry.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“And if any one were but to _look_ an insult to Catherine, it would</p>
<p class="p1">rouse all the ferocity of the demon in me to overthrow and trample him</p>
<p class="p1">to death!”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“‘All this I steadfastly believe,’ as the catechism says about total</p>
<p class="p1">depravity!”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“And, Frank! you, yourself have sometimes spoken flippantly of my regard</p>
<p class="p1">for that girl—never so insultingly as Cabell did just now, else you</p>
<p class="p1">would not now possess my esteem and friendship—but you have _trifled_</p>
<p class="p1">with the subject. Now understand, Frank, that I shall consider it a deep</p>
<p class="p1">personal affront in future if you repeat it!”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“You haven’t heard me joke to you about Kate for a long time.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“No—I certainly have not.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“No—for be hanged if the matter is not getting far too _serious_ for</p>
<p class="p1">jesting!”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“What do you mean?”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Archer! Have you never heard it said that those whom it concerns</p>
<p class="p1">_first_ to be made acquainted with an injurious report are usually the</p>
<p class="p1">_last_ to hear it, and when they are _innocent_, they are the more</p>
<p class="p1">exposed for _being_ innocent, because they never _suspect_ the slander,</p>
<p class="p1">and never _guard_ against it?”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“In Heaven’s name, what do you mean?”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“_This_. Cabell’s jest was but the echo of the whole county talk. I have</p>
<p class="p1">been asked, I suppose, twenty times, by twenty different young men, to</p>
<p class="p1">tell them all about our adventure upon the mountain.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“That was because _you_ first of all represented it as an adventure.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“I confess it! In shame and confusion I confess it—but then many times I</p>
<p class="p1">am also asked what is the precise nature of the relations subsisting</p>
<p class="p1">between yourself and this girl?”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“No, NO!”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Yes, I tell you!”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“No! no one dares to question that!”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“But they _do_, I tell you! Ay, and _answer_ their own questions in a</p>
<p class="p1">manner that reflects very little honor upon the parties!”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Would God I had never seen the girl! Would God I had never brought her</p>
<p class="p1">here! I would give my right hand rather than evil should befall her! But</p>
<p class="p1">who is it that dares slander her? Tell me! Give me some name! Let me</p>
<p class="p1">have SOME one to make an example of!”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Nay, Clifton! you can’t make an example of women and children!” said</p>
<p class="p1">Frank, evasively.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“By Heaven, sir, they have husbands and fathers, who shall be held</p>
<p class="p1">accountable for the license of tongue they allow their wives and</p>
<p class="p1">daughters!”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Nay, now, Archer! This is a mere matter of gossip, that will die out,</p>
<p class="p1">if you are discreet!”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“To dare to talk of _her_! They never looked upon her face! Else they</p>
<p class="p1">never could associate the thought of evil with that noble brow, those</p>
<p class="p1">thoughtful eyes, and serious lips! To slander _her_!”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Nay, nay—it is _not_ slander; only what I am afraid should _become_</p>
<p class="p1">such. It is only fun—joke—”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“To dare to joke of _her_!”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“‘_Her!_’ Verily, Clifton, any one to hear you breathe ‘_her!_’ with</p>
<p class="p1">your full soul’s volume poured into the little word, would think there</p>
<p class="p1">was but one ‘_her_’ in the world! Archy, you take a very strange</p>
<p class="p1">interest in that girl. Are you sure that you are not in love with her?”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“In love with her! Nonsense—she is a child!”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Well then, are you sure you should not be in love with her, if she were</p>
<p class="p1">a woman?”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Ridiculous! She is a low-born girl!”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Oh I forgot! I beg pardon! You demonstrated that to me before.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“And, besides, sir, please to remember that all my love and faith are</p>
<p class="p1">due to my cousin, Miss Clifton; and that _she_ has my whole heart! I</p>
<p class="p1">love, admire, honor, my beautiful betrothed bride—nor for her proud sake</p>
<p class="p1">will I brook that any one should think it possible that I could even in</p>
<p class="p1">thought fail in full loyalty to my liege lady! But, Frank! my soul’s</p>
<p class="p1">dear brother! as I tell you everything, I will tell you this! that I</p>
<p class="p1">feel the very deepest interest in Catherine’s welfare! If you ask me</p>
<p class="p1">_why_—I tell you I do not know! It surprises and confounds myself! But</p>
<p class="p1">from the first moment I looked upon her noble face, I felt that interest</p>
<p class="p1">stir within my deepest soul. And it has never since ceased!”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“I swear you are enamored of her!”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Preposterous, Frank! you make me angry! It is a very different thing</p>
<p class="p1">from being enamored of her, let me tell you! There is my beautiful, but</p>
<p class="p1">cold and scornful bride, up at Clifton! Well, I am the most patient of</p>
<p class="p1">all adoring slaves! I wait upon her sovereign eyes all day long! I am</p>
<p class="p1">proud to submit to her whims—to do her lightest bidding, and pick up her</p>
<p class="p1">lap-dog—or to obey her severest command, and exile myself from her</p>
<p class="p1">gracious presence all day long! But now observe the difference! I feel a</p>
<p class="p1">deep, strong, strange interest in Kate. I cannot account for it. I feel</p>
<p class="p1">a sort of unratified right of property in her. I wish to do her good.</p>
<p class="p1">But I wish that all the good she may ever possess in the world, may come</p>
<p class="p1">from only me! and that for all good things with which I cannot supply</p>
<p class="p1">her, she may _suffer_ the want rather than owe their possession to</p>
<p class="p1">another! Very like _love_, is it not? But I wish to control her destiny!</p>
<p class="p1">I wish to have her in my power!—_in all honor, however!_ It galls me to</p>
<p class="p1">think that I have no right of authority or guardianship over her! I</p>
<p class="p1">ardently desire such a right! I long to have the disposal of her person</p>
<p class="p1">and fate! I crave with a frantic craving, to have more than a</p>
<p class="p1">father’s—more than a husband’s—more than a master’s right over her! I</p>
<p class="p1">would to God she were born mine—my own—body, soul and spirit! My own to</p>
<p class="p1">use or abuse—to crown or kill, as I listed!” exclaimed Clifton,</p>
<p class="p1">passionately, while his cheeks and very lips were white and dry, and his</p>
<p class="p1">eyes burned with a fierce, consuming, inward fire. And forgetting all</p>
<p class="p1">things real, he felt as in a vision, a girl’s spirit swoop down upon his</p>
<p class="p1">bosom, and a dream voice murmur in his ear—“Oh! if it will give you one</p>
<p class="p1">instant’s joy to press me strongly to your heart—crush me to death in</p>
<p class="p1">the fold, and my soul will exhale in rapture to Heaven.” The fervid</p>
<p class="p1">vision came and passed like lightning, and Clifton roused himself from</p>
<p class="p1">reverie, with a smile and a sneer, saying—“Very like love, all that! is</p>
<p class="p1">it not?”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">But as Frank did not reply, and as they had now arrived at the gate</p>
<p class="p1">leading into the yard, the conversation ceased.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">The early tea-table was set out under the shade of the great oaks, and</p>
<p class="p1">the ladies were walking about, taking the evening air in the yard. As</p>
<p class="p1">supper was only waiting the arrival of Captain Clifton and Mr. Fairfax,</p>
<p class="p1">it was now speedily served.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">After tea was over, the carriages were all brought round and the company</p>
<p class="p1">took leave of Mrs. Clifton, and departed.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Captain Clifton and Mr. Fairfax were the last to leave. They mounted</p>
<p class="p1">their horses and took the bridle-path down the mountain side. This</p>
<p class="p1">separated them from the rest of their party, who went by the road. They</p>
<p class="p1">did not, however, converse. Frank was thoughtful, and Clifton himself</p>
<p class="p1">buried in a deep reverie.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">It was quite early when they arrived at White Cliffs; and the remainder</p>
<p class="p1">of the party had not yet arrived. Mr. Fairfax joined Mrs. Clifton in the</p>
<p class="p1">garden, and Archer Clifton sought his lady-love, where he was informed</p>
<p class="p1">he would find her, namely, in the Summer saloon. He threw down his hat</p>
<p class="p1">and entered hurriedly, intending to surprise from her a hasty kiss.</p>
<p class="p1">Carolyn was standing looking out of the window upon the rich sunset</p>
<p class="p1">scene—the last sun that would set upon her maiden life, perhaps, she</p>
<p class="p1">thought. On seeing Clifton she moved away, and retreated to the</p>
<p class="p1">work-table at which she seated herself. Clifton approached, and with an</p>
<p class="p1">air of gallantry, half serious, half playful, kneeled upon one knee and</p>
<p class="p1">kissed her hand. She drew it coldly away—but that was the custom of the</p>
<p class="p1">“proud ladie,” and did not surprise her lover. He arose and drew a chair</p>
<p class="p1">to her side and seated himself, and began to affect an interest in her</p>
<p class="p1">little lady-like occupations. Her right hand rested upon a pile of</p>
<p class="p1">beautifully fine linen cambric handkerchiefs—an item in the imported</p>
<p class="p1">trousseau. He laid his hand upon hers, and asked her some trivial</p>
<p class="p1">question about them.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Now, Carolyn, after a day’s extreme suffering, had almost gained a</p>
<p class="p1">victory over her passion. Her haughtiness had almost saved her. Not to</p>
<p class="p1">one soul in that house—not to Georgia, had she betrayed the least sign</p>
<p class="p1">of the cruel suspicion that had nearly maddened her brain. Not for all</p>
<p class="p1">Clifton—not for all the world would she have betrayed her passion to her</p>
<p class="p1">lover—or condescended to admit that she could be jealous of him; for she</p>
<p class="p1">felt that once to accuse him would be to impose upon her the necessity</p>
<p class="p1">of breaking with him. How could she, in honor, marry a man to-morrow</p>
<p class="p1">whom to-day she had accused of treachery?—besides, she was not</p>
<p class="p1">sure—could never be sure of his moral dereliction. And while there was a</p>
<p class="p1">doubt in his favor, she must conquer or conceal all suspicion, or,</p>
<p class="p1">letting escape, must break with him, even at this last moment—must break</p>
<p class="p1">with him forever! At least so her high spirit and her pride argued. She</p>
<p class="p1">could not part with him—pride forbade that also.—What! the marriage of</p>
<p class="p1">Miss Clifton of Clifton broken off at the last moment, and all about a</p>
<p class="p1">mountain-girl? Pah! Forbid it, all the shades of all the buried</p>
<p class="p1">Cliftons! Hearts might break, but haughty heads must not be bowed!</p>
<p class="p1">Better lost peace than lost place! And then she loved him!—loved him the</p>
<p class="p1">deeper for suppressing all signs of love!—and she could not bear to lose</p>
<p class="p1">him! And banish him she must, if she should once betray the jealous</p>
<p class="p1">passion of her heart. This mighty motive kept down the rising storm. Yet</p>
<p class="p1">all depended upon her vigilant self-control. Should a look, a word of</p>
<p class="p1">suspicion, escape her then, she felt the curbed frenzy of her soul would</p>
<p class="p1">have broken all bounds; even as by the smallest fracture in the dyke,</p>
<p class="p1">the mighty and irresistible sea is let in upon the land, carrying</p>
<p class="p1">destruction and death before it! All depended on her silence. So, to</p>
<p class="p1">keep her lover from noticing her mood,—or fatally inquiring its</p>
<p class="p1">cause—and to give him employment, she pushed the pile of handkerchiefs</p>
<p class="p1">towards him, saying calmly—</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Mark them for me.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Clifton smilingly took them, found the little vial of indelible ink, and</p>
<p class="p1">went to work—himself well pleased to have some service to perform for</p>
<p class="p1">his liege lady, that would, without disrespect to _her_, deliver _him_</p>
<p class="p1">from the duty of keeping up a running conversation, for which he felt</p>
<p class="p1">indisposed.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">She need not have feared that Archer Clifton would observe her mood. He</p>
<p class="p1">himself was too abstracted, too thoughtful, to be critical or</p>
<p class="p1">inquisitive. He was deeply troubled by the recollection of the</p>
<p class="p1">conversations of the afternoon, affecting Kate Kavanagh. Instead of</p>
<p class="p1">benefiting, had he really wronged that excellent girl?—darkened the very</p>
<p class="p1">morning of her just opening life with the clouds of suspicion? And was</p>
<p class="p1">even his mother’s protection insufficient to shield her innocence from</p>
<p class="p1">such attacks of slander? Yes!—for the _fact_ of his mother’s protection</p>
<p class="p1">was not even acknowledged. Slander shuts its eyes to truth, while it</p>
<p class="p1">opens its lips to falsehood. Should he send her back to the mountain,</p>
<p class="p1">and expose her to all the evils of that life? No, no!—his whole heart</p>
<p class="p1">protested against that course. Yet what to do to save her? He could not</p>
<p class="p1">decide then. He could not even get his own consent to consult his</p>
<p class="p1">mother. What! wound _her_ ear with the repetition of such a story?</p>
<p class="p1">Never! His usual promptitude of decision and action forsook him quite. A</p>
<p class="p1">cry was in his heart, and he could only repeat to himself her _name_ in</p>
<p class="p1">deep sorrow,—“Oh, Kate! Kate! Kate Kavanagh!” until her very name “_Kate</p>
<p class="p1">Kavanagh_,” became the refrain of a plaintive _silent_ melody! Meantime</p>
<p class="p1">he pursued his occupation quite mechanically, marking and laying down,</p>
<p class="p1">one by one, the handkerchiefs, until the whole dozen was complete.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Carolyn Clifton watched his complete and mournful abstraction with</p>
<p class="p1">increasing suspicion.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">When all the handkerchiefs were marked, he took the parcel, and shaking</p>
<p class="p1">off sad thought, smilingly laid them before his lady’s eyes, gayly</p>
<p class="p1">entreating her to examine his work, and reward him with a kindly word if</p>
<p class="p1">it should please her.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Miss Clifton took up the parcel, her eyes fell upon the topmost</p>
<p class="p1">handkerchief, and she started violently. She swiftly turned it over and</p>
<p class="p1">looked at the second, and the blood rushed to her brow! At the third,</p>
<p class="p1">and it receded again, leaving her pale as death! She hurriedly went</p>
<p class="p1">through the dozen, then springing to her feet, she hurled the parcel to</p>
<p class="p1">the floor, and setting her heel upon it, lifted her proud form to its</p>
<p class="p1">loftiest height, and stood, her chest expanded, her head thrown back,</p>
<p class="p1">her cheek kindling, her eyes blazing,—full! full!—yet proudly</p>
<p class="p1">suppressing all utterance of passion! Captain Clifton started to his</p>
<p class="p1">feet, exclaiming—</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Carolyn, my dear cousin!”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">But spurning the parcel beneath her heel, she turned imperiously away,</p>
<p class="p1">and walked up the room.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">He followed her, repeating—</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Carolyn, my dearest Carolyn! what is it?”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Turning and flashing upon him her fierce, imperious eyes, she stretched</p>
<p class="p1">out her arm, and pointed in scornful silence to the handkerchiefs on the</p>
<p class="p1">floor.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">He went and picked them up to examine them. Oh! treacherous absence of</p>
<p class="p1">mind! Oh! fatal refrain of the mental melody! Oh! horror of horrors!</p>
<p class="p1">Catastrophe of catastrophes! Upon every handkerchief was beautifully</p>
<p class="p1">marked—“KATE KAVANAGH.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">                             </span>“Confirmation strong</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">                       </span>As proof from Holy Writ.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Ay, and a great deal stronger, as sight is more convincing than faith!</p>
<p class="p1">What was to be done? It was in vain to deny or attempt to explain it!</p>
<p class="p1">Yet he must try, even if he should make himself ridiculous. Hurling the</p>
<p class="p1">fatal “handkerchiefs” down with virulence, he sprang to the side of the</p>
<p class="p1">outraged and indignant beauty; seized her hand, exclaiming, vehemently—</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“My dearest love—pardon! pardon! This is all a mistake!”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Spurning his clasp from her hand, she turned away in arrogant silence.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Dropping upon one knee, he took her hand again, and looking up in her</p>
<p class="p1">face, said, in a voice of entreaty—</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“My Carolyn! this is all a mistake!—the most absurd mistake! The effect</p>
<p class="p1">of the merest absence of mind! The most ridiculous thing!”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Oh, sir!” she answered, with slow and withering scorn, drawing her hand</p>
<p class="p1">away again, “I do not doubt it was a mistake. I never supposed you would</p>
<p class="p1">dare an intentional insult to my father’s daughter!”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“But, Carolyn, my dearest cousin, only permit me to explain—”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Oh, sir, I _entreat_ you spare me the humiliation of hearing the</p>
<p class="p1">story!” she sneered, with curling lip.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“But, Carolyn, my dear, loved bride! My bride, that will be,</p>
<p class="p1">to-morrow—if you will allow me to tell you all the simple truth—the</p>
<p class="p1">_reason_ why this young girl’s name ran in my head so.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Oh, sir,” she exclaimed, raising both hands, and turning away her head</p>
<p class="p1">in loathing—“I _implore_ you!—I most _humbly beseech_ you to forbear!</p>
<p class="p1">Spare me _details_ that might shock my—delicacy!”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Carolyn,” he said, gravely and reproachfully rising, and taking her</p>
<p class="p1">hand—“this does not become you.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Throwing off his hand, with scorn and indignation, she replied—</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“It would less become me, sir, to listen to the history you would tell.”</p>
<p class="p1">Then subsiding into a mood of contemptuous irony, she said, with a</p>
<p class="p1">sneering smile—“Believe me, sir, I feel more disgusted at your bad taste</p>
<p class="p1">than shocked at your sin, or wronged by your bad faith. _A</p>
<p class="p1">mountain-girl!_ Truly, I am humiliated to think so base a rival should</p>
<p class="p1">have moved me—even to contempt. I am dishonored, sir, in that. Had your</p>
<p class="p1">wandering fancy fixed upon one of my cousins—one of the elegant Misses</p>
<p class="p1">Cabell, I might have mourned your infidelity, but should have been saved</p>
<p class="p1">this deep humiliation for myself, and this utter contempt for you—but _a</p>
<p class="p1">mountain-girl_! A coarse, ignorant, ill-bred mountain-girl! _Oh-h-h!_</p>
<p class="p1">that you should have stooped, or I should have been moved, by so low a</p>
<p class="p1">creature as that! I could bury my head with shame!”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Carolyn!” he said, sternly, “permit me to inform you—”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“No, SIR!” she exclaimed, scorn writhing her lips, indignation flashing</p>
<p class="p1">from her eyes—“No, SIR! You shall tell me NOTHING! It would ill-become</p>
<p class="p1">my mother’s daughter to listen to the revolting history of—your base</p>
<p class="p1">amour with the mountain-girl!”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Yes, in the bitterness of her passion, she forgot her maiden delicacy,</p>
<p class="p1">and spoke those shameful words to his astonished ears!</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Miss Clifton!” he replied, severely, folding his arms and gazing</p>
<p class="p1">sternly and steadily into her blushing face—for she was already blushing</p>
<p class="p1">for her temerity—until she quailed before him—“Miss Clifton, you mistake</p>
<p class="p1">my purpose—I have no intention, _now_, to explain anything—the man who</p>
<p class="p1">would condescend to _deny_ so base a crime as you have charged upon</p>
<p class="p1">_me_—is not too high or pure to commit it. Therefore, I deign to say</p>
<p class="p1">nothing for myself. But for the admirable girl that you have slandered—I</p>
<p class="p1">will say _this_: Had a _man_ dared to asperse the fair fame of Catherine</p>
<p class="p1">Kavanagh—though that man had been my bosom friend—he should have</p>
<p class="p1">expiated his falsehood with his life:—Had any other _woman_ breathed a</p>
<p class="p1">breath of slander on her—her husband or her father should have atoned</p>
<p class="p1">for the fault:—For yourself, Miss Clifton—you shall retract your words,</p>
<p class="p1">before ever I shall call you wife!”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">This roused her passion to ungovernable fury. Turning ghastly white,</p>
<p class="p1">while the light seemed to leap from her eyes, she exclaimed, in a low,</p>
<p class="p1">deep, intense tone—</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“DEATH, sir! Do you threaten me? Insult me in my father’s house? Leave</p>
<p class="p1">it! You are unworthy to stand upon this floor! BEGONE!” And reaching out</p>
<p class="p1">her hand, she seized the bell cord, and rang a peal that presently</p>
<p class="p1">brought a servant to the door. The advent of a third party, though that</p>
<p class="p1">party was a menial, constrained the lady to remember herself. Miss</p>
<p class="p1">Clifton was her cold, serene, dignified self again. Turning to the</p>
<p class="p1">servant, she said, haughtily, “Show Captain Clifton to the front door,</p>
<p class="p1">and bring round his horse, instantly. He returns to Hardbargain,</p>
<p class="p1">to-night.” And she bowed to Clifton, and calmly and imperiously walked</p>
<p class="p1">from the room.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">The man stood waiting and bowing. Captain Clifton snatched his hat,</p>
<p class="p1">saying—</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Let my horse be brought round, without delay, Dandy, and tell your</p>
<p class="p1">master, when he returns, that he shall hear from me at Hardbargain.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">When the man had bowed and retired, Captain Clifton passed out through</p>
<p class="p1">the open leaf of the window, into the piazza, and thence down into the</p>
<p class="p1">lawn, to speak to Frank, who was just entering from the garden with Mrs.</p>
<p class="p1">Clifton on his arm.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Georgia saw at a glance, that her train of gunpowder had caught, and the</p>
<p class="p1">magazine had blown up, and her dark, beautiful, demoniac, witching face</p>
<p class="p1">lighted up with a lurid joy for one unguarded instant, and then all was</p>
<p class="p1">self-recollection, self-control, and sweet, smooth, serene, alluring</p>
<p class="p1">glamour.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Bowing deeply to Mrs. Clifton, he said—</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Madam, an unexpected event sends me from Clifton this evening. Pray</p>
<p class="p1">make my adieus to my uncle and cousin. And permit me to commend my</p>
<p class="p1">friend here to your hospitable care until such time as he pleases to</p>
<p class="p1">become my guest at Hardbargain—if, indeed, he will not ride thither with</p>
<p class="p1">me to-night,” he added, turning to Frank.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Fairfax was too surprised to speak.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Mrs. Clifton, who was not surprised at all, yet affected much interest,</p>
<p class="p1">said, archly—</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Oh, but we shall see you back very early to-morrow morning!”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“I regret to add, madam, that it is not likely,” he said, with another</p>
<p class="p1">bow; then turning to Frank, he asked—</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Will you ride with me to-night, Fairfax?”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Frank glanced at the lady on his arm, and then looking rebukingly at</p>
<p class="p1">Clifton, begged to be excused.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Well, then, you are my guest, Fairfax, and my mother has often pressed</p>
<p class="p1">you to give her a few weeks of your company. Join me at Hardbargain as</p>
<p class="p1">soon as possible—the sooner the better. To-morrow even—”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“_To-morrow!_” archly smiled the wily lady. “_To-morrow_, I fancy, his</p>
<p class="p1">attendance and your own will be required _here_. Do you _forget_?—Well,</p>
<p class="p1">that is the worst instance of absence of mind I ever saw or heard of! A</p>
<p class="p1">young bridegroom to forget, for an instant, his wedding-day! Too bad,</p>
<p class="p1">even for _you_, the notoriously-absent-minded Archer Clifton!”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Not wishing to enter into explanations, Captain Clifton merely replied</p>
<p class="p1">with another bow—a most convenient, safe and polite manner of answer,</p>
<p class="p1">since, without lack of courtesy, it committed nothing.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Then, taking leave of both lady and gentleman, and repeating his</p>
<p class="p1">invitation to Frank, he turned and went to take his horse from the</p>
<p class="p1">servant that held it, threw himself up into the saddle, and, with a</p>
<p class="p1">parting wave of his hat, rode away at full speed.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Clifton looks darkly—what can be the matter?” asked Frank.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Oh, nothing! probably Mrs. Clifton, of Hardbargain, has been troubled</p>
<p class="p1">with some refractory servant, and has sent for her son to come up and</p>
<p class="p1">reduce him to order—or possibly there may be some dispute or difficulty</p>
<p class="p1">in settling the demands of the hired harvest hands. They are often even</p>
<p class="p1">dishonest in their extortions.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Deferring to your better judgment, madam, still, I fear not! I think</p>
<p class="p1">such trifles would scarcely have raised so dark a thunder-cloud upon</p>
<p class="p1">Clifton’s brow,” said Frank.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Oh, well! At worst it is but some lover’s quarrel with his most</p>
<p class="p1">exacting queen, Carolyn!” playfully replied the lady.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Frank was not satisfied—he was pained. This most dangerous dark beauty</p>
<p class="p1">fascinated and frightened him by turns. He had never seen the fiend in</p>
<p class="p1">her face since that first night, and her witching power had almost</p>
<p class="p1">erased the remembrance of it from his mind. Indeed, if he had ever</p>
<p class="p1">recollected it, it was with wonder and remorse that he should have ever</p>
<p class="p1">read such fearful meaning in a lady’s frown, and he ascribed it to the</p>
<p class="p1">phantasmagoria of his own fatigued nerves and over-excited brain. But</p>
<p class="p1">now he felt vaguely anxious, suspicious, foreboding—he scarce knew</p>
<p class="p1">wherefore. He had no reason to reply to the lady again, for at the</p>
<p class="p1">instant she finished speaking, the carriages drove into the yard,</p>
<p class="p1">bringing the company from Hardbargain, and they walked forward to</p>
<p class="p1">welcome them home.</p>

<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Some hours after the arrival of the company, old Mr. Clifton sat alone</p>
<p class="p1">in his study, examining piles of accounts, merchants’, mechanics’, and</p>
<p class="p1">hired laborers’ bills, that had come in as usual upon the first of July,</p>
<p class="p1">many weeks before, yet had not, up to this night, been settled. For many</p>
<p class="p1">years past the financial affairs of the Master of Clifton had been</p>
<p class="p1">falling behindhand. The cause of this was that no plantation and</p>
<p class="p1">plantation house can thoroughly succeed without the personal</p>
<p class="p1">superintendence of an efficient _mistress_ to assist the master’s</p>
<p class="p1">effort. Often, indeed, it happens, that while the master himself is</p>
<p class="p1">engaged in state politics, or off at the legislature, or at congress, or</p>
<p class="p1">on the circuit as a judge of the court, or in the metropolis of the</p>
<p class="p1">state, or of the nation, holding some high office under the</p>
<p class="p1">government—the mistress, at home upon the plantation, is the main-spring</p>
<p class="p1">of all its business—superintending—not only the house and house-maids,</p>
<p class="p1">with their multifarious cares and avocations, such as a city housewife</p>
<p class="p1">cannot conceive of, but managing the plantation also—keeping the</p>
<p class="p1">overseer to his duty, adjudging equitably all difficulties that may</p>
<p class="p1">arise between him and the slaves under his charge—looking over all the</p>
<p class="p1">numerous accounts, paying debts, and, when necessary, retrenching</p>
<p class="p1">expenses. Now the Clifton plantation had been singularly unfortunate in</p>
<p class="p1">a series of inefficient mistresses, even before it fell in regular</p>
<p class="p1">succession to the present Mr. Clifton. And after that, affairs were</p>
<p class="p1">worse than ever. His first wife, the haughty Miss Gower, the mother of</p>
<p class="p1">Carolyn, was far too great a lady to look after a housekeeper and</p>
<p class="p1">overseer, and her successors had been all young girls, very worthless,</p>
<p class="p1">except as pets and playthings, and who had, besides, to be indulged</p>
<p class="p1">every year with their winters in Richmond, or in Washington—a two-fold</p>
<p class="p1">evil, as it took the master from his plantation and men, and the</p>
<p class="p1">mistress from her house and maids, and laid them, besides, under the</p>
<p class="p1">heavy expense of city hotel living, dressing, dinner-giving, theatres,</p>
<p class="p1">balls, concerts, etc. Once in awhile, as a bridal treat, or at the</p>
<p class="p1">successive “coming out” of daughters, a winter in the metropolis may be</p>
<p class="p1">well enough. But when continued year after year, through a lifetime, to</p>
<p class="p1">the total neglect of the plantation, the revenues of no ordinary estate</p>
<p class="p1">will hold out. So it followed, that as the master and mistress ceased to</p>
<p class="p1">look after the overseer and the housekeeper, the overseer and</p>
<p class="p1">housekeeper ceased to look after the men and maids, and the men and</p>
<p class="p1">maids grew careless and indolent in the performance of their duties.</p>
<p class="p1">Thus, as the expenses rose, the income fell. And thus, at the present</p>
<p class="p1">time, old Mr. Clifton was almost irredeemably in debt, and all the</p>
<p class="p1">Clifton property, except the land, mortgaged to its full value. The</p>
<p class="p1">mortgage might foreclose at any instant. And at this present moment, the</p>
<p class="p1">poor old master of great Clifton had not the ready money to pay his</p>
<p class="p1">harvest hands. The extent of his liabilities was, however, so little</p>
<p class="p1">known in the neighborhood, that his credit was still good, and almost</p>
<p class="p1">high—and the estate of White Cliffs was still considered as one of the</p>
<p class="p1">most prosperous in the county, and the owners still held as very</p>
<p class="p1">enviable people. While old Mr. Clifton sat pondering most dismally over</p>
<p class="p1">his impracticable accounts, the study door was suddenly thrown open, and</p>
<p class="p1">Miss Clifton entered, in great excitement, and threw herself into a</p>
<p class="p1">chair before her father, exclaiming—</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Father, I have been insulted!”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">The old man, never indifferent to his children’s cry—ever ready in the</p>
<p class="p1">midst of his own real cares, to hear and sympathize even with their</p>
<p class="p1">fantastic griefs—looked up from his papers in perplexity, inquiring—</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“What is it? What did you say, my child?”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“I have been insulted!—outraged, sir!”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">The old man gazed at her in surprise, repeating—</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“‘Insulted, outraged!’”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Yes, sir! contemned, despised, scorned, insulted, outraged,</p>
<p class="p1">_rejected_!”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">The old man placed his hands upon the arms of the chair and gazed in</p>
<p class="p1">astonishment, exclaiming—</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“‘Insulted!—outraged!’ Whom? You, my daughter Miss Clifton!</p>
<p class="p1">_Impossible._”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Yes, sir! me, your daughter—Carolyn Clifton!”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Who has presumed—who has dared—?”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Captain Clifton, sir, ‘has dared!’” replied the indignant beauty,</p>
<p class="p1">rising in her excitement.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">The old gentleman stared at her in blank wonder for a minute, and</p>
<p class="p1">then—taking her hand—</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Sit down—sit down—sit down—sit down,” he kept repeating, “and tell me</p>
<p class="p1">all about it.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Carolyn drank a glass of ice water that stood near her on the table, and</p>
<p class="p1">then, in a cooler manner, told her father exactly what had passed, and</p>
<p class="p1">how it had finally ended.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">The old gentleman scratched his snow-white head in vexation and</p>
<p class="p1">perplexity, but the winter bloom of his broad, rosy face, was neither</p>
<p class="p1">heightened nor lowered at the hearing of the tale. He did not by any</p>
<p class="p1">means display the indignation the offended beauty had expected.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Well, sir!” at last she said, rather haughtily, “what do you say to</p>
<p class="p1">this?”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">He put his arm fondly around her waist, and drew her to him, saying,</p>
<p class="p1">caressingly—</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“You’re a fool, Carolyn! A vain, jealous little fool, that’s all! Nay,</p>
<p class="p1">now!—no airs with your old father! According to your own showing, it has</p>
<p class="p1">been Archer that has been ‘contemned, despised, scorned, insulted,</p>
<p class="p1">outraged, rejected!’ and the rest of it—and upon no just grounds,</p>
<p class="p1">either! as I can easily prove to you. I am very much mortified—deeply</p>
<p class="p1">humbled, indeed, to hear that my daughter, a highborn young maiden,</p>
<p class="p1">should have forgotten her feminine pride and delicacy, and approached</p>
<p class="p1">her lover with an intimacy with a mountain-girl—a race of women, with</p>
<p class="p1">very few exceptions so low and wretched, that a young lady should ignore</p>
<p class="p1">their very existence. Oh, my conscience, Carolyn! why do you not cover</p>
<p class="p1">your face, and die with humiliation? I do not wonder a man of such high</p>
<p class="p1">honor and delicate sensibility as Archer Clifton, should have been</p>
<p class="p1">shocked and disgusted. Nay, my child!—no airs with me! No tossing of the</p>
<p class="p1">head, and curling of the lip with me! I am your father. You must listen</p>
<p class="p1">to me. You have done Archer the most outrageous injustice. And your</p>
<p class="p1">jealousy is as ridiculous as it is indelicate. In the first place, this</p>
<p class="p1">girl, though brought up on the mountain, comes of respectable, if humble</p>
<p class="p1">parentage, and possesses, by all accounts, a higher toned moral and</p>
<p class="p1">intellectual nature than most young _ladies_ are endowed with. She is as</p>
<p class="p1">far removed from vice as my own Carolyn! In the second place, she is the</p>
<p class="p1">protégé of _Mrs._ Clifton, as well as of Captain Clifton, and enjoys</p>
<p class="p1">that excellent lady’s esteem and friendship, spending half of every day</p>
<p class="p1">in her company, except when visitors are at the house. In the third and</p>
<p class="p1">last place, she is not a beautiful woman, but an ugly child—being</p>
<p class="p1">scarcely fourteen years of age, and having the ugliest face I ever saw</p>
<p class="p1">in my life—at least _I_ think so, though Mrs. Clifton says it is a noble</p>
<p class="p1">face. It has large features, and is full of strength and expression,</p>
<p class="p1">like a boy’s. There, now, that’s all! Now! what do you think of</p>
<p class="p1">yourself?”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">During this short explanation, Carolyn’s beautiful countenance had</p>
<p class="p1">changed expression as rapidly and as variously as during the lay of the</p>
<p class="p1">minstrel the harp changes and varies its notes. At its close she dropped</p>
<p class="p1">down by the side of the old man, and throwing her arms and her head upon</p>
<p class="p1">his knees, in utter weakness and dejection, sobbed—</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Father! how shall I _ever_ be forgiven?”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">He raised her to his knee, and putting his arm around her waist, drew</p>
<p class="p1">her head upon his bosom, and said—</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“It is an ugly lover’s quarrel, certainly, my love! And Archer Clifton</p>
<p class="p1">is as proud as you are! But it must be made up! It must be made up! A</p>
<p class="p1">very ugly quarrel, indeed. And on the eve of your marriage, too! But it</p>
<p class="p1">must be made up! It must be made up! Ah, doubtless he will be over</p>
<p class="p1">to-morrow night! He feels as bad as you do, I’ll warrant he does! I’ll</p>
<p class="p1">warrant he does! _I_ should, I know, if I were he!”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Ah, father! no he does not! He was in the right! I was in the wrong!”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Yes! you were wrong, Carry! And I hope it will be a lesson to you! But</p>
<p class="p1">that makes no difference in _his_ feelings, not a whit! He suffers as</p>
<p class="p1">much as you do! Why, when I have a difficulty with my poor little pet,</p>
<p class="p1">Georgia, if she is ever so wrong, and I ever so right, I am nevertheless</p>
<p class="p1">the most miserable man alive!”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Ah, father, but there is a great difference—I am not Archer’s pet, but</p>
<p class="p1">was to be his consort. We—Archer and myself, are nearly equal in</p>
<p class="p1">station, ay, education, disposition, and so are more responsible for our</p>
<p class="p1">conduct towards each other!” sighed Carolyn, dropping her head</p>
<p class="p1">dejectedly upon his bosom.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Oh, well! now if you are so full of doubts and fears! it is but ten</p>
<p class="p1">o’clock! I will mount my horse, and ride up to Hardbargain, and knock</p>
<p class="p1">the young gentleman up—I doubt if he is asleep!—and bring him back here,</p>
<p class="p1">to-night!”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Not for the world! Not for ten thousand worlds!” exclaimed the proud</p>
<p class="p1">girl, vehemently.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Ah, then I don’t know what to do with you—go to bed, and try to sleep,</p>
<p class="p1">and if you can’t do that, ring for the housekeeper, and make her give</p>
<p class="p1">you some of her nostrums, to put you to sleep! And go into a state of</p>
<p class="p1">non-existence, that shall obliterate the time between this and to-morrow</p>
<p class="p1">morning. And to-morrow, I’ll warrant Archer will be here to breakfast</p>
<p class="p1">with us, and to beg _your_ pardon for the sins that _you_ committed! for</p>
<p class="p1">that’s the end of all lovers’ quarrels! No matter who’s right and who’s</p>
<p class="p1">wrong—who’s sinned against, and who’s sinning, the gentleman has to do</p>
<p class="p1">the penance! There! kiss me, and be off with you!—and hark ye, Carolyn!</p>
<p class="p1">don’t forget to kneel down and pray Heaven to give you the grace of a</p>
<p class="p1">meeker temper!”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Carolyn Clifton went to her room and retired to bed, to heat her pillow</p>
<p class="p1">with her feverish head, to wet it with her hot tears—to sigh, and groan,</p>
<p class="p1">and toss, and sob all night. This bitter, bitter quarrel, was the first</p>
<p class="p1">trouble the girl had ever had in all her favored life. And she was</p>
<p class="p1">impatient with it, indignant at it. She was angry with herself for her</p>
<p class="p1">injustice and indelicacy; angry with Clifton for not forcing upon her</p>
<p class="p1">the explanation she would not consent to receive, but which, had she</p>
<p class="p1">been forced to hear, would have arrested the quarrel, and saved this</p>
<p class="p1">cruel suffering; angry at the tedious night, that lingered so long,</p>
<p class="p1">keeping her in agonizing suspense; angry at the morning, that delayed</p>
<p class="p1">its coming, and bringing her the peace and joy of a reconciliation. And</p>
<p class="p1">so she tossed, and groaned, and suffered, like one in high fever, while</p>
<p class="p1">the long, long night was slowly, slowly passing away.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">                  </span>* <span class="Apple-converted-space">      </span>* <span class="Apple-converted-space">      </span>* <span class="Apple-converted-space">      </span>* <span class="Apple-converted-space">      </span>*</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">In the meantime Captain Clifton had ridden away, not so angry as</p>
<p class="p1">shocked, repulsed and alienated by the unprecedented behaviour of his</p>
<p class="p1">lady-love. He disliked all demonstrations of emotion, and detested all</p>
<p class="p1">exhibitions of evil passion in a woman. It was the high-bred delicacy</p>
<p class="p1">and refinement—the queenly placidity—the cool reserve and stately</p>
<p class="p1">dignity of Carolyn Clifton, that had attracted his first admiration. And</p>
<p class="p1">though he sometimes gallantly complained of her cruelty, he would not</p>
<p class="p1">have had her manner one degree warmer. But now this fair, cool, peerless</p>
<p class="p1">queen o’er herself and her emotions, had yielded to passions that might</p>
<p class="p1">govern a serving-maid—to suspicion, jealousy, and fierce anger—had</p>
<p class="p1">descended to virulent, vituperative abuse! And, henceforth, she was</p>
<p class="p1">discrowned, and degraded from her pride of place.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">He arrived at Hardbargain—gave his horse in charge of a servant, and</p>
<p class="p1">entered the house.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">The candles were just lighted in the parlor, and Mrs. Clifton and her</p>
<p class="p1">favorite Kate sat sewing by the work-stand. As he entered, Kate arose as</p>
<p class="p1">usual with the intention of withdrawing, but he signed to her with his</p>
<p class="p1">hand, and said in a tone of command—</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“No—stay, Catherine, and once for all give up that habit of retiring as</p>
<p class="p1">soon as myself, or any other visitor enters.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">The young girl returned to her seat and resumed her work. Then with a</p>
<p class="p1">sort of spirit of persecution upon him, as one would think, he went to</p>
<p class="p1">the maiden and inquired, impatiently—</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“_Why_ do you always do that? _Why_ do you always rise and leave as soon</p>
<p class="p1">as any one enters the room?”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">She glanced up at him with those large, shy eyes, and instantly veiled</p>
<p class="p1">them again, while the blush deepened on her cheek. Her heart—her</p>
<p class="p1">disobedient, rebellious heart, that would not be calm when she bade</p>
<p class="p1">it—was beating fast against her bosom, as it ever beat, when he looked</p>
<p class="p1">at her, or spoke to her. To have saved her soul alive, she could not</p>
<p class="p1">have put her motive into words, and told him that she ever feared her</p>
<p class="p1">society, or even her presence, might not be as acceptable to Mrs.</p>
<p class="p1">Clifton’s visitors as it was to that kind lady herself. She only bowed</p>
<p class="p1">her head and blushed the deeper that she could not answer, and yet</p>
<p class="p1">deeper still, that she felt him gazing on her. He _was_ gazing on</p>
<p class="p1">her!—gazing down on that beautiful, dark auburn hair, rippling and</p>
<p class="p1">glittering under the light of the lamp—on that broad monarchal forehead,</p>
<p class="p1">on those even eyebrows and long eyelashes, dropping fine shadows on the</p>
<p class="p1">glowing cheek—yes! gazing and thinking of Major Cabell’s enthusiastic</p>
<p class="p1">admiration, and wondering why all the world did not agree with him in</p>
<p class="p1">thinking that countenance grandly beautiful! Yet even while admiring her</p>
<p class="p1">so much, he spoke angrily, and said—</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Catherine! You have a second habit even worse than the first! Lately</p>
<p class="p1">you have taken up the practice of not replying to me when I ask you a</p>
<p class="p1">question—and when you are obliged to raise your eyes to mine, you drop</p>
<p class="p1">them instantly as if mine burnt them. Now I have always disliked and</p>
<p class="p1">suspected eyes that cannot look freely into _other_ eyes!”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">At this the very forehead of the girl burned with a crimson flush.</p>
<p class="p1">Clifton took hold of her hand, which fluttered in his own like a</p>
<p class="p1">frightened bird, and said, in a kinder tone—</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Come, my child! see now if you can look me honestly in the face, and</p>
<p class="p1">tell me why you will not talk to me?”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">But Kate’s distress became so great that Mrs. Clifton interposed, and</p>
<p class="p1">said—</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“_Do_, Archer, leave her alone! It does seem to me, son, that you take a</p>
<p class="p1">malicious pleasure in tormenting that poor girl because she is so shy!</p>
<p class="p1">Don’t mind him, Kate! He has been a tease ever since he was a boy, when</p>
<p class="p1">he used to pull the ears of kittens and puppy dogs. Take up your work,</p>
<p class="p1">child, and hurry on with it. And you, Archer! I am as much surprised as</p>
<p class="p1">pleased to see you back here to-night. To what am I indebted for the</p>
<p class="p1">pleasure?”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“My dear mother, I will tell you after awhile—let me be quiet now a</p>
<p class="p1">little time.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">And Mrs. Clifton looked up in surprise, and noticed, for the first time,</p>
<p class="p1">how deeply troubled was Archer Clifton’s face. After watching him a few</p>
<p class="p1">minutes as he sat and watched Kate, she said, suddenly—</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Oh! I have a letter for you—arrived by the afternoon mail. Henry</p>
<p class="p1">brought it from the post-office this evening after you left. Perhaps it</p>
<p class="p1">was in quest of that you came, and its contents may dispel your</p>
<p class="p1">uneasiness,” and rising, the lady went to the card rack, hanging above</p>
<p class="p1">the mantle-piece, and brought him a letter, which he tore open and read</p>
<p class="p1">hastily. Then starting up, he exclaimed, “Good! Good! Most excellent,</p>
<p class="p1">most opportune!”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“What is it, my dear Archer? I am very glad it gives you such</p>
<p class="p1">satisfaction, at any rate! What is it?”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“An order from head-quarters to join my regiment immediately, to take</p>
<p class="p1">command of a detachment to march within ten days for the Indian</p>
<p class="p1">frontier—to put down an insurrection there!”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“No!” exclaimed the lady, in amazement.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Yes, indeed, my good mother!” replied Archer Clifton, exultingly.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“_No!_ You astonish me! Ordered upon active duty—upon distant and</p>
<p class="p1">dangerous service at the very time you are about to be married! Call you</p>
<p class="p1">that opportune—fortunate? I call it most _in_opportune, _un_fortunate!”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Ah! madam, you do not know! What, and if my marriage were already</p>
<p class="p1">broken off! Is it not lucky—I mean providential, that I can join my</p>
<p class="p1">regiment immediately, and depart for a distant scene, and active</p>
<p class="p1">service, in which I may forget the sorrow and the humiliation!”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Your marriage broken off? What? Now, at the last moment? A marriage</p>
<p class="p1">that has been looked forward to for so many years? To be broken off when</p>
<p class="p1">every thing is ready! Impossible, it cannot be!”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“I assure you upon my word, madam, it is but too true!”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Why—what—_do_ you tell me?” exclaimed the lady, in increasing</p>
<p class="p1">astonishment. “When did it happen? What caused it? Had Mr. Clifton</p>
<p class="p1">anything to do with it?”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“It happened this evening after my return to Clifton. Mr. Clifton had</p>
<p class="p1">nothing whatever to do with it—not having reached home at the time it</p>
<p class="p1">occurred. It was occasioned by a most humiliating quarrel between myself</p>
<p class="p1">and Miss Clifton!”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Oh, a quarrel! A lovers’ quarrel! That is nothing! Though, in truth, it</p>
<p class="p1">surprises me that the calm, proud Carolyn should descend to such a</p>
<p class="p1">thing, as it does that my own son should deign to take a part in it. But</p>
<p class="p1">it is really nothing! Such things occur in almost every courtship!”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“And those who quarrel in courtship should never venture upon</p>
<p class="p1">matrimony.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Ah! that is an inhuman, unfaithful sentiment, my son! Young people are</p>
<p class="p1">like other young natures, petulant, vain, irascible, exacting—but life</p>
<p class="p1">trains them into modesty, sobriety, forbearance. For this quarrel,</p>
<p class="p1">Archer, it must be adjusted! It shall be to-morrow morning!”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“No, madam, it shall not! This quarrel is irreconcilable, believe me!”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Pooh, pooh! _What! with Carolyn?_ Nonsense!”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Mother! you shall judge! She has descended from her high place of</p>
<p class="p1">maidenly pride and delicacy, and betraying the most revolting phases of</p>
<p class="p1">suspicion, jealousy and fierce anger she has charged me with infidelity,</p>
<p class="p1">base treachery and vice!”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Dreadful! dreadful! as all angry words and acts ever are! _But not</p>
<p class="p1">unpardonable!_ Spoken in the frenzy of passion—they will be retracted</p>
<p class="p1">to-morrow! And then you must be reconciled. Things must go on as they</p>
<p class="p1">have been planned. There must be no discreditable exposure of this</p>
<p class="p1">affray. The marriage must take place, as proposed, to-morrow evening.</p>
<p class="p1">Then, if you _must_ join your regiment, why it will be easily</p>
<p class="p1">_understood_ that you must. And there will be no reproach under those</p>
<p class="p1">circumstances in leaving your newly wedded bride under her father’s</p>
<p class="p1">protection!”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Impossible, madam! Miss Clifton has to-night exhibited her character</p>
<p class="p1">and disposition in such revolting colors, that I can never, never take</p>
<p class="p1">her to my bosom!”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“You are angry now, Archer! You will think better of it! I trust in</p>
<p class="p1">Heaven you may do so before there is an exposure. Think what will be the</p>
<p class="p1">astonishment of the wedding-company who will assemble to-morrow</p>
<p class="p1">evening—the mortification of the family at Clifton, and worse than all,</p>
<p class="p1">the scandal! the nine days wonder!”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“I thought my dear mother had too strong a mind to fear these bugbears</p>
<p class="p1">of the little, when a just occasion for meeting and braving them</p>
<p class="p1">occurs.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“But I do not consider this an adequate occasion. That this quarrel will</p>
<p class="p1">be finally adjusted, I firmly believe. And I think it a pity and a shame</p>
<p class="p1">that to-morrow evening, three hundred guests should be disappointed and</p>
<p class="p1">dispersed, to spread a subject of speculation and scandal all over the</p>
<p class="p1">country. And this merely because you will yet a little longer indulge</p>
<p class="p1">your anger!”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“I am not angry, mother. If I were only angry I should let the marriage</p>
<p class="p1">go on, if Miss Clifton thought proper to do so, for I should know that</p>
<p class="p1">my anger would pass away. No, I am not angry, mother, but shocked,</p>
<p class="p1">repulsed, and totally estranged. I could no more marry Miss Clifton now,</p>
<p class="p1">than I could take any other loathed object to my bosom! The idea makes</p>
<p class="p1">me shudder!”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Still I affirm that all this is intense anger, nothing else, and that</p>
<p class="p1">there will come a reaction. Why in anger, Archer, the object is as much</p>
<p class="p1">loathed as in love it is desired—but _that_ is temporary, and _this_, I</p>
<p class="p1">hope, you will find permanent. I hope, at bottom, you respect Carolyn?</p>
<p class="p1">_I esteem_ her. She has been a spoiled child, but has so many</p>
<p class="p1">undeveloped good qualities, that she only wants the discipline of a</p>
<p class="p1">little affection to make her a very excellent woman. I shall say no more</p>
<p class="p1">about this affair to-night, but wait to see what disposition I shall</p>
<p class="p1">find you in to-morrow!”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">At this moment there was a knock at the door, and instantly afterwards</p>
<p class="p1">Henny came in and informed her mistress that Mr. Kavanagh had come to</p>
<p class="p1">take his sister home.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Ask Mr. Kavanagh to sit down in the hall. Put up your sewing,</p>
<p class="p1">Catherine, my dear!” said the lady.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Catherine arose to fold up her work, while Captain Clifton looked very</p>
<p class="p1">much as if he would like to stop her again.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Does she not remain with you at night, madam?”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Certainly not—her brother always comes for her at bedtime.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“How early does she come in the morning?”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“She never comes in the morning. Catherine has her own domestic affairs</p>
<p class="p1">to attend to during the forenoon. She never gets here till late in the</p>
<p class="p1">afternoon.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Then I shall not see her to-morrow—not see her again for many</p>
<p class="p1">months—perhaps _never_ see her again! Come here, Catherine!”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Catherine came to his side, and stood, as usual, with her eyes fixed</p>
<p class="p1">upon the ground, and her cheek painfully flushed. He took her hand and</p>
<p class="p1">pressed it in his own, while he said—</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Catherine! you have heard all that passed between myself and Mrs.</p>
<p class="p1">Clifton, this evening?”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">A quick, short, but not ungraceful nod was all her answer.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“And you know that I am going away on a distant and dangerous service; I</p>
<p class="p1">leave here very early in the morning—I may never come back, Catherine,”</p>
<p class="p1">he said, slowly, looking at her steadily.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Her hand in his grew cold—her cheek paled—her heart stopped still as</p>
<p class="p1">death—but no word did she speak in reply.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Catherine! before I go, I intend to give you a command—do you hear me?”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">A spasmodic nod was her reply.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“I may be gone many years. In the meanwhile you will grow up to</p>
<p class="p1">womanhood, Catherine; do not have any lovers—_beaux_—as young girls call</p>
<p class="p1">them, while I am away—and above all things, do not choose a husband</p>
<p class="p1">without first consulting me through my mother.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Not knowing what to reply to this, Catherine remained perfectly silent.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Will you obey me in this, girl?” he asked, rather impatiently.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">A low, earnest choking “Yes sir,” was her answer.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Kiss me, then! for I may never return,” said Archer Clifton, folding</p>
<p class="p1">her for one moment to his bosom, and pressing a kiss upon her full lips.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">But her lips grew cold at the touch—her face paled and fell away from</p>
<p class="p1">his bosom—her form drooped and sank back over his arm, where she lay</p>
<p class="p1">like one dead, in a swoon.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Surprised, alarmed, Clifton raised her in both arms, and hastened to the</p>
<p class="p1">lounge, where he laid her, calling to his mother. The lady came forward</p>
<p class="p1">without any trepidation, and bringing a bottle of Hungary water, began</p>
<p class="p1">to chafe her temples and face, and finally gave that task to Clifton,</p>
<p class="p1">while she herself loosened Kate’s dress.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“What could have been the cause of this, mother? Is she subject to these</p>
<p class="p1">attacks?”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“I never knew her to faint before, though I have seen her under very</p>
<p class="p1">trying circumstances with that old man, her grandfather.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“What could have occasioned it?”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Why, the sudden news of your going away on dangerous service, of</p>
<p class="p1">course,” said Mrs. Clifton, as she resumed the bottle, and continued to</p>
<p class="p1">chafe the girl’s face and hands. “The child loves you, Archer; she has a</p>
<p class="p1">very grateful, affectionate heart, and very strong feelings. She loves</p>
<p class="p1">us both. And when you bade her good-bye, for a long and perilous</p>
<p class="p1">absence, is it strange she should have been overcome? When _soldiers_</p>
<p class="p1">talk of danger, _children_ may be forgiven for being frightened. Do go</p>
<p class="p1">and tell Kavanagh that Kate must remain here to-night, and dismiss him.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">He went, and before he came back again, Kate, with a long drawn sigh,</p>
<p class="p1">had opened her eyes and recovered.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“You must raise her, and take her up stairs, my dear Archer. She must</p>
<p class="p1">suffer no more agitation to-night,” said Mrs. Clifton.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">And he lifted the form of Catherine, and took her up stairs, while his</p>
<p class="p1">mother called Henny. When they had laid the young girl on a bed, and</p>
<p class="p1">left her to the care of Henny, and had returned to the parlor</p>
<p class="p1">again—Captain Clifton said—</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Mother! take care of that girl! She has been the innocent, unconscious</p>
<p class="p1">cause of my trouble to-day, but I cannot feel dislike or even</p>
<p class="p1">indifference towards her. Take care of that humble maiden, mother, as if</p>
<p class="p1">she were your daughter and my sister. Don’t let any rustic beaux come</p>
<p class="p1">near her, mother. I cannot endure the idea of her marrying, or even</p>
<p class="p1">being wooed by any low, miserable fellow of her brother’s grade. And do</p>
<p class="p1">not permit any young gentleman of the neighborhood to trifle with her</p>
<p class="p1">heart, or endanger her good name. You know how easily, even without her</p>
<p class="p1">fault, that sole possession of a poor maiden is lost. The thought that</p>
<p class="p1">such an unmerited misfortune should befall Kate, exasperates me beyond</p>
<p class="p1">measure, and I feel like quarreling with the whole order of society!”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“What, you! the proud conservator of rank! Truly Archer, one would think</p>
<p class="p1">Carolyn _had some little ground_ of complaint!” said the lady, with her</p>
<p class="p1">little, low, half dignified, half jolly laugh.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“This from _you_ mother!” exclaimed Archer Clifton, reproachfully. “I</p>
<p class="p1">thought you knew me better. You _do_ know me better! But I must have</p>
<p class="p1">some hand in this girl’s good fortune.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Mrs. Clifton, who was walking about the room, quietly setting things in</p>
<p class="p1">order for the night, made no reply, but only smiled. And soon after she</p>
<p class="p1">lighted a night lamp, and placing it in the hand of her son, bade him</p>
<p class="p1">good-night, and retired to her chamber. Captain Clifton remained pacing</p>
<p class="p1">up and down the room, in troubled thought, some time after she had left,</p>
<p class="p1">before seeking his own couch.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>

<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Morning came at length. Carolyn Clifton arose unrefreshed, weak, dizzy</p>
<p class="p1">and sick. This was the first night’s rest she had ever lost in her life.</p>
<p class="p1">And on looking in the glass—habitually the first thing the beauty ever</p>
<p class="p1">did after rising—she was shocked to see what havoc one night’s evil</p>
<p class="p1">passions had made in her appearance. What a fright she had become! How</p>
<p class="p1">pale her cheeks, how dragged the muscles, how red, dim, and sunken her</p>
<p class="p1">eyes! And this upon her wedding-day—and when she had a quarrel to make</p>
<p class="p1">up with her intended husband, too! When, in fine, every circumstance</p>
<p class="p1">pressingly demanded that she should appear in the highest beauty. Would</p>
<p class="p1">Archer Clifton—would that fastidious, artistic worshiper of the</p>
<p class="p1">beautiful—feel inclined to a reconciliation with such a spectre as</p>
<p class="p1">herself, she mentally inquired, as she gazed wonderingly, deploringly,</p>
<p class="p1">upon her haggard face? Carolyn was vain and proud and scornful—so vain</p>
<p class="p1">and proud and scornful that she did not know—could not imagine that that</p>
<p class="p1">very haggard face—haggard with sorrow for the estrangement and the</p>
<p class="p1">separation, would be a stronger appeal, make a deeper impression upon</p>
<p class="p1">the heart of her lover, than all the glory of her beauty had ever done.</p>
<p class="p1">And thus vanity, pride and scorn punish their subject, not only by</p>
<p class="p1">depriving her of very much respect and affection she would otherwise</p>
<p class="p1">have, but by making her insensible of that love and esteem that really</p>
<p class="p1">does surround her.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Carolyn at length rang for her woman. And after some little delay she</p>
<p class="p1">came in, evidently just aroused up out of her sleep, and wondering that</p>
<p class="p1">her young mistress should summon her before sunrise. But as soon as she</p>
<p class="p1">saw her lady, her wonder gave way to alarm, and she exclaimed—</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“My good gracious alive, Miss Carolyn! What’s der matter, honey?”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Has——_any one_ arrived this morning, Aunt Darky?” inquired Miss</p>
<p class="p1">Clifton, without noticing the old woman’s alarm.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“No, chile, sure not! Who should ribe at dis onlikely hour ob de mornin?</p>
<p class="p1">Ledst it war de doctor. Has you sent for de doctor, honey? But Lord,</p>
<p class="p1">indeed, chile, you better lay down agin. Don’t keep on standin’ dere</p>
<p class="p1">holdin’ up your hair, weak as you looks, an’ I’ll run an’ see!”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Aunt Darky, I am not ill. I have had a bad night’s rest—that’s all.</p>
<p class="p1">Go—and—”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“A bad night’s res’, an’ like enough, honey! I had a _berry_ bad night’s</p>
<p class="p1">res’ de night afore, me an’ Old Nick took up ’long o’ each oder! ’Deed</p>
<p class="p1">chile, I was sort o’ scared an’ sorter happy, ’cause I _was_ scared! An’</p>
<p class="p1">deed, chile, ‘tween so many con_try_dictions, I could’n onderstan’</p>
<p class="p1">myself and kept awake all night! Lord, honey, it’s nat’ral! We’s all</p>
<p class="p1">alike, ’cept ’tis de collor, an’ dat’s only outside show, skin deep. But</p>
<p class="p1">bless you, honey, that wan’t nothin’ to the night ’resses I’se lost</p>
<p class="p1">since dat, with long o’ cryin’ babies an’ teethin’ babies, an’ sick</p>
<p class="p1">chillun, an’ ole man Nick comin’ home drunk ebery time ole Marse give</p>
<p class="p1">him any holyday money to spen’ on hisself! Now praise be de Lor’, de</p>
<p class="p1">chillun’s all raise’ an’ married an’ settle’ off, an’ I’m a free ‘oman!</p>
<p class="p1">An’ I tell my galls how I ain’ gwine be bother’ long o’ _der_ chillun,</p>
<p class="p1">now in my ole days!”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Aunt Darky,” said Miss Clifton, feeling in no way flattered by the</p>
<p class="p1">parallel, “go and get my bath ready, and have a cup of strong coffee</p>
<p class="p1">brought the instant I leave it.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Yes, honey—an’ hadn’t de baff’s water better have de air tuk off o’ it,</p>
<p class="p1">as you’se not so strong dis mornin’?”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Yes, yes—what makes you trouble me by questions? You ought to know what</p>
<p class="p1">is proper to be done.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“An’ so I allus does know, honey—ony when I does my mos’ properess’, you</p>
<p class="p1">doesn’n alluz’ see it into dat light an you fines fau’rt long o’ me,”</p>
<p class="p1">said the old body, as she left the room.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">When Miss Clifton had left her warm bath, and had partaken of the rich</p>
<p class="p1">strong coffee—strong as the essence of coffee, and made rich and thick</p>
<p class="p1">by being half cream and sugar, and brought to her in a tiny porcelain</p>
<p class="p1">cup, she felt sufficiently refreshed to be able, with the assistance of</p>
<p class="p1">her woman, to make her morning toilet.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">When she had finished dressing it was still very early, and two hours</p>
<p class="p1">remained before breakfast—but she left her room, and met her father, who</p>
<p class="p1">was an early riser, in the upper hall.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">He came forward and kissed her. Then held both her hands, and looked in</p>
<p class="p1">her face, exclaiming—“What! pale, my child? Oh, tut! tut! tut! tut! tut!</p>
<p class="p1">That’s _all_ wrong! All wrong!”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Father! has he come yet?”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“No, no—it’s quite early yet! He’ll be here anon! You should not have</p>
<p class="p1">risen these two hours!”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Father, I could not sleep! I could not even lie in bed!”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Oh, pooh! pooh! pooh! All folly! All nonsense! Go back and rest.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Father, I cannot! My words to him were so wrong! so bitter! so</p>
<p class="p1">insulting! I feel them to have been such, and I can never rest until I</p>
<p class="p1">have told him so!” said Carolyn, dropping her head upon the only bosom</p>
<p class="p1">to which her haughty heart could bear to confide its sorrow and its</p>
<p class="p1">repentance.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Well, so you were wrong, very wrong! It will teach you a lesson that</p>
<p class="p1">will benefit you for the future. And for the present it will blow over.</p>
<p class="p1">There, there, there—if you can’t be still, go and amuse yourself by</p>
<p class="p1">making me a nice mint-julep! I want it before I go out in the fields—the</p>
<p class="p1">morning air on my empty stomach isn’t good for me.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">He then kissed Carolyn and let her go. As she left him, he saw to his</p>
<p class="p1">surprise Frank Fairfax emerge from his chamber, with a portmanteau in</p>
<p class="p1">his hand. Frank immediately set it down, and advancing, said—</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Ah, sir! I was just about to seek you, to let you know that, to my</p>
<p class="p1">infinite regret, I must leave you to-day.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“To-day? You astound me! What is up now? You mustn’t go—you shan’t!”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Sir, I have received an order to join my regiment without delay!”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Oh-h-h, that’s bad! That’s bad! Devil fly away with military life!</p>
<p class="p1">That’s what was always hiking away Archer at the very time I wanted him</p>
<p class="p1">most. But no frantic hurry! You needn’t go to-day! You _mustn’t_. Why,</p>
<p class="p1">this is the wedding-day, you rascal!”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“I know it, sir! But, to my everlasting regret, I must forego the</p>
<p class="p1">pleasure of being present upon that occasion. My order is a peremptory</p>
<p class="p1">one, to join my regiment instantly.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Well, well! To-morrow’ll do! To-morrow’ll do! _One_ day cannot make so</p>
<p class="p1">much difference!”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“My dear sir, I surely need not tell you that soldiers should be ‘minute</p>
<p class="p1">men’ in their obedience. Besides, if I do not seize the opportunity of</p>
<p class="p1">meeting the Staunton stage as it passes through L—— to-night, I shall</p>
<p class="p1">have to wait three days for the next stage. So, you see—”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Yes, yes; I see! I am always called upon to see something I don’t want</p>
<p class="p1">to see! Ah! here comes the mint-julep! Did Miss Carolyn mix it?”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">This was addressed to the colored boy who brought a pint tumbler on a</p>
<p class="p1">little waiter.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Yez, zur,” said the boy.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Do you take julep in the morning, Frank? Try this. Another julep for</p>
<p class="p1">me, Nace!”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“No, no, I thank you, sir! I never do. I wish you good-morning till</p>
<p class="p1">breakfast time,” said Frank, taking up his portmanteau, and going down</p>
<p class="p1">stairs.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Frank put his little burden down in the lower hall, and went into the</p>
<p class="p1">summer saloon, where he was sure, by the precedent of the last thirty</p>
<p class="p1">days, of finding Zuleime at the window, doing her sampler-work. Yes,</p>
<p class="p1">there she was, in her white muslin and coral, with her jet black hair</p>
<p class="p1">and damask cheeks! He went and sat down by her, (after saying</p>
<p class="p1">“Good-morning,”) and sat for some minutes in perfect silence, watching</p>
<p class="p1">Zuleime work the word Love, in crimson silk. At length—</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Whom do _you_ love best in the world, Zuleime?” he asked.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“How can you ask? Whom does _everybody_ love best?—‘her nain sell,’ as</p>
<p class="p1">the Welchman says, of course!” exclaimed the merry maiden.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Humph! Well, whom do you love the _next_ best to yourself?”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Why, let me see,” said the girl, pausing thoughtfully, with her needle</p>
<p class="p1">poised in her hand; “I think, that next to myself, I love—Zuleime</p>
<p class="p1">Clifton best of all the world!”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“I thought so! And I can lay my hand upon my heart, and say, that you</p>
<p class="p1">don’t love Zuleime Clifton a whit better than I do!—no, nor half so</p>
<p class="p1">well! I’ll throw down my gage on that, and fight it out to extremity!</p>
<p class="p1">Come!—What have you to say to that?” asked the young man, with all the</p>
<p class="p1">earnestness in his face and manner that his light words wanted—“say,</p>
<p class="p1">speak! What do you say to that?”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Why, that you are as foolish as Zuleime herself, in loving such a</p>
<p class="p1">little, out-of-the-way baggage, that is neither woman nor child, nor</p>
<p class="p1">good nor bad, nor any thing else in particular.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Well, at any rate, we both agree in loving and worshiping Zuleime,</p>
<p class="p1">however we may differ in our opinion of her—_I_, for instance, thinking</p>
<p class="p1">her a beautiful, joyous, delightful girl. So, it’s settled, isn’t it?”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“What is settled?”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Oh, you know, you tease!”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“I know the weather is settled, if you mean _that_!”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Pooh!”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“I _don’t_ know that the naval trouble with Great Britain is settled, if</p>
<p class="p1">you mean _that_!”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Pooh, pooh!”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“I know that the marriage dower of thirty thousand dollars is settled</p>
<p class="p1">upon Carolyn, if you mean that!”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Pooh, pooh, pooh!”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Well, I shall not try to guess again, lest you should say, ‘Pooh, pooh,</p>
<p class="p1">pooh, _pooh_!’—four times!”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Zuleime!” said the young man, earnestly, “I think, without presumption,</p>
<p class="p1">I may say that I know your disposition towards me. Zuleime, I wish that</p>
<p class="p1">we should pass all our lives together, side by side! I would like to</p>
<p class="p1">open my heart and bid you look into it and read for yourself. I hate to</p>
<p class="p1">say, ‘I love you,’ (though if you could look into my heart!) Oh, that</p>
<p class="p1">phrase, ‘I love you,’ Zuleime, is so fallen, is so prostituted, so</p>
<p class="p1">degraded from its high meaning—‘I love you’ so often means ‘I need your</p>
<p class="p1">wealth,’ ‘need your family influence,’ ‘I desire your delightful</p>
<p class="p1">beauty!’ Oh, Zuleime, dearest girl, how then shall I express my true,</p>
<p class="p1">sincere, earnest devotion to you?”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“You needn’t—I know you like me, Frank,” murmured Zuleime, very low. And</p>
<p class="p1">then she added, lower still—“But I am nothing but a wild school-girl,</p>
<p class="p1">and, seriously, I fear it isn’t right for me to listen to such words for</p>
<p class="p1">years to come yet. And I fear father might not like it, only that he</p>
<p class="p1">likes _you_ so very well.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">And Zuleime bent over her sampler, diligently, commencing the next word,</p>
<p class="p1">hope, in azure silk.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“I know it, Zuleime! Dear, candid girl, I know it all—all the seeming</p>
<p class="p1">error! But, Zuleime, I am going away to-day,” (she looked up in</p>
<p class="p1">surprise,) “and I may be gone for several years. When I come back I</p>
<p class="p1">shall certainly return a captain, if not probably a major, or possibly a</p>
<p class="p1">colonel. Before I go, I wish to have a fair understanding with yourself</p>
<p class="p1">and your father, so that I may go away with some feeling of security. I</p>
<p class="p1">want you both to promise that when I return you will give me your hand.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“You may speak to father, Frank. But I tell you frankly now, what I wish</p>
<p class="p1">you had heard before. It is this:—that I have been promised to my grim</p>
<p class="p1">cousin, Major Cabell, ever since I can remember anything. And till you</p>
<p class="p1">came, I have always, whenever I have anticipated the future at all,</p>
<p class="p1">looked forward to being his hum-drum wife, and living in a grim</p>
<p class="p1">three-story red brick, in a row, and opposite another row of stiff,</p>
<p class="p1">prison-like red brick houses, each one of which, taken singly, is more</p>
<p class="p1">dreary than all the rest. I didn’t like the prospect, Frank; but I</p>
<p class="p1">thought it was my fate, and the best father could do for me, and so I</p>
<p class="p1">thought of no other possibility but the grim red brick house in the city</p>
<p class="p1">and Major Cabell. Besides, father is so good a father, and so fond and</p>
<p class="p1">indulgent, that it seemed _too_ wicked to think of disappointing his</p>
<p class="p1">gentle wishes, that never take the form of commands. And so, Frank,</p>
<p class="p1">although whenever I would think of the grim brick house, with tall dark</p>
<p class="p1">chambers, and the narrow, stony, distracting street before it, and Major</p>
<p class="p1">Cabell, my heart would sink very heavy, and I would think, young as I</p>
<p class="p1">was, that there was scarcely any hope for me at all—yet, I would</p>
<p class="p1">recollect my dear good father wished it, and I would pluck up my spirits</p>
<p class="p1">and feel blithe as a bird again. It was all understood at the school</p>
<p class="p1">where I am getting finished, as they call it. And father left word that</p>
<p class="p1">Major Cabell should be admitted to visit me. So when I am there he comes</p>
<p class="p1">to visit me frequently, and takes me out riding, or driving, and to</p>
<p class="p1">concerts. And the girls whisper together, and say that I am engaged—”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Stop—stop—stop—stop! Pardon me, Zuleime! Pardon me, dear girl! But, I</p>
<p class="p1">am giddy—indeed, I am ill! Have you yourself promised to marry him?”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“No, surely not; and that is the reason why I consider myself in some</p>
<p class="p1">sort _free_—but of my duty to my good father. No, he has never even</p>
<p class="p1">asked me. He considers my father’s promise quite sufficient, and our</p>
<p class="p1">marriage quite a matter of course. And so I used to consider it, too.</p>
<p class="p1">These things are often done, Frank. These betrothals, I mean. Any one</p>
<p class="p1">might suppose the custom obsolete—having died in the dark ages. It is</p>
<p class="p1">not. It prevails here to a considerable extent. It is done to keep</p>
<p class="p1">family property together, or family interest closely cemented. And,</p>
<p class="p1">Frank, he has never courted me yet. You see he considers me a child</p>
<p class="p1">still. And so I am, compared to him, in years. And so I should be, in</p>
<p class="p1">all things, a child, but that the shadow of that grim brick house is</p>
<p class="p1">always falling on my heart!”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“And yet, with all this, you are a very, very merry maiden!”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Yes, so I am. I try to be! I keep a din up in my head to prevent me</p>
<p class="p1">hearing what my heart wants to say! Goodness! I can do nothing for the</p>
<p class="p1">poor thing, you know, and what’s the use of stopping to listen to its</p>
<p class="p1">cry?—_that_ would only encourage it to complain the more. Don’t look so</p>
<p class="p1">sorry, Frank! It is not all effort! It could not be, you know. I’m</p>
<p class="p1">naturally of a glad, elastic temper; and but for this drawback, Heaven</p>
<p class="p1">knows what I should be! the wildest, maddest, most harem-scarem, most</p>
<p class="p1">heels-over-head, skip-over-the-moon madcap that ever turned a quiet home</p>
<p class="p1">topsy-turvy, and drove a quiet family to distraction! The Bible</p>
<p class="p1">says,—‘God loveth whom He chasteneth, and scourgeth every son (and</p>
<p class="p1">daughter) whom He receiveth.’ Then I think, (I _do_ think, sometimes,</p>
<p class="p1">young and volatile as I am,) I think that every one whom God redeems has</p>
<p class="p1">_some_ sorrow, and that sorrow is always the precise one fitted to cure</p>
<p class="p1">their besetting sin! As the proud are still kept down by poverty and</p>
<p class="p1">oppression, the vain lose their charms, or the power of enhancing them,</p>
<p class="p1">etc., etc., etc., among all the erring whom God designs to set right.</p>
<p class="p1">And I, who am naturally so wild and thoughtless, must be sobered and</p>
<p class="p1">made thoughtful by the prospect of that prison before me!”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Zuleime, does this man love you?”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Frank, if I say he does not _hate_ me, it is the extent of all</p>
<p class="p1">favorable things I can say about the state of his mind towards me. No,</p>
<p class="p1">he does not love me. It is entirely a betrothal of convenience.</p>
<p class="p1">Sometimes I look forward to my future life in that great unknown city,</p>
<p class="p1">which I should dislike under any circumstances, and especially to pass</p>
<p class="p1">my whole life in, with one I do not like, and who does not like me, and</p>
<p class="p1">I _wonder_ how I shall contrive to exist,—_I_, who love to be in the</p>
<p class="p1">country, on this dear old homestead, with my fond old father and my</p>
<p class="p1">tender old nurse, and the colored folks who love me so well,—and where I</p>
<p class="p1">have so many occupations,—and, oh, my soul and body! I think how _shall_</p>
<p class="p1">I ever put life through in that packed up city! Sometimes I think—for I</p>
<p class="p1">_must_ have something to occupy my whole soul with—that I will be very</p>
<p class="p1">gay and worldly, and dress, and visit, and give balls, and go to balls,</p>
<p class="p1">and theatres; but then again I reflect that it would be wicked to spend</p>
<p class="p1">all one’s time and attention upon such things. And then I think I shall</p>
<p class="p1">try to grow serious enough to join a church, and that I will be a</p>
<p class="p1">leading member, and a Sunday School teacher, and a patroness of the</p>
<p class="p1">Bible Society, and of the Missionary Society, and a getter-up of new</p>
<p class="p1">kinds of benevolent associations, and Dorcas circles, and be a Committee</p>
<p class="p1">woman, and a distributor of tracts, and a collector of subscriptions,</p>
<p class="p1">etc. One _must_ do _something_ to fill up the long, long days; one</p>
<p class="p1">_must_ live _somehow_, and, upon the whole, I thought this latter plan</p>
<p class="p1">might do, as it would occupy me entirely, and is not so wicked as the</p>
<p class="p1">other.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Ah, I don’t know that, Zuleime! But, my dearest girl, cease all these</p>
<p class="p1">troubled thoughts about the future, unnatural to your age, and</p>
<p class="p1">unwholesome to yourself! This whole cloud must be swept away like a</p>
<p class="p1">cobweb. He doesn’t love you. You don’t love him. He has never asked you</p>
<p class="p1">to marry him. You have never promised to do so. It is a mere betrothal</p>
<p class="p1">of convenience, made by the parents of both for the purpose of keeping</p>
<p class="p1">family property together, and cementing family interests. Oh, it is all</p>
<p class="p1">wrong! And there is nothing in it! I will speak to your father. I will</p>
<p class="p1">enter the lists with this Major Cabell, as a competitor for your hand.</p>
<p class="p1">In all worldly circumstances, which are ever of the greatest value in a</p>
<p class="p1">Clifton’s estimation—in family, wealth and social position, I am his</p>
<p class="p1">peer. Besides, I wear my lady’s favor, which he does not! I will go to</p>
<p class="p1">your father now and tell him as much, shall I, Zuleime?”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">The young lady was busy threading her needle with golden yellow silk,</p>
<p class="p1">and did not answer. He repeated the question.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Yes,” murmured Zuleime, beginning to embroider the last word of the</p>
<p class="p1">trio,—Faith,—in sunbeam silk. No time was to be lost. He raised her hand</p>
<p class="p1">to his lips, and darted out upon the lawn to meet old Mr. Clifton, whom</p>
<p class="p1">he saw approaching the house.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“My dear sir!” exclaimed Mr. Fairfax, rather excitedly. “I have</p>
<p class="p1">something of the utmost importance to say to you. Will you take a turn</p>
<p class="p1">with me?”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“My dear sir!” repeated the old gentleman, smiling, “breakfast is ready!</p>
<p class="p1">Let’s go on to the house!”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“But my _dear_ sir! my business is urgent!”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“My _very_ dear sir! the coffee is getting cold!” said the old man,</p>
<p class="p1">laughing at Frank’s excitement.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Mr. Clifton,” said the young man, gravely and sadly, “immediately after</p>
<p class="p1">breakfast I must leave here. This, then, is the only opportunity I have</p>
<p class="p1">or shall have of communicating to you what is on my heart to say—and it</p>
<p class="p1">really _is_ on my _heart_.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Say on then, my dear boy! say on!” exclaimed the benevolent old</p>
<p class="p1">gentleman. But Frank, now that he had got leave to speak, was struck</p>
<p class="p1">dumb. He thought it was perfectly easy and simple to ask for Zuleime,</p>
<p class="p1">but now the request, like Macbeth’s amen, stuck in his throat. “Come,”</p>
<p class="p1">said the old gentleman, running his fat arm through Frank’s slender one,</p>
<p class="p1">“give me the support of your arm, for I am not so young and active as</p>
<p class="p1">you are, and let us take a little walk up the path towards Hardbargain.</p>
<p class="p1">Perhaps we may meet Archer, and bring him back with us to breakfast. He</p>
<p class="p1">is not at the _house_, is he?”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“No, sir,” said Frank, glad to recover the use of his tongue.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“We expect him here to breakfast. We shall probably meet him. Come!</p>
<p class="p1">Well, now! what is it?” he asked, as they turned their backs on the</p>
<p class="p1">house.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Frank had plucked up his courage, and now spoke to the purpose.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Mr. Clifton, as I am going away immediately after breakfast, and as I</p>
<p class="p1">am to be absent for an indefinite length of time, I wish before I leave</p>
<p class="p1">to tell you that which lies upon my heart—” here he paused a little time</p>
<p class="p1">to collect his thoughts and fine words, while the old gentleman attended</p>
<p class="p1">with an encouraging expression of countenance. Frank resumed—“Mr.</p>
<p class="p1">Clifton, I love your daughter Zuleime. And I have come to beg your</p>
<p class="p1">sanction to our engagement!” As the old man only said, “Whew-w-w-w!”</p>
<p class="p1">Frank continued—“You know my rank in the army, and my prospect of</p>
<p class="p1">promotion. You are acquainted with my family, and are aware of their</p>
<p class="p1">interest and influence in the country. Allow me farther to add, that my</p>
<p class="p1">own private fortune amounts to fifty thousand dollars. And I will settle</p>
<p class="p1">thirty thousand on my bride. Besides which—”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Stay, stay—my _dear_ fellow, stay!” interrupted the old man, with a</p>
<p class="p1">troubled look. “This is all nonsense, now! Zuleime is a child. And you</p>
<p class="p1">have not known her more than six weeks. Love Zuleime! Pooh, pooh! You</p>
<p class="p1">young men are so flighty and fickle in your fancies! You get frantic</p>
<p class="p1">about every new face you see, and think yourselves in love! Pooh, pooh!</p>
<p class="p1">Now, Frank, my boy, come! let’s hear no more of it! It’s all nonsense!</p>
<p class="p1">You young officers are always in love, or fancying yourselves so! I dare</p>
<p class="p1">say, you have been in love with all the daughters of all your</p>
<p class="p1">commanders, and Heaven forefend, a little platonically smitten with all</p>
<p class="p1">their wives, too! Come, I know you! Nonsense! Let’s hear no more of it!”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Mr. Clifton, I am no trifler in matters of the affections. I never</p>
<p class="p1">_have_ been. I never _shall_ be, I hope! And when I tell you, upon my</p>
<p class="p1">sacred honor, that never in my life have I ‘flirted,’ as it is called,</p>
<p class="p1">with a woman—that never in my life have I either loved or addressed the</p>
<p class="p1">language of love to a woman—except Zuleime—you will believe me!”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“_Oh-h-h-h!_” exclaimed the old gentleman, with an exceedingly bored</p>
<p class="p1">look. “It’s all _folly_, all _nonsense_, I tell you! A sudden fancy!</p>
<p class="p1">Nothing more! Let’s drop the subject.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Mr. Clifton,” said the young man, gravely and sorrowfully, for he saw</p>
<p class="p1">that the old gentleman rather evaded than denied or accepted his suit,</p>
<p class="p1">“I have never, in my whole life, been addicted to taking sudden and</p>
<p class="p1">evanescent fancies, as you might judge, from what I told you! And when I</p>
<p class="p1">tell you that I love your daughter Zuleime, I mean that I love her</p>
<p class="p1">sincerely and earnestly, with my whole heart and soul—and that I shall</p>
<p class="p1">love her to the last hour of my life!”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Bah! bah! It’s all _tom-foolery_, I tell you! You get yourself shut up</p>
<p class="p1">in a country house with a pretty girl, and _of course_ you fall in love</p>
<p class="p1">with her! _To be sure!_ What else could you do? It’s expected of you!</p>
<p class="p1">You’d disappoint us if you didn’t! But it is such love as will not</p>
<p class="p1">outlast your journey to your regiment.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“It will outlast my life! I know it will! I feel it will!” said Frank,</p>
<p class="p1">earnestly, vehemently.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Tah! tah! tah!—you’ll fall desperately in love with the first pretty</p>
<p class="p1">squaw of the friendly tribes who shall come to bring moccasins to your</p>
<p class="p1">frontier fort!”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Oh, God!” groaned the young man, bitterly, dropping his face into his</p>
<p class="p1">hands. “There is no way of making a serious impression upon you, and I</p>
<p class="p1">am going away in two hours!” His tone and manner so affected the really</p>
<p class="p1">impressible and benevolent old gentleman, that he half embraced him with</p>
<p class="p1">his fat arm, saying—</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Now _don’t_, Frank! _Do_ be a good boy! _Don’t! Do!_ It’s all _folly_</p>
<p class="p1">now! _Indeed_ it is! _Do! Don’t!_ Now consider—how many pretty girls</p>
<p class="p1">there are in the world! _Don’t_, Frank! A great deal prettier than my</p>
<p class="p1">girl. Never fret about her. _Do_, Frank. Besides, she’s so young! A mere</p>
<p class="p1">school-girl. Only fifteen last Monday. Pooh, pooh! Not to be thought of,</p>
<p class="p1">you know! Far too young!”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Sir, I can wait. I only wish your sanction to our engagement. I can</p>
<p class="p1">wait three or four years, if necessary, or any length of time at all, if</p>
<p class="p1">I may hope to get her at last!”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“She is too _young_, I tell you, Frank! Too young to know her own mind.</p>
<p class="p1">Only fifteen. Ridiculous!”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“But, sir, I have heard of gentlemen older and more settled than myself</p>
<p class="p1">who have actually _married_ girls of fifteen. _I_ only ask an</p>
<p class="p1">engagement!”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“You mean _me_, you dog! I know you do! I see you do! But, Frank,</p>
<p class="p1">seriously and solemnly, I wouldn’t do so again! And for the very reason</p>
<p class="p1">that _I_ committed that egregious folly, that bitter wrong against a</p>
<p class="p1">young girl, I will not suffer any one else to do the same wrong to my</p>
<p class="p1">child, if I can help it!”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“No, Mr. Clifton—pardon me, but are _you_ not about to commit a more</p>
<p class="p1">grievous wrong to your own lovely, gentle child? Have you not? Pardon</p>
<p class="p1">me! Pardon me! But _have_ you not promised her hand where she cannot</p>
<p class="p1">give her heart?”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“No! Heaven forbid! I promised her to Charley Cabell. She used to like</p>
<p class="p1">him very well. I did the best I could for her happiness. I have secured</p>
<p class="p1">it—unless—unless—oh, my God, Frank!” suddenly exclaimed the old man, in</p>
<p class="p1">his turn extremely agitated, and wiping the perspiration from his brow,</p>
<p class="p1">“I _hope_—I _trust in God_ you haven’t entrapped her affections! Frank!</p>
<p class="p1">Frank! She _is_ engaged to Major Cabell! I didn’t tell you so when you</p>
<p class="p1">first asked me for her, because—because—for many reasons—” (wiping the</p>
<p class="p1">streaming perspiration from his brow) “it is—it is—disagreeable to</p>
<p class="p1">remember and to talk about it! But—but—she _is_ engaged to Major Cabell,</p>
<p class="p1">and—and for many reasons—family reasons—it is necessary that the</p>
<p class="p1">engagement should be fulfilled! Unless—unless—some inevitable,</p>
<p class="p1">_insurmountable obstacle_ was to arise and prevent it! Frank! Frank! I</p>
<p class="p1">am in a great strait! a dire, doleful strait! but—but—sooner than make</p>
<p class="p1">my girl _un_happy, or stand in the way of her perfect happiness, I</p>
<p class="p1">would—I would—I would _die in a jail_! Where I may die! Where I may</p>
<p class="p1">die!” Nothing could exceed the force of the emotion that agitated the</p>
<p class="p1">old man, shaking his huge form, and choking up his utterance.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Mr. Fairfax looked at him with mingled astonishment, wonder and</p>
<p class="p1">compassion.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Boy—boy—you _haven’t_ entrapped my dear child’s heart?” again inquired</p>
<p class="p1">the old gentleman, trembling with excess of feeling.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“_Entrapped_ is not exactly the word, sir,” said Frank, proudly and</p>
<p class="p1">mournfully. “I learned to love her, and I won her love without designing</p>
<p class="p1">to do either!”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Lost! Lost!” cried Mr. Clifton, dropping his head upon his bosom. He</p>
<p class="p1">walked on in silence so desponding, that Fairfax could not bring himself</p>
<p class="p1">to intrude upon it. They went on until they suddenly met _Major Cabell</p>
<p class="p1">himself_ coming down the hill, apparently from Hardbargain.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">The Major was walking slowly, with his head down, and twirling around</p>
<p class="p1">his finger a topaz necklace. As soon as he perceived Messrs. Clifton and</p>
<p class="p1">Fairfax, his forehead flushed, and he hastily crammed the necklace into</p>
<p class="p1">his vest pocket. Frank thought the whole thing strange, but, but</p>
<p class="p1">stranger still was the conduct—the metamorphosis—the transfiguration of</p>
<p class="p1">Mr. Clifton, who, upon observing the Major, instantly put a violent</p>
<p class="p1">constraint upon himself, and became the broadfaced, rosy, smiling,</p>
<p class="p1">blue-eyed, debonnair old gentleman, so lavish in the display of his fine</p>
<p class="p1">teeth, and hearty, cordial words and smiles. Frank was provoked that</p>
<p class="p1">their conversation was so completely arrested.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Ah, good-morning,” said Mr. Clifton, addressing the Major. “Been to</p>
<p class="p1">Hardbargain this morning so early? How are all the folks up there? See,</p>
<p class="p1">Archer? Why didn’t he walk with you? Eh? Expected him!”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“I have not been to Hardbargain, sir,” replied the Major, rather</p>
<p class="p1">morosely.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Been out taking a morning stroll then, eh? Fine appetite for breakfast,</p>
<p class="p1">no doubt. And it is waiting for us, too. Come, Frank, let’s turn about.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">They did so. Frank now noticed for the first time that the manner of the</p>
<p class="p1">old gentleman was conciliating, while that of the Major was surly.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">They soon reached the house, and the breakfast-room, where the ladies</p>
<p class="p1">were awaiting their arrival.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">As they entered, the countenance of Carolyn Clifton was flushed and</p>
<p class="p1">eager. But when they had all got in, and were seated at the table, the</p>
<p class="p1">color died out of her face, leaving her pale as marble. She merely</p>
<p class="p1">trifled with her breakfast, pretending to eat, but no morsel passed her</p>
<p class="p1">lips. When breakfast was over, and the company dispersed about the room,</p>
<p class="p1">Carolyn almost reeled past her father in going out, and muttered with</p>
<p class="p1">pale lips—“Father! Not come yet?”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Never mind! Never mind, my dear! I will ride up to Hardbargain and</p>
<p class="p1">fetch him.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Not for the universe, father! if he never comes!” replied the</p>
<p class="p1">determined girl, plucking up her spirit, and sweeping proudly past and</p>
<p class="p1">going into the piazza, where she sat, by-the-bye, with her eyes strained</p>
<p class="p1">up the mountain-path by which he ought to come.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Frank got no opportunity of speaking alone with Zuleime. Old Mr. Clifton</p>
<p class="p1">met him, however, when he came in from looking after his horse, and</p>
<p class="p1">said, kindly patting him on the shoulder—</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Indeed, my dear boy, I don’t see the least necessity for your leaving</p>
<p class="p1">us until after dinner. The stage coach doesn’t pass through L—— till</p>
<p class="p1">eight o’clock at night, and five or six hours is ample time in which to</p>
<p class="p1">reach there!”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Yes, sir! I grant it, but I have to go this morning to Hardbargain to</p>
<p class="p1">take leave of Mrs. Clifton, and of my friend Archer, if, indeed, the</p>
<p class="p1">latter is not ordered on the same duty as myself, which, upon Miss</p>
<p class="p1">Clifton’s account, I am inclined to fear!”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Oh! Are you going to ride to Hardbargain? Then, perhaps, you will be</p>
<p class="p1">pleased to learn that Zuleime is going there this morning, also, to</p>
<p class="p1">assist Mrs. Clifton in putting the last finishing touches to her dress</p>
<p class="p1">for this evening. And you can escort her!” said Georgia, smoothly</p>
<p class="p1">gliding between them, and laying her head and hand with child-like</p>
<p class="p1">freedom and affection upon the old man’s shoulder.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Oh! I shall be very happy!” said Frank, “_really_ happy—nay,</p>
<p class="p1">_overjoyed, intoxicated_, with the prospect of an uninterrupted,</p>
<p class="p1">farewell _tête à tête_ with Zuleime.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Old Mr. Clifton looked rather disappointed, but he was not of a very</p>
<p class="p1">combative disposition—especially had he no inclination to contradict</p>
<p class="p1">Georgia. Besides, he at once reflected that there was really no danger.</p>
<p class="p1">They couldn’t be married in the neighborhood, because they could get no</p>
<p class="p1">license, and no clergyman dare marry them without one. And it was not</p>
<p class="p1">probable, or even possible, that Frank would elope with his daughter on</p>
<p class="p1">the very eve of joining his regiment for a distant and dangerous</p>
<p class="p1">service. In truth, he felt it was folly to cherish a misgiving. And yet</p>
<p class="p1">he _had_ misgivings, nor could he banish them—the utmost extent of his</p>
<p class="p1">self-control was—not to _act_ upon them—not to forbid their riding</p>
<p class="p1">together. While Zuleime was putting on her hat and riding habit, Frank</p>
<p class="p1">got the ear of the old gentleman once more, and for the last time. The</p>
<p class="p1">old man had sunk into his broadbottomed flag chair in the hall, with his</p>
<p class="p1">thick gold-headed stick between his knees, and his two hands and his</p>
<p class="p1">chin resting upon it, when Frank stood before him with folded arms and</p>
<p class="p1">head dropped upon his breast, and said—</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Mr. Clifton—once more, and for the last time, I ask you, and I implore</p>
<p class="p1">you to answer me candidly. Is there any possibility that, under any</p>
<p class="p1">change of circumstances, at any future time, I may hope for your consent</p>
<p class="p1">to my union with Zuleime?”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">The earnestness, deepening almost into solemnity, of the young man’s</p>
<p class="p1">manner and words, impressed Mr. Clifton very deeply, but he replied—“Mr.</p>
<p class="p1">Fairfax, it is best to speak the plain, harsh, cutting truth, though</p>
<p class="p1">that truth is the axe laid to the root of all your hopes of Zuleime. No.</p>
<p class="p1">Yet I regret this, Frank! You do not know how much! But you must forget</p>
<p class="p1">her! I hope you will _soon_ do so! I know you _must_!”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Frank shook his head in despairing negation. And farther colloquy was</p>
<p class="p1">arrested by the coming down of Zuleime equipped for her ride.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Come here, my daughter! Now you must be _sure_ to be back by dinner</p>
<p class="p1">time, do you hear?”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Certainly, sir!”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“_Promise_ me.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Of course I do.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Upon your _honor_!” said the old man, seriously.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Upon my honor, sir, I will return by dinner time! But what makes you so</p>
<p class="p1">emphatic about it, dear father?”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“A notion of mine, my child! but I have your promise!”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Of course you have, sir!” said Zuleime, drawing on her gloves.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Mr. Fairfax was taking leave of Mrs. Clifton. Presently he turned to bid</p>
<p class="p1">adieu to Mr. Clifton.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">The old gentleman shook his hand warmly, wishing him all the success he</p>
<p class="p1">desired, and affecting to laugh and jest, while he exacted a like</p>
<p class="p1">promise from Fairfax, namely, that he should take his girl to</p>
<p class="p1">Hardbargain, and leave her there to return by dinner time.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Frank gave his word very cheerfully. The young couple then mounted and</p>
<p class="p1">rode away. The old man watched them from the piazza in sorrowful love,</p>
<p class="p1">murmuring—</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“God bless them. I wish they _could_ be married. Poor things. If they</p>
<p class="p1">_do_ love each other so much, or if they _think_ they do, which is quite</p>
<p class="p1">as bad while it lasts—why, it is but kind to let them have this last</p>
<p class="p1">little parting comfort of a ride together! And it was well, too—”</p>
<p class="p1">chuckled the old gentleman—“to tie them up with promises, so that they</p>
<p class="p1">can’t run away, which they might else be tempted to do in their parting</p>
<p class="p1">hour. But they will neither of them ever break their word, and I shall</p>
<p class="p1">have her back safe by dinner time. For it is utterly impossible for them</p>
<p class="p1">to get married without a license, and it is quite impracticable to get a</p>
<p class="p1">license this side of L——, or to ride to L—— between this and noon, much</p>
<p class="p1">less to ride thither and return here in time for dinner! Ah! I have them</p>
<p class="p1">there! And yet, I am sorry for them, too. Poor things!”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">All this time Carolyn Clifton had sat like one dead, only with her eyes</p>
<p class="p1">strained up the mountain bridal-path.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">In the meantime, Frank and Zuleime pursued their ride. As soon as they</p>
<p class="p1">were out of sight and hearing of a band of field laborers, employed in</p>
<p class="p1">cutting grass, and had entered the shady mountain-path, Frank said—</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Well, Zuleime, my dearest girl, I spoke to your father—”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">—“And his answer—I almost dread to hear it—yet I know what it was, too.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Frank nodded his head, and they rode on in silence for some minutes,</p>
<p class="p1">broken at last by Frank, who suddenly exclaimed—</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Zuleime! you bear this so well!”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Frank, you know this is no new thing to me; I have known it, and been</p>
<p class="p1">prepared for it all along!” replied the girl, with a look of</p>
<p class="p1">resignation.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Oh, Zuleime! is there no way to prevent it?”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“None that I know of, Frank!”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Zuleime! I was in every way his equal—why, when that is the case, and</p>
<p class="p1">when I was supported by your voice, too—_why_ was I rejected?”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">The maiden shook her head.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Zuleime, when is this hideous marriage expected to come off—do you</p>
<p class="p1">know?”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Whenever Major Cabell chooses to demand my hand, I believe!”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Really! Upon my word! He is a personage of tremendous importance!</p>
<p class="p1">Whenever HE chooses to demand your hand!! Zuleime! that is passing</p>
<p class="p1">strange! This affair seems then to rest entirely with Major Cabell!!!”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Yes, it does entirely.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Bless his Majesty. Zuleime, _what hold has that man on your father_?”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Zuleime shook her black ringlets mournfully, but did not reply.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Do you know, my dear girl, that I am impressed with the idea that your</p>
<p class="p1">father does not at heart wish to give you to Major Cabell, but rather</p>
<p class="p1">yields to a strange power the man holds over him?”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“At times I have thought so, too. But then my dear father at other times</p>
<p class="p1">really seems so set upon the marriage, that the thought has been driven</p>
<p class="p1">out of my head again! I do not know what to think! But what I _do_ know</p>
<p class="p1">is, that I will never willingly do anything to give my dear father</p>
<p class="p1">pain!”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“My dearest girl, do you know that I believe, from my soul, that your</p>
<p class="p1">marriage with Major Cabell will give your father more pain than any</p>
<p class="p1">other circumstance could?”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">The young girl looked up in surprise.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Zuleime! he told me to-day, that though he had promised you to Major</p>
<p class="p1">Cabell, he would rather die than see you _un_happy, or stand in the way</p>
<p class="p1">of your _perfect_ happiness!”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“My dear father! My dear, gentle father! My fond, old father!” exclaimed</p>
<p class="p1">Zuleime, with the bright tears rolling on her damask cheeks, like dew on</p>
<p class="p1">the red rose. “My kind, generous father! He shall never know that I am</p>
<p class="p1">unhappy! And neither _shall_ I be unhappy when pleasing him!”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“My dear, excellent girl! listen to me! You shall not be unhappy any</p>
<p class="p1">way! Do you suppose, Zuleime, that I could ride by your side so</p>
<p class="p1">cheerfully, if I thought you were going to marry that man, on whom your</p>
<p class="p1">father no more wishes to bestow you, than he wishes to send you to</p>
<p class="p1">perdition? Listen, my darling girl! When your father told me what I have</p>
<p class="p1">repeated to you, he went on to say, that for certain _family_ reasons,</p>
<p class="p1">it was incumbent on him to fulfill his promise, and to bestow your hand</p>
<p class="p1">upon Major Cabell, _unless some insurmountable obstacle should interpose</p>
<p class="p1">to arrest the union_! Zuleime! a flood of light broke on me then! and I</p>
<p class="p1">felt and knew that the old man would yield his darling daughter to the</p>
<p class="p1">mysterious power exercised over him by Major Cabell, rather than bestow</p>
<p class="p1">her with esteem and affection! Zuleime! without vanity, I think that he</p>
<p class="p1">loves me better, and would prefer me for a son-in-law, if he were free</p>
<p class="p1">to choose. I think, indeed I do, that he would hail with secret joy “an</p>
<p class="p1">insurmountable obstacle,” which would prevent the marriage, and not</p>
<p class="p1">implicate him in any manner. I think that was what he meant when he said</p>
<p class="p1">what he did. Still, I am convinced that the words slipped from him</p>
<p class="p1">unintentionally. I am certain he did not mean to give me the hint, which</p>
<p class="p1">nevertheless, I take, for he is a man of strict honor, I know, and would</p>
<p class="p1">never tamper with the _spirit_ of a promise any more than he would break</p>
<p class="p1">the _words_!”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Oh! no, he never would, indeed!”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“And again, my dearest girl, when I asked him just before we came away,</p>
<p class="p1">whether, at any future time, under any possible contingency, I might</p>
<p class="p1">hope to obtain his consent to our union, he assured me that I might not,</p>
<p class="p1">and earnestly entreated me to forget you! That further convinced me that</p>
<p class="p1">he had no design in giving me the hint upon which I am about to act—do</p>
<p class="p1">you hear me, dearest Zuleime?”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Zuleime did not, or at least did not appear to.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Zuleime, my darling, my love,” said Frank, dismounting in the path, and</p>
<p class="p1">lifting her from her saddle. “I am about to raise ’an insurmountable</p>
<p class="p1">obstacle’ to your marriage with the Major!”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Zuleime turned deadly pale with surprise and terror, and glanced wildly</p>
<p class="p1">around, while she fell upon his arm and seemed about to faint.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Why, Zuleime! Come, come. What is the matter? Don’t be afraid! What,</p>
<p class="p1">afraid of _me_, of _Frank_, your playmate? Why, look up in my face and</p>
<p class="p1">see! Come lift up your head! I want to talk to you! There! there! Why,</p>
<p class="p1">what are you afraid of? I will take _no_ step without your consent,</p>
<p class="p1">sweet Zuleime!”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">The infinite tenderness of his words, tones and manner, reassured the</p>
<p class="p1">frightened girl, and she raised her face, now suffused with blushes. He</p>
<p class="p1">supported her with his arm around her waist, while he pointed down into</p>
<p class="p1">a narrow glen to the right, and said—</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“There! Look there, Zuleime. Do you see that little stone house—there in</p>
<p class="p1">the bottom of the glen—there by the spring—but so much like the rocks,</p>
<p class="p1">near it, and so deep in the shade, as hardly to be distinguishable! Do</p>
<p class="p1">you see it?”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Yes,” breathed the maiden, very low.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Do you know who lives there?”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“No.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“A good old man! A saintly old man! A poor Baptist missionary preacher,</p>
<p class="p1">who lives in that hut quite alone, and _preaches_ there every Sunday to</p>
<p class="p1">an humble congregation, composed of poor mountaineers and negroes. He</p>
<p class="p1">has devoted his life to labor among the mountain people, and has done</p>
<p class="p1">wonders in reforming them! Is it possible that _you_, living in the</p>
<p class="p1">neighborhood, knew nothing of him?”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Oh, yes! I have heard a great deal about Mr. Saunders, only I did not</p>
<p class="p1">know where exactly his hut was. There are so many of them, you know!”</p>
<p class="p1">said the girl, somewhat recovered, and much interested.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“My dearest Zuleime! we will go down to that hut! ‘I see by the smoke,</p>
<p class="p1">that so gracefully curls,’ that the old man is at home. We will tell him</p>
<p class="p1">the whole story, as far as we know it, and get him to raise that</p>
<p class="p1">required insurmountable obstacle!”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Oh! Frank!” exclaimed Zuleime, shocked, delighted, terrified,</p>
<p class="p1">overjoyed.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“But, my dearest Zuleime! my dearest love! I have recorded an oath in</p>
<p class="p1">Heaven, to save you from that marriage with Cabell! And I will never</p>
<p class="p1">leave you until you are my wife. If you refuse NOW, I will throw up my</p>
<p class="p1">commission in the army, and live there in that hut with the old parson,</p>
<p class="p1">until you _do_ consent!”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“But, my father, Frank! My dear father!”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Dearest girl, he will be glad!” Here Frank went over the whole story</p>
<p class="p1">again, and added—“And Zuleime, have you no love, no pity left from your</p>
<p class="p1">father to bestow upon the poor soldier who loves you so, and who is</p>
<p class="p1">going out to the Indian frontier, where he may lose his scalp, or be</p>
<p class="p1">burned alive, or eaten raw within a month by the red-skins? Will you</p>
<p class="p1">refuse his last prayer?” etc., etc., etc. Over and over again,</p>
<p class="p1">fervently, earnestly, imploringly, despairingly he repeated the argument</p>
<p class="p1">and the prayer, while he held the maiden “half willing, half afraid.”</p>
<p class="p1">“She who hesitates is lost,” it is said.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Zuleime hesitated a long time, and, consequently, was lost to all</p>
<p class="p1">eternity. What could she oppose, indeed, to what seemed so right and</p>
<p class="p1">reasonable? With a deep sigh she yielded at last. There was no path that</p>
<p class="p1">way down into the glen, and the descent was deep and precipitous, and</p>
<p class="p1">overgrown with stunted cedar, pine and thorn bushes. So, Romeo and</p>
<p class="p1">Juliet began to clamber down, by foot-holds of jagged rocks, and</p>
<p class="p1">fist-holds of thorn bushes, to the great risk of wounded hands and torn</p>
<p class="p1">pants and petticoats. And so it was in rather a disordered state of</p>
<p class="p1">attire, as well as in an excited state of mind, that they at last</p>
<p class="p1">arrived before the door of Father Lawrence’s cell, and rapped. While</p>
<p class="p1">they waited for the old man to appear, Frank, very much to the surprise</p>
<p class="p1">of Zuleime, drew from his vest pocket a license—a regular _bona fide_</p>
<p class="p1">license, signed by the clerk of R—— county, and sealed with the county</p>
<p class="p1">seal. Resting his foot upon the door-step, he took off his hat, turned</p>
<p class="p1">it down on his knee, laid the license upon its top, and drawing from his</p>
<p class="p1">other pocket a travelling pen and ink case, proceeded to write the names</p>
<p class="p1">of Francis Rutland Fairfax and Zuleime Dovilliers Clifton in the blank</p>
<p class="p1">spaces.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“You look surprised, my dearest girl,” said he, as he returned the pen</p>
<p class="p1">and ink case to his pocket. “You wonder how I came by this license? I</p>
<p class="p1">will tell you. I have it by a stroke of the rarest good fortune. You</p>
<p class="p1">know, being groomsman, I was entrusted with the duty of riding to L——,</p>
<p class="p1">and procuring the marriage license for Archer and your sister. Well!</p>
<p class="p1">when I arrived at the clerk’s office, by the strangest caprice of</p>
<p class="p1">memory, I entirely forgot Miss Clifton’s middle name; so I got the clerk</p>
<p class="p1">to give me one license filled out with the names of Carolyn Clifton and</p>
<p class="p1">Archer Clifton, and then knowing how extremely punctilious you all are</p>
<p class="p1">here, in this county, I procured another license regularly signed and</p>
<p class="p1">sealed, but leaving blank spaces for the proper names of the parties!</p>
<p class="p1">There, darling! that is the manner in which I came by it! Now, this</p>
<p class="p1">blank one I fill up with our names, which I really think look quite as</p>
<p class="p1">pretty as the others would! As for Clifton and your sister, if they want</p>
<p class="p1">a license, they will have to put up with the first, which I will hand to</p>
<p class="p1">Archer as soon as we get to Hardbargain. Bless my soul! what has become</p>
<p class="p1">of that old man?” he exclaimed, rapping loudly, then trying the door and</p>
<p class="p1">pushing it open. The house was empty. Frank looked dismally</p>
<p class="p1">disappointed, but Zuleime plucked him by the sleeve, and whispered,</p>
<p class="p1">hurriedly—</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Here he comes—behind you!”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">And he turned to see the old preacher coming from the spring, bending</p>
<p class="p1">under the light weight of a small pail of water. Frank immediately went</p>
<p class="p1">to him, greeted him respectfully, and took from his hand the pail, and</p>
<p class="p1">carrying it, walked by his side, till they reached the house. Lieutenant</p>
<p class="p1">Fairfax then introduced himself by name and station, and presented Miss</p>
<p class="p1">Zuleime Clifton. The old man bowed and offered his hand, with a courtly</p>
<p class="p1">grace, in strange contrast to his rude garb and rough habitation. He</p>
<p class="p1">invited them to come in and sit down. And when they had entered, and</p>
<p class="p1">Zuleime was seated, Frank took the old man aside, communicated the</p>
<p class="p1">object of their call, and produced his license. The old man glanced from</p>
<p class="p1">the earnest countenance of Frank to the blushing, downcast face of</p>
<p class="p1">Zuleime, shook his bald head, and looked very grave.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Frank drew him off to the farthest corner of the little hut, made him</p>
<p class="p1">sit down on the foot of his bed, seated himself by his side, and in a</p>
<p class="p1">fervid, earnest, eloquent manner, told him their little story.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Many times the old man shook his thin, gray locks. They were not good</p>
<p class="p1">things—these secret marriages—they never prospered. Marriage should be</p>
<p class="p1">open as day—with the blessing of God—with the blessing of parents—with</p>
<p class="p1">the sympathy of friends—with the good wishes of acquaintances to hallow</p>
<p class="p1">and prosper the union.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Oh!” said Frank, but this was an extraordinary occasion, the father was</p>
<p class="p1">really at heart not opposed to this marriage, but circumstances</p>
<p class="p1">compelled him to withhold his open consent—he himself, (Frank,) was</p>
<p class="p1">about to depart on a long journey, and merely wished to secure his bride</p>
<p class="p1">against a forced marriage of convenience during his absence. In short,</p>
<p class="p1">Frank recommenced the argument, and told it all over from beginning to</p>
<p class="p1">end.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Still the old man shook his bald head and demurred.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Frank began the story over again, recited the whole of it, with many</p>
<p class="p1">additions and improvements.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">To no purpose—the old man was obdurate. Frank, then half angrily, arose</p>
<p class="p1">and said—</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Come Zuleime! We must go on to the frontier together, and find somebody</p>
<p class="p1">to marry us on the route, and let Mr. Saunders here be responsible for</p>
<p class="p1">all trouble that may ensue, since with the license before him, he</p>
<p class="p1">refuses to unite us.” At this, Zuleime burst into tears and wept</p>
<p class="p1">heartily.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">The old preacher dropped his head upon his breast in troubled thought</p>
<p class="p1">for some moments, and, whether the arguments of Frank had after all</p>
<p class="p1">produced some effect, or whether he feared to encounter the</p>
<p class="p1">responsibility of sending this wild young couple on their way unmarried,</p>
<p class="p1">or whether he was moved to pity by the tears of Zuleime, or whether, as</p>
<p class="p1">is more probable, _all_ these considerations actuated him, I know not;</p>
<p class="p1">but he slowly rose to his feet, uncovered his head, and lifted up his</p>
<p class="p1">eyes in silent prayer awhile, then bade the young pair stand up, for</p>
<p class="p1">that he would marry them.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Frank clasped the hand of Zuleime, and led her forward. And in less than</p>
<p class="p1">fifteen minutes more, by the magic of a few words, the youth and maiden</p>
<p class="p1">were man and wife. And while Mrs. Fairfax, with trembling white fingers,</p>
<p class="p1">was tying her hat, Mr. Fairfax would have emptied the whole contents of</p>
<p class="p1">his purse in the minister’s hands,—but, though that money might have</p>
<p class="p1">supplied the poor old preacher with many necessaries for which he really</p>
<p class="p1">suffered, and made him very comfortable for a long time, yet he turned</p>
<p class="p1">away his head, and put it away from him, saying—</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“No, young man, I cannot take your gold; I may have erred in what I have</p>
<p class="p1">done, but I did not do it for money.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“But you always take a fee, do you not?”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“From others I do—not from you. It would not be blessed.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">The boyish brow of Frank clouded and darkened, but it cleared again</p>
<p class="p1">instantly as he turned towards his bride.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">They were about to bid the old minister adieu, when he took a hand of</p>
<p class="p1">each, and joining them again, held them in his own, while he said—</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Children, if this thoughtless act bring you into much trouble, in the</p>
<p class="p1">long, weary years of trial and suffering that may result from it,</p>
<p class="p1">reproach _me_ for my share in the rash deed as much as you please,</p>
<p class="p1">but,—” he paused and looked solemnly from one to the other,—“never, as</p>
<p class="p1">you value love, and fidelity, and peace,—never, as you value the favor</p>
<p class="p1">of Heaven, never reproach each other with it! So may God forgive, and</p>
<p class="p1">bless, and prosper you! Good-bye!”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">The young bride and groom had bowed their heads during this benediction,</p>
<p class="p1">and at its close responded with a silent, heartfelt amen. They then left</p>
<p class="p1">the cabin.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">If the minister of God grievously erred in performing this secret</p>
<p class="p1">marriage ceremony, he was soon called to account for it; the old man</p>
<p class="p1">died that night.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">As Mr. and Mrs. Fairfax left the cabin, they perceived Kate Kavanagh, on</p>
<p class="p1">her little rough-coated mountain pony, coming straight down into the</p>
<p class="p1">glen—her sure-footed little animal treading with perfect security the</p>
<p class="p1">precipitous descent down which they had been obliged to clamber. Kate</p>
<p class="p1">was looking very pale and care-worn, so that her ponderous abutting</p>
<p class="p1">forehead, in its pallor, reminded Frank of a barebleached cliff. And,</p>
<p class="p1">indeed, he thought that Kate’s face looked more like that of an anxious</p>
<p class="p1">politician, with the affairs of a nation on his shoulders, than of a</p>
<p class="p1">grieved girl. But this was the fault of her marked features. But little</p>
<p class="p1">time or thought had Mr. Fairfax to bestow upon the mountain-girl; so as</p>
<p class="p1">soon as he caught sight of her, he turned in another direction, to avoid</p>
<p class="p1">being recognized, saying—</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“By all that’s fatal, my dearest love, we were near being detected! And</p>
<p class="p1">by all that’s fortunate, we have escaped! Come, this way, we will take a</p>
<p class="p1">stroll down the glen and into the forest for a little while, until this</p>
<p class="p1">girl is clear of the way.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Oh, but it will delay us so much, I shall not have time to go to</p>
<p class="p1">Hardbargain, and assist Aunt Clifton, and get back home to dinner, as I</p>
<p class="p1">promised!”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“_My dear!_” said Frank, reproachfully, “do you grudge me these last few</p>
<p class="p1">hours of your society, when we are about to be separated so far and so</p>
<p class="p1">long? Besides, you know you are my own dear wife now. Will you refuse?”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“No, no, I cannot! But, oh, let me return to father—my dear, fond,</p>
<p class="p1">confiding father,—as soon as I promised! Let me keep the word of promise</p>
<p class="p1">to his ear, if I have broken it to his hope!” cried Zuleime, bursting</p>
<p class="p1">into a passion of tears.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Safe tears, and unobserved but by him who kissed them away, for already</p>
<p class="p1">they had entered the thicket, and were veiled from the sight of Kate</p>
<p class="p1">Kavanagh, who now dismounted before the door of the hut, and taking from</p>
<p class="p1">the horns of the saddle a basket and a bundle, entered the poor</p>
<p class="p1">preacher’s humble habitation. We will turn from the erring pair and</p>
<p class="p1">enter with her. None but God knew how much disinterested good the poor</p>
<p class="p1">mountain-girl did in this world. Even the minister, who loved and</p>
<p class="p1">respected her, knew little beyond the good she did for him. He knew that</p>
<p class="p1">she knit new stockings and darned old ones for him—that she took his</p>
<p class="p1">scanty clothing every week, and mended, and washed, and ironed it for</p>
<p class="p1">him—and that when she brought it back, she would always bring him</p>
<p class="p1">butter, cream and cheese of her own making, and a fresh loaf of rising</p>
<p class="p1">bread of her own baking, and often some little rural luxury besides, as</p>
<p class="p1">a jar of honey or a piece of venison. And that she would stay and clean</p>
<p class="p1">up his house before she left. He knew that she was his good spirit.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">As Kate entered the room, the old man came and met her, and took the</p>
<p class="p1">basket and the bundle from her hands and set them down, and set a chair</p>
<p class="p1">for her, and made her sit down in it, while he said—</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“My dear child! my excellent child, you do too much for me! You hurt</p>
<p class="p1">yourself, Catherine, and make me too deeply your debtor!”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Kate waved her hand in that quick, short way peculiar to herself,</p>
<p class="p1">silently beseeching him to stop.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“But it is the truth, Catherine, my child! I shall never be able to</p>
<p class="p1">repay you!”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Oh, sir! you have reversed the case! It is _I_ who am _your_ debtor! If</p>
<p class="p1">I were not _particularly_ your debtor for all the education—mental, and</p>
<p class="p1">moral, and religious, that I have ever received, up to the time of my</p>
<p class="p1">coming to Hardbargain—still I should be _generally_ your debtor, as</p>
<p class="p1">youth is the general debtor of age—owing it all the service it can</p>
<p class="p1">give.” Then, to change the subject, the girl laid off her straw hat,</p>
<p class="p1">drew off her sheep-skin home-made mittens, and arose and uncovered her</p>
<p class="p1">basket, saying—“Instead of a loaf of rising bread, Mr. Saunders, I have</p>
<p class="p1">brought you some fresh biscuits; I thought they might be an agreeable</p>
<p class="p1">change. There is also a fresh print of butter, and a bottle of cream,</p>
<p class="p1">and a beef’s tongue, boiled—I thought the last would give you an</p>
<p class="p1">appetite—I think you have not had a good appetite, lately!” And without</p>
<p class="p1">more ado Catherine put the things away in the cupboard, setting the</p>
<p class="p1">bottle of cream in a bowl of water, to keep cool, and wishing to herself</p>
<p class="p1">that she had a lump of ice to put on the old man’s print of butter.</p>
<p class="p1">Next, she unrolled the bundle, took the old man’s nicely washed and</p>
<p class="p1">mended clothes, and put them neatly away in the chest of drawers. Then</p>
<p class="p1">she set the empty basket aside, rolled up her sleeves, stooped down upon</p>
<p class="p1">the hearth, and began to make the fire, saying—“You know I have come to</p>
<p class="p1">dine with you to-day, Mr. Saunders!”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“I know you have come to bring me many comforts, and to cook my dinner,</p>
<p class="p1">and clean up my house, and make me very comfortable, you good girl, my</p>
<p class="p1">dear little Brownie!”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Catherine moved about, in her quick and quiet way—filled and put on the</p>
<p class="p1">kettle—for the old man would always have his cup of tea—and set the</p>
<p class="p1">table, placing all the little rarities she had brought upon it. When all</p>
<p class="p1">was ready, and they sat down, the old man found leisure to observe that</p>
<p class="p1">Kate ate nothing, and looked pale and thoughtful.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“What is the matter, my dear Kate?—you who are _always_ serious, are</p>
<p class="p1">_now_ positively sorrowful! What is it?”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Kate, who was truth itself whenever she spoke, chose for that reason to</p>
<p class="p1">give no answer.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">The old man looked more and more disturbed, and laying down his knife</p>
<p class="p1">and fork, said—</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Nay, but Catherine, my dear child, there is something the matter! I do</p>
<p class="p1">not wish to intrude on your confidence, but if you have any trouble that</p>
<p class="p1">you think I may possibly be able to soothe—confide in me, as if I were</p>
<p class="p1">your own father, my child.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Dear Mr. Saunders, don’t trouble your good heart about my cloudy face.</p>
<p class="p1">Sure and hasn’t a poor girl the same right to her smoke that a wealthy</p>
<p class="p1">young lady has to her vapors?” said Kate, smiling.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">The old minister did not press his question, but resumed his knife and</p>
<p class="p1">fork with a look of mortification that worried Catherine, so that she</p>
<p class="p1">said—</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“I will tell you, then, what troubles me. My dearest, best friend and</p>
<p class="p1">patron, Captain Clifton, has bidden me good-bye, and departed for the</p>
<p class="p1">frontier! That is bad—oh, yes!—very bad. But that is not the worst. He</p>
<p class="p1">has gone away very unhappy. I might as well tell you what everybody will</p>
<p class="p1">soon know:—his marriage is broken off! He has gone away in anger with</p>
<p class="p1">his promised bride. He has gone away so wretched! Mr. Saunders, when I</p>
<p class="p1">saw him last night, looking so pale, and stern, and proud—and knew the</p>
<p class="p1">haughtiness and the anguish of his heart, I thought I could have died to</p>
<p class="p1">have restored peace and joy between him and her he loved so strongly.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Merciful Heaven!—those Cliftons! This is another instance of their</p>
<p class="p1">fatal subjection to passion! Do you know, my dear child, what caused</p>
<p class="p1">this quarrel?”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“I know nothing but this—the marriage is broken off for the present! I</p>
<p class="p1">do not know wherefore.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Some jealous suspicion of one party or the other! Those Cliftons all</p>
<p class="p1">have Spanish blood in them, and the Spanish character is uppermost in</p>
<p class="p1">their nature. They are all haughty, reserved, jealous, suspicious.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Ah, but they are full of courage, magnanimity and benevolence,” said</p>
<p class="p1">Catherine.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Archer Clifton is of a very jealous and suspicious nature—was his</p>
<p class="p1">betrothed inclined to coquetry?”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Oh, I do not know, sir, but the misunderstanding did not originate in</p>
<p class="p1">any charge against Miss Clifton. It was something of which Miss Clifton</p>
<p class="p1">accused _him_, but of what, I do not know!—he did not say. My dear Mr.</p>
<p class="p1">Saunders, I told you what troubled me, to satisfy your kind heart, and</p>
<p class="p1">allay your benevolent anxiety on my account. And now please forgive me,</p>
<p class="p1">for beseeching you not to question me farther upon the subject. They—the</p>
<p class="p1">parties, I mean—are far removed above my sphere of thought and</p>
<p class="p1">action—and the investigation of their motives of action, by me, seems to</p>
<p class="p1">involve a certain indelicacy—I fear even impertinence of interference,”</p>
<p class="p1">said Catherine, gently.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Yet, far above your sphere of thought and action as you say they are,</p>
<p class="p1">they are not—at least _one_ of them is not—above your sphere of sympathy</p>
<p class="p1">and emotion. _His_ sorrow affects _you_ with sorrow!”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">The blood rushed to Kate’s brow, and she remained silent.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">The old man and the maiden soon after arose from the table. She washed</p>
<p class="p1">up the dishes, tidied up the house, and collected the poor preacher’s</p>
<p class="p1">soiled and broken clothes, and tied them in a bundle to take away with</p>
<p class="p1">her to wash and mend. Then she tied on her hat, and took leave of him;</p>
<p class="p1">the old man calling her back, again and again, with vague, prophetic</p>
<p class="p1">meaning, to repeat over and over—“God bless you, my child! God bless</p>
<p class="p1">you!” It was his dying benediction.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">A poor mountaineer, that called early the next morning to get the poor</p>
<p class="p1">minister to the poor to come and bury his wife—found the old man dead.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>

<p class="p1">attitude in which we left her, affecting to read, but really watching</p>
<p class="p1">the mountain-path with heart-sickening anxiety. Every distant sound of a</p>
<p class="p1">horse’s hoofs that struck upon her ear, sent an electric shock to her</p>
<p class="p1">heart, causing her to start violently, tremble, and turn deadly sick and</p>
<p class="p1">faint, with accelerated hope and fear, until its nearer approach</p>
<p class="p1">revealed some neighbor going on his way, or some negro coming from the</p>
<p class="p1">mill or the village, to her despairing sight. Even the sound of carriage</p>
<p class="p1">wheels, as they occasionally rolled by, made her heart pause in its</p>
<p class="p1">pulsations until it passed, and proved to be some family going on a</p>
<p class="p1">visit or a shopping errand.—For still she hoped that if he did not come</p>
<p class="p1">down the mountain-path on horseback, he might come round the road with</p>
<p class="p1">his mother in her carriage. He came not. And oh, the wedding-day was</p>
<p class="p1">almost over! No one saw the strife of hope and fear, like the struggle</p>
<p class="p1">of life and death, going on silently in her bosom. Mrs. Georgia Clifton</p>
<p class="p1">spent the whole forenoon in her own apartment, professing to be engaged</p>
<p class="p1">with many elegant preparations for the evening; but really full of</p>
<p class="p1">triumph for the success of her wicked scheming, and anxiety and wonder</p>
<p class="p1">for the events of the evening, and dark regret also for the absence of</p>
<p class="p1">him who, if lost to Carolyn forever, was lost to herself for a time at</p>
<p class="p1">least. With all these passions and emotions striving in her bosom, she</p>
<p class="p1">dared not show herself, lest her conscious heart and conscious face</p>
<p class="p1">should betray her—for Georgia was yet young in wickedness.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">The Misses Cabell were in their own chamber, putting a few finishing</p>
<p class="p1">touches to their dresses for the evening, for they, with Zuleime, were</p>
<p class="p1">to be the bridesmaids.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Zuleime herself had not yet returned, although it was near noon.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Old Mr. Clifton had been out, as was his daily habit of a forenoon,</p>
<p class="p1">riding around his plantation.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">He came in to-day a little earlier than usual, and finding his daughter</p>
<p class="p1">exactly where he left her, but looking still more pale, haggard and</p>
<p class="p1">anxious than in the morning, he sat down by her side, put his arm</p>
<p class="p1">tenderly around her waist, and gazed lovingly into her whitened and</p>
<p class="p1">sharpened countenance, before he said interrogatively—</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Not come yet, Carolyn?”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“No, sir!” answered the young lady rising and putting off her father’s</p>
<p class="p1">caressing arm, and her own humiliating despondency, with a proud and</p>
<p class="p1">queenly air.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Well!” said the old man, with sudden energy, “I WILL certainly now ride</p>
<p class="p1">up to Hardbargain and know the reason. DANDY!—my horse, there! Bring him</p>
<p class="p1">back!—I’ve not done with him!”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Father!” said Carolyn, seizing his hand, and detaining him, while she</p>
<p class="p1">raised her head and looked and spoke in a manner that reminded him more</p>
<p class="p1">strongly than ever of her arrogant mother, “Father, _no_, you will not</p>
<p class="p1">go! No, no, father, if you have any love for _me_, any respect for the</p>
<p class="p1">memory of my dead mother, _do not_ subject her daughter and yours to</p>
<p class="p1">such a mortification! No, father, if he _never_ comes, never go after</p>
<p class="p1">him!”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“You’re a fool, girl!” cried the old man, breaking away from her, “a</p>
<p class="p1">palpable fool!—You were a fool for quarreling with him and sending him</p>
<p class="p1">away, and now you are a greater fool for persisting in the quarrel.</p>
<p class="p1">‘Mortification,’ indeed! Who’ll be the most mortified this evening, I</p>
<p class="p1">wonder, ‘if he never comes?’ What the deuce are we to say to the people</p>
<p class="p1">who will come here this evening to see you married? Tell me that?”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Before she could say another word, a large family carriage rolled down</p>
<p class="p1">the road, and turned and entered the lawn.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Carolyn sank back in her seat, nearly swooning with the swift hope and</p>
<p class="p1">fear that strove almost to agony as she gazed.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">It looked so like Mrs. Clifton’s carriage.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">It was not, however. It contained the very earliest of the wedding</p>
<p class="p1">guests, who, coming from a distance of thirty miles, had set out early</p>
<p class="p1">enough to arrive in time to secure a whole afternoon’s rest and</p>
<p class="p1">refreshment before dressing for the evening. This was customary with</p>
<p class="p1">those coming from afar.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Old Mr. Clifton went down the steps, to receive his guests.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Carolyn arose and withdrew into the house, fortunately before she had</p>
<p class="p1">been recognized by the visitors; for it would have been shockingly out</p>
<p class="p1">of all etiquette for a bride to be visible on her wedding-day before the</p>
<p class="p1">wedding-hour.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">When Mr. Clifton had ushered his guests into the drawing-room, he</p>
<p class="p1">returned to the piazza to give some directions concerning the stabling</p>
<p class="p1">of the horses, for where so many animals were expected to be provided</p>
<p class="p1">for, it required some extra thought and care in their bestowal. While</p>
<p class="p1">still giving his orders, he saw his younger daughter riding slowly up to</p>
<p class="p1">the house. Pleased to see her return in safety, in spite of his evil</p>
<p class="p1">forebodings of the morning, and thinking besides that she could give him</p>
<p class="p1">some news of the laggard bridegroom, he hastened to meet her and lift</p>
<p class="p1">her from the saddle, with a joyous—</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Well, my darling! well, my damask rose-bud! Back in time, according to</p>
<p class="p1">promise, eh?”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">But at the sight of her father, the girl’s face flushed and paled so</p>
<p class="p1">swiftly, her bosom rose and fell so rapidly, her whole frame was so</p>
<p class="p1">agitated, her manner so confused, that the old man was seized with alarm</p>
<p class="p1">and exclaimed, hurriedly—</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“In the name of Heaven, my dearest child, what is the matter?”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">But Zuleime, incapable of reply, looked as if she would sink into the</p>
<p class="p1">ground.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Mr. Clifton’s first definite thought was that some accident or</p>
<p class="p1">catastrophe had befallen the bridegroom.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Good Heaven, Zuleime, what has happened? Where is Archer Clifton?</p>
<p class="p1">Speak—has he come to any harm?”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Much relieved that her father’s suspicions had fallen out of the true</p>
<p class="p1">track—yet still considerably shaken, Zuleime replied, in a faltering</p>
<p class="p1">voice, that Captain Clifton had received orders, and had departed that</p>
<p class="p1">morning with Lieutenant Fairfax for Winchester, where their regiment was</p>
<p class="p1">quartered, and that Mrs. Clifton, of Hardbargain, desired to see Mr.</p>
<p class="p1">Clifton as soon as possible. Without another word—totally unsuspicious</p>
<p class="p1">that Mrs. Fairfax stood before him—the old man threw himself on</p>
<p class="p1">horseback, and rode furiously toward Hardbargain.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Mrs. Frank Fairfax, our runaway daughter, and widowed bride, stole to</p>
<p class="p1">her own little room to weep in secret, a little over her fault, but a</p>
<p class="p1">great deal over the absence of and the danger about to befall her</p>
<p class="p1">husband.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Dinner was served without Mr. Clifton, Miss Clifton, Zuleime, and the</p>
<p class="p1">Misses Cabell. Mrs. Georgia Clifton alone entertained the newly arrived</p>
<p class="p1">company. This did not occasion remark. Mr. Clifton was known to be</p>
<p class="p1">absent, and it was customary, as I said before, for the bride and her</p>
<p class="p1">attendants to be invisible.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">In the meantime, Carolyn Clifton sat in her chamber—pride, love, regret,</p>
<p class="p1">anger, hope, fear—all good and evil passions striving in her soul, or in</p>
<p class="p1">turn holding the mastery over it. It was drawing near the hour when she</p>
<p class="p1">should commence her bridal toilet, if indeed any bridal array was to be</p>
<p class="p1">assumed that evening. Amidst all her keen anxiety, she dreaded lest some</p>
<p class="p1">one should come in and tell her it was time to dress. What should her</p>
<p class="p1">proud heart permit her to explain to such a one. She need not have</p>
<p class="p1">feared interruption, however.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">The Misses Cabell, her bridesmaids, it is true, sat together in their</p>
<p class="p1">chamber very impatiently awaiting a message from the bride—very</p>
<p class="p1">impatiently, indeed, for after her ceremonious dressing, they had their</p>
<p class="p1">own very elaborate toilet to make. But they would not enter her</p>
<p class="p1">dressing-room unsummoned, or at least until they should receive from</p>
<p class="p1">some member of the family a suggestion that it was now proper to do so.</p>
<p class="p1">And no one thought or remembered to give them the hint.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Mrs. Georgia Clifton—self-convicted of being the originator of all the</p>
<p class="p1">great trouble that had befallen, and the greater that was about to</p>
<p class="p1">befall the house—kept herself as much as possible aloof.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">And Zuleime was as yet too deeply absorbed in the contemplation of her</p>
<p class="p1">own recent bridehood, and the sorrow of her widowhood, to think of</p>
<p class="p1">anything else.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Meanwhile old Mr. Clifton had ridden as for life up to Hardbargain,</p>
<p class="p1">thrown himself from his horse, flung the bridle upon his neck and let</p>
<p class="p1">him go loose, while he himself rushed up the stairs and into the hall,</p>
<p class="p1">and without the ceremony of a rap, burst into the quiet presence of Mrs.</p>
<p class="p1">Clifton as she sat sewing in her shady parlor. She arose calmly to</p>
<p class="p1">receive him; and the very quietness of the lady threw the excited old</p>
<p class="p1">gentleman off his guard, and out of his politeness, and into a rage.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Well, madam!” he exclaimed, throwing his hat down with a thump into a</p>
<p class="p1">chair, and tramping up and down the floor. “_Here’s_ a pretty state of</p>
<p class="p1">affairs!”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Mr. Clifton, you are excited.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Yes, madam, I AM excited!” interrupted the old man—“very _much_</p>
<p class="p1">excited, madam! Very much excited, _indeed_, madam! Where is Archer</p>
<p class="p1">Clifton? tell me that!”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Mr. Clifton, sit down and compose yourself!”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Compose myself! Compose myself with a prospect of three hundred people</p>
<p class="p1">pouring into my house to-night, each one of them agape to see a wedding,</p>
<p class="p1">and to have to tell them there will be no wedding!”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Mr. Clifton, you can’t regret this circumstance more than I do!”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“I _don’t_ regret it at all, ma’am! I rejoice at it, ma’am! I</p>
<p class="p1">congratulate myself and my daughter, ma’am! But I’ll have satisfaction,</p>
<p class="p1">ma’am! I’ll have satisfaction, ma’am!” said the old man, wiping the</p>
<p class="p1">perspiration from his red face.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Satisfaction for what you _rejoice_ at, Mr. Clifton?” inquired the</p>
<p class="p1">lady, smiling at his unreasonable anger with herself.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“I’ll—_yes_—I’ll have satisfaction, ma’am!”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“From whom? From me? Do you intend to call me out as my son’s</p>
<p class="p1">representative? Do you wish to compel me to fight a duel; or to make an</p>
<p class="p1">apology—which?” inquired the lady, coolly.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Dem it, mem, I’ll—I’ll have satisfaction,” exclaimed the old man,</p>
<p class="p1">growing shorter and shorter in his syllables. “I’ll—I’ll write to the</p>
<p class="p1">Colonel of the regiment! I’ll—I’ll make the matter known to the</p>
<p class="p1">Major-General of the Army! I’ll—yes, dem-me! I’ll go to Washington and</p>
<p class="p1">tell the President! I’ll have that young rascal cashiered, and broken</p>
<p class="p1">and dismissed from the service!”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“What! _all three_! Why, that is passing cruel! Quite as bad as being</p>
<p class="p1">killed and murdered, and mortally wounded!” said the lady, smiling at</p>
<p class="p1">his insane vehemence.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Dem it, mem! don’t take my words up!” he exclaimed, stamping up and</p>
<p class="p1">down the floor, and then breaking out into vituperative abuse of Archer</p>
<p class="p1">Clifton, all addressed to Mrs. Clifton, who, though becoming very much</p>
<p class="p1">agitated, now preserved a dignified silence.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Mr. Clifton forgets that he is a man, and that he speaks to a woman!”</p>
<p class="p1">said a stern, but low-toned voice.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">And the old gentleman turned to see Kate Kavanagh, ‘severe in youthful</p>
<p class="p1">beauty,’ standing within the door; yes, in _beauty_, for her slight</p>
<p class="p1">figure was drawn gracefully up—her bosom heaving, her fine head erected,</p>
<p class="p1">her cheeks crimson, and her eyes intensely brilliant with the just</p>
<p class="p1">indignation that moved her soul, as she walked straight up to Mrs.</p>
<p class="p1">Clifton, and said—</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Dearest lady, allow me—_do_ allow me to attend you to your own room,</p>
<p class="p1">and be your substitute here, in waiting upon Mr. Clifton.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“No, Kate—no, my dear girl. I have to talk rationally to the man as soon</p>
<p class="p1">as he comes to his senses,” replied the lady.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“_Who is_ that girl?” inquired the old gentleman, not recognizing Kate</p>
<p class="p1">under the new aspect—or affecting not to do so. “Who _is_ that girl,</p>
<p class="p1">Mrs. Clifton?” he repeated, while the lady gazed fondly on her protégé.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Miss Kavanagh; my son’s ward, and my own adopted daughter,” replied</p>
<p class="p1">Mrs. Clifton, without withdrawing her fond gaze from the face of Kate,</p>
<p class="p1">who was blushing under it.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Miss Kavanagh, your son’s ward, and your own adopted daughter! A</p>
<p class="p1">promising relationship all around, that is—up—on—my—word—it—is!” said</p>
<p class="p1">Mr. Clifton, very deliberately. “However,” he added, “she has brought me</p>
<p class="p1">to reflection, for which I thank her. And Mrs. Clifton, I feel sorry and</p>
<p class="p1">mortified that I have been betrayed into some violence of speech and</p>
<p class="p1">manner; it is a family failing, you know. Pray pardon me.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Mr. Clifton, please to sit down near me. My voice is not strong. It may</p>
<p class="p1">be disquietude, but I find a difficulty in raising it, or in keeping up</p>
<p class="p1">a running conversation.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“My dear sister, I am afraid your lungs grow weak. I am indeed! I have</p>
<p class="p1">noticed it before. I have said the same to Georgia and to Carolyn!</p>
<p class="p1">Indeed, my dear sister Clifton, I wish you would take care of yourself.</p>
<p class="p1">I was a brute to throw myself into a passion in your presence. I was,</p>
<p class="p1">indeed! I see it has overcome you! Kate Kavanagh, my dear, you were</p>
<p class="p1">perfectly right. I _did_ forget myself. And you were a fine girl to</p>
<p class="p1">recall me. Give me your hand, my dear.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Blushing deeply, as was her wont when praised, Kate gave her hand,</p>
<p class="p1">saying—half apologetically, half appealingly—</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Mrs. Clifton is not strong, sir. She should not be agitated, especially</p>
<p class="p1">so soon after her son has left her.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“I know she is not strong! My dear sister, I wish you’d be careful of</p>
<p class="p1">yourself! I do, indeed! You’re not strong.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“After fifty, we do not grow strong as we grow old,” said the lady,</p>
<p class="p1">pointing to a chair by her side, and indicating that he should take it!</p>
<p class="p1">He did so. And then Mrs. Clifton turned to Kate, and said—</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Now Catherine, my dear, I wish you to go up into my chamber and amuse</p>
<p class="p1">yourself with a book, while I have a confidential talk with Mr.</p>
<p class="p1">Clifton.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Kate immediately arose, curtsied, and left the room.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Mrs. Clifton turned to her brother-in-law, and said, inquiringly, “You</p>
<p class="p1">know the cause of this lovers’ quarrel?”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Of course I do, madam! Satan fly away with them both! I know all about</p>
<p class="p1">it! It was about _her_—up stairs!” he replied, indicating Kate Kavanagh</p>
<p class="p1">by a crook of his thumb.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Yes; it was about Kate. But it was very absurd!”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Now, I don’t know that ma’am!”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“But it certainly _was_—ridiculous! Mr. Clifton! _she_, Catherine, knows</p>
<p class="p1">nothing about it! Does not even dream that _she herself_ had the</p>
<p class="p1">remotest connection with the quarrel, and I do hope and trust, that she</p>
<p class="p1">never may suspect it. What I wish to say to you, is plainly this: That I</p>
<p class="p1">know enough of human nature generally, and of young people particularly,</p>
<p class="p1">and of Archer and Carolyn individually, to feel sure that this very</p>
<p class="p1">absurd and extremely inconvenient quarrel and separation—”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Yes, _very_ extremely inconvenient, indeed!” emphatically interrupted</p>
<p class="p1">the old man.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Is only temporary—”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Yes, ma’am, but that don’t make it the less embarrassing—the less</p>
<p class="p1">inconvenient!”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“I know it! Hear me out!”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“What the deuce, ma’am, are we to do with the people who are coming to</p>
<p class="p1">the wedding even now?”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“I am about to tell you, if you will quietly listen to me.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Well! well! Yes, ma’am! I beg your pardon—I am all attention.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Carolyn, I am sure, already regrets her hasty violence of temper.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Yes! that she does! It’s easy to see that!”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“And Archer, who is slower to anger and slower to repentance—though</p>
<p class="p1">deeper and stronger in both for being slow—Archer, in a very few days,</p>
<p class="p1">will bitterly repent the step he has taken, more especially as being on</p>
<p class="p1">his Western march, it will be impossible to retrace it. Under these</p>
<p class="p1">circumstances, this is what you must say to the assembled company</p>
<p class="p1">to-night:—You must tell them, that last night a peremptory order arrived</p>
<p class="p1">for Captain Clifton to join his regiment immediately; and that the</p>
<p class="p1">marriage is deferred for the present. Let the company then enjoy</p>
<p class="p1">themselves as at a ball. And all will go off well, and without scandal.</p>
<p class="p1">I will be present myself, as the representative of our side of the</p>
<p class="p1">house. I sent for you, Mr. Clifton, to give you this advice, and to</p>
<p class="p1">suggest this plan of action in meeting the embarrassing difficulties of</p>
<p class="p1">this evening. I should not propose this, if I were not sure that the</p>
<p class="p1">marriage _is_ only deferred—that if the parties live, it will assuredly</p>
<p class="p1">take place. I am _certain_ it will, Mr. Clifton! I am willing to pledge</p>
<p class="p1">my own truth and honor on it, and become responsible for it! The plan I</p>
<p class="p1">propose to you for meeting the guests this evening, is truest, wisest</p>
<p class="p1">and best—think of it!”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“I do not think of it at all! I see its excellence at a glance. I spring</p>
<p class="p1">to meet it! I embrace it! I hug it to my heart! Oh, Mrs. Clifton, you</p>
<p class="p1">are our deliverer! Oh, Mrs. Clifton! you are the great-grand-daughter of</p>
<p class="p1">Oliver Cromwell, the general, the conqueror, the deliverer, the</p>
<p class="p1">statesman, the politician, the diplomatist, the everything at an</p>
<p class="p1">emergency!—You’ll see how gloriously I’ll execute your orders! You’ll</p>
<p class="p1">make me Lieutenant-General when you are Lady Protector of the</p>
<p class="p1">Commonwealth!” exclaimed the old man, starting up and clapping his hat</p>
<p class="p1">upon his head, and joking like a boy, for very joy that his difficulty</p>
<p class="p1">was smoothed. He shook hands with Mrs. Clifton, begging her not to be</p>
<p class="p1">late, as he should want the encouragement of her presence in order to</p>
<p class="p1">enable him to make his speech. Then he mounted his horse, and rode</p>
<p class="p1">rapidly away down the mountain-path to Clifton. When he arrived at home,</p>
<p class="p1">he found the lawn already covered with carriages, horses and servants,</p>
<p class="p1">and the piazza, halls, and all the first floor rooms, thronged with</p>
<p class="p1">company. He passed through them all, bowing right and left and hastened</p>
<p class="p1">to his daughter’s room. Mr. Clifton had some doubts about getting his</p>
<p class="p1">proud daughter to consent to the wise plan suggested by his</p>
<p class="p1">sister-in-law. But he meant to carry his consent by a coup-de-main. So</p>
<p class="p1">he pushed open her door, burst into her chamber, and threw himself,</p>
<p class="p1">puffing, blowing, and perspiring, into the nearest chair, exclaiming—</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“He’s gone, Carolyn! He’s clear gone, confound him!”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Carolyn drew nearer her father, and gazed into his face, to read there</p>
<p class="p1">the confirmation of what she scarcely could believe. The old man wiped</p>
<p class="p1">his streaming face with his handkerchief, and stuffed it again into his</p>
<p class="p1">pocket, exclaiming—</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Yes! he’s gone! gone! gone! gone!” Then opening wide his arms, he</p>
<p class="p1">murmured, “But never mind, my dear child! you’ve got your old father</p>
<p class="p1">left to love you, and to avenge you, too, if needful! Don’t grieve! Come</p>
<p class="p1">to my bosom! Don’t grieve!”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“‘_Grieve_,’ sir!” exclaimed the imperious girl, elevating her queenly</p>
<p class="p1">head, “we do not _grieve_ for a traitor! We pronounce sentence on him,</p>
<p class="p1">and execute it!”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“True! true! my noble girl! There spoke your mother’s daughter! Yet—”</p>
<p class="p1">suddenly cried the old gentleman, as by a quick recollection and</p>
<p class="p1">revulsion of feeling, “what a devil of a kettle of fish this is, my</p>
<p class="p1">dear! Blame the fellow, what are we to do? Deuce take the man—what are</p>
<p class="p1">we to say to the people down stairs? _Say_, Carolyn! Woman’s wit is</p>
<p class="p1">quick! Can you think of anything?”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Carolyn stood in proud and bitter thought for some minutes, and then she</p>
<p class="p1">smiled, with a scornful smile, and said—</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Do nothing, sir! Let all go on as was planned! Let the band of music</p>
<p class="p1">take its place in the saloon! Let the wedding guests come, and be</p>
<p class="p1">received! And _then_ leave all the rest to me! And now, my dear father,</p>
<p class="p1">pray excuse me, as it is time to dress.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“To dress! Why, Carolyn, what do you mean? Are you mad? Dress for what?”</p>
<p class="p1">asked the old gentleman, anxious to know if perchance _her_ idea in any</p>
<p class="p1">way resembled the plan adopted by himself, from Mrs. Clifton’s</p>
<p class="p1">suggestion.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“No, sir! I am not mad. ‘My pulse, as yours, doth temperately keep</p>
<p class="p1">time,’” said the young lady, extending her hand to the bell-rope, and</p>
<p class="p1">ringing a peal that presently brought her woman hurrying up stairs and</p>
<p class="p1">into her presence.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Darky!” said she addressing her attendant, “go to Miss Zuleime, and to</p>
<p class="p1">the Misses Cabell, and let them know that I have waited for them some</p>
<p class="p1">time.” The old handmaid went out, and Carolyn turned to her father, and</p>
<p class="p1">said, “My dearest father! when I am dressed I will send for you, and we</p>
<p class="p1">will have a conversation, in which I will tell you my simple plan for</p>
<p class="p1">getting through the evening. I have not quite matured it yet! Ah! here</p>
<p class="p1">are the girls! Good evening for a couple of hours, father!”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">She opened the door for her father, who just escaped the young</p>
<p class="p1">bridesmaids, who were coming in.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">He went out muttering—</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“I don’t know what she means. I suppose I can have confidence in her. At</p>
<p class="p1">least I must for the _present_, and then, there is Mrs. Clifton’s plan.”</p>
<p class="p1">He went into his own room and arrayed himself in festive garments for</p>
<p class="p1">the occasion, and then went below stairs to groan inwardly over the</p>
<p class="p1">numerous arrivals of guests, whose carriages thronged the lawn, and</p>
<p class="p1">whose servants crowded the piazza, hall and entries. Presently a servant</p>
<p class="p1">approached him, and said, respectfully, in a low voice—</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Miss Clifton’s compliments, sir, and will see you in her own room.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">The old gentleman hastened thither. He found his daughter ready dressed,</p>
<p class="p1">and quite alone. Her bridesmaids had gone to make their own toilets.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Father!” she said, “I will not wear the willow for a recreant lover! I</p>
<p class="p1">have determined that the festivities shall go on to-night. I will go</p>
<p class="p1">down and lead off the first dance myself. You, my father, may explain,</p>
<p class="p1">as you please, that the marriage is broken off, but that the music,</p>
<p class="p1">dancing, and feasting are not arrested for that reason.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">The old man had determined within himself what to speak but he answered—</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“My dear child, are you _equal_ to it?”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“_Equal sir?_ Try me!”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Very well, my dear. Come! And I will say—what is proper upon the</p>
<p class="p1">occasion.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">In the meanwhile the splendid company assembled in the brilliantly</p>
<p class="p1">lighted saloon, awaited with great impatience the entree of the bridal</p>
<p class="p1">train.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Made conspicuous in that gorgeous assembly by his black gown and bands,</p>
<p class="p1">sat the clergyman who was to perform the ceremony.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Georgia—darkly, resplendently beautiful as ever, moved gracefully</p>
<p class="p1">through the crowd—full of gracious courtesy, yet flushed, anxious,</p>
<p class="p1">feverish—half fearing that the bridegroom would appear at this last</p>
<p class="p1">moment. This fear was aroused by the presence, and the calm, cheerful,</p>
<p class="p1">self-possessed looks of Mrs. Clifton, of Hardbargain. At length light</p>
<p class="p1">steps were heard in the hall. The doors of the saloon where thrown open.</p>
<p class="p1">And all eyes were turned to see the wedding procession enter. But</p>
<p class="p1">instead of a bridal train, came old Mr. Clifton, leading in his daughter</p>
<p class="p1">Carolyn. The surprise, the wonder of the company was at first silent and</p>
<p class="p1">breathless as it was profound. But soon a low whisper arose, and like a</p>
<p class="p1">low breeze in the leaves, passed from one to another, until the room was</p>
<p class="p1">in a general buzz.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Mr. Clifton led his daughter into the centre of the saloon, and with her</p>
<p class="p1">still hanging on his arm, turned and faced the company, waiting until</p>
<p class="p1">they should be silent before he would speak. The father and daughter, as</p>
<p class="p1">they stood there, presented a fine, imposing appearance. Both were</p>
<p class="p1">arrayed with the gorgeous splendor that prevailed at that day.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">The old gentleman had his snow-white hair turned back off his forehead,</p>
<p class="p1">and carried all down to the nape of his neck, where it was plaited into</p>
<p class="p1">a queue, and adorned with a large white satin bow, both snowy plait and</p>
<p class="p1">bow in pleasant relief against the back of the dark crimson velvet</p>
<p class="p1">coat—his vest and small clothes were of white satin, and his long hose</p>
<p class="p1">of white silk were fastened to the small clothes below the knee with</p>
<p class="p1">white satin bows and gold buckles—his slippers were of crimson morocco,</p>
<p class="p1">with high heels, large bows, and gold buckles. His dress was rather</p>
<p class="p1">antiquated even for that day. And he stood there waiting for silence</p>
<p class="p1">with the suave and stately courtesy of the old school gentleman.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Very much like a queen looked the beautiful Carolyn, but very little</p>
<p class="p1">like a bride, either in her dignified self-possession, or in her</p>
<p class="p1">magnificent array. Her fair hair was carried up above her forehead, and</p>
<p class="p1">dressed high, in the regal style of that day. Its rich waves and bands</p>
<p class="p1">were wreathed with pearls, and adorned with a plume of white ostrich</p>
<p class="p1">feathers, powdered with minute silver spangles. Her neck and arms were</p>
<p class="p1">bare, but adorned with pearls, and softly shaded with the finest lace at</p>
<p class="p1">the edge of the boddice and sleeves. Her dress was of rich blue satin</p>
<p class="p1">brocade, made with long waist, sharp pointed stomacher, and flowing</p>
<p class="p1">sleeves and flowing skirt—the edges of the skirt finished with a very</p>
<p class="p1">deep border of silver embroidery; a lighter border of the same running</p>
<p class="p1">around the sleeves; the stomacher was embroidered with silver and</p>
<p class="p1">pearls. Over her skirt she wore a train of splendid lace, lightly</p>
<p class="p1">embroidered with a running vine of silver. She toyed with an elegant fan</p>
<p class="p1">of carved mother-of-pearl and marabout feathers. She stood there, as I</p>
<p class="p1">said, not at all like a bride, either in her gorgeous apparel, or her</p>
<p class="p1">self-asserting manner. She stood there with a gay, proud air, beneath</p>
<p class="p1">which none could have discerned the deeply humiliated spirit of the</p>
<p class="p1">arrogant woman, or suspected the wounded and breaking heart of the</p>
<p class="p1">forsaken bride.—When the murmur of voices which had greeted their</p>
<p class="p1">entrance had subsided, and silence was restored, Mr. Clifton bowed</p>
<p class="p1">deeply, and—in the somewhat high-flown grandiloquence of style he had</p>
<p class="p1">once seen exhibited by a manager of a city theatre, when apologising for</p>
<p class="p1">the non-appearance of the evening’s star—spoke as follows: “Ladies and</p>
<p class="p1">gentlemen, the distinction of your presence here this evening, has been</p>
<p class="p1">prayed that you might give the honor of your countenance to the</p>
<p class="p1">espousals of my nephew and daughter. You have graciously accorded us the</p>
<p class="p1">dignity of your society here for that purpose.” (An embarrassed pause,</p>
<p class="p1">while the assembly listened in breathless curiosity and expectation, and</p>
<p class="p1">he continued,) “Ladies and gentlemen, ‘man _pro_poses, but God</p>
<p class="p1">_dis_poses.’ The great Arbiter of destiny has ordained the issue of</p>
<p class="p1">events otherwise than as we had hoped, planned, and expected. Even last</p>
<p class="p1">night suddenly came a peremptory order from head-quarters, to Captain</p>
<p class="p1">Clifton, to join his regiment instantly for the purpose of taking the</p>
<p class="p1">command of a detachment of cavalry, to march immediately to the Indian</p>
<p class="p1">frontier to put down an irruption of the Shoshowanawas! Ladies and</p>
<p class="p1">gentlemen!” (continued the old gentleman, warming up with his subject,)</p>
<p class="p1">“you know the stern, uncompromising duty of the soldier at such a</p>
<p class="p1">crisis. One syllable—one single syllable comprehends his insupportable</p>
<p class="p1">obligation—‘Go.’ The man, the lover, the bridegroom must give place to</p>
<p class="p1">the soldier. As our greatest poet, Walter Scott, has it,—the soldier at</p>
<p class="p1">the sound of the trumpet must</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">                      </span>“‘Leave untended the herd,</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">                        </span>The flock without shelter,</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">                      </span>The dead uninterred,</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">                        </span>The bride at the altar.’</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Ladies and gentlemen, our gallant Captain Clifton has literally left</p>
<p class="p1">his ‘bride at the altar.’ But soldier’s love may not mourn bridegroom’s</p>
<p class="p1">loss. Nor may we deny ourselves the distinction and joy of your presence</p>
<p class="p1">for the whole night—nor,” (the old man was unconsciously sliding from</p>
<p class="p1">his lofty magniloquence down to the plain vernacular,) “nor must I</p>
<p class="p1">disappoint these young men and maidens of their dance to-night. Ho!</p>
<p class="p1">music there! Strike up the liveliest quadrille air upon your list. Let</p>
<p class="p1">them dance to the briskest music while they are fresh. Charley Cabell,</p>
<p class="p1">my boy, come here and lead out your cousin Carolyn!”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Major Cabell advanced, and with much grace and dignity led Miss Clifton</p>
<p class="p1">to the head of the quadrille, as the music pealed forth.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Young gentlemen, select your partners!” exclaimed the old man, adding</p>
<p class="p1">example to precept, by choosing the youngest and prettiest girl in the</p>
<p class="p1">room, and leading her to the place right opposite his nephew and</p>
<p class="p1">daughter. Soon all the surprise and disappointment were forgotten in</p>
<p class="p1">enjoyment. The evening was spent in the gayest hilarity—Carolyn Clifton,</p>
<p class="p1">the forsaken bride, apparently the gayest of the gay. So gay, indeed,</p>
<p class="p1">was Miss Clifton, that she drew upon herself the severe animadversions</p>
<p class="p1">of several ladies present, who affirmed that her conduct was heartless</p>
<p class="p1">in the extreme; to laugh and sing and dance and jest with such thorough</p>
<p class="p1">abandonment to pleasure, just after the departure of her lover to brave</p>
<p class="p1">the ghastly horrors of Indian warfare. Much more did they approve of the</p>
<p class="p1">pensive manners of Zuleime. Poor Zuleime was all unskilled in</p>
<p class="p1">self-control—her heart was “exceeding sorrowful,” and so she let it</p>
<p class="p1">appear. The company separated at a very late hour that night, or rather</p>
<p class="p1">a very early hour of the next morning. Those in the neighborhood</p>
<p class="p1">departing, those from a distance retiring to the chambers to take some</p>
<p class="p1">sleep before breakfast, after which they were to set out for their</p>
<p class="p1">homes.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">                               </span>CHAPTER X.</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">                              </span>THE SISTERS.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">                  </span>Sister! since I met thee last,</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">                  </span>O’er thy brow a change hath past;</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">                  </span>In the softness of thine eyes,</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">                  </span>Deep and still a shadow lies;</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">                  </span>From thy voice there thrills a tone,</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">                  </span>Never to thy childhood known;</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">                  </span>Through thy soul a storm hath moved,</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">                  </span>——Gentle sister, thou hath loved.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Overtasked, weary and exhausted by her long efforts, Carolyn Clifton</p>
<p class="p1">sought her own chamber, and threw herself, all splendidly arrayed as she</p>
<p class="p1">was, upon her bed. She had no fear of interruption, for it was not yet</p>
<p class="p1">daybreak, and her woman would not be up for several hours. So she was</p>
<p class="p1">surprised, and not at all pleased when a gentle rap came to the door.</p>
<p class="p1">She would not answer or move to let the rapper know that she was awake.</p>
<p class="p1">She was weary, weary with acting for one night, and needed rest. But</p>
<p class="p1">after the unknown had rapped two or three times, the door was gently</p>
<p class="p1">opened, and the sweet voice of Zuleime was heard to say—</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Sister, I know you are not asleep—will you let me come in?” And without</p>
<p class="p1">waiting for an answer, she entered, and softly closed the door, and came</p>
<p class="p1">to the bedside, saying—“I heard you when you came up and threw yourself</p>
<p class="p1">down on the bed, and I knew you were not asleep—let me stay with you,</p>
<p class="p1">dear sister, won’t you?”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“No, no, Zuleime, I wish to sleep,” said Carolyn, still pressing both</p>
<p class="p1">hands to her throbbing temples.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Well, then, dear Carolyn, let me undress you, you can never compose</p>
<p class="p1">yourself in that dress;” and the affectionate girl began to take off her</p>
<p class="p1">slippers and stockings, saying—“I can take off all the small articles,</p>
<p class="p1">and unlace your stomacher without disturbing you, sister, and then you</p>
<p class="p1">need not stand up more than a minute to disrobe.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">In indifference or abstraction, Miss Clifton permitted the gentle girl</p>
<p class="p1">to unclasp all her jewels, and loosen her dress, without ever removing</p>
<p class="p1">her hands, clasped tightly upon her temples, till Zuleime, wishing to</p>
<p class="p1">take down the elaborate _coiffure_, gently withdrew them, and unwound</p>
<p class="p1">the strings of pearls, and unfastened the plume of feathers. When the</p>
<p class="p1">affectionate girl had laid aside all these glittering gewgaws, and freed</p>
<p class="p1">her long, fair hair, and relieved her oppressed and fevered head, the</p>
<p class="p1">proud and scornful Carolyn, subdued by the gentleness of her sweet, only</p>
<p class="p1">sister, looked in her face, read there a strange sympathy, delicate as</p>
<p class="p1">it was deep, and suddenly put her arms around her neck, drew her head</p>
<p class="p1">down to her own, and kissed her fondly, murmuring—</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Oh, Zuleime! my child, my child! if you knew—”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“I _do_ know, dearest Carolyn! Dearest sister, I _do_ know it all! all!</p>
<p class="p1">and feel it—feel it from the bottom of my heart! That is the reason I</p>
<p class="p1">came in, Carolyn! But I did not come in to disturb you, even by my</p>
<p class="p1">sympathy. I came in to put you to sleep. Stand up, dearest Carolyn, and</p>
<p class="p1">drop these heavy robes, and I will throw this light wrapper around you,</p>
<p class="p1">and then you can lie down again—there!”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Oh! sleep!—when shall I sleep again?” bitterly asked Carolyn, as</p>
<p class="p1">Zuleime laid her head tenderly back upon the freshened pillow.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Well, don’t talk, dear Carolyn, and you will see that God will send</p>
<p class="p1">sleep.” And Zuleime cooled her brow by passing over it several times a</p>
<p class="p1">lump of ice in a napkin, and laid down by her side, and fanned her, in</p>
<p class="p1">that measured, monotonous time, so inducive to slumber. So slowly she</p>
<p class="p1">fanned her, resisting all her attempts to enter into conversation, until</p>
<p class="p1">wearied nature yielded, and Carolyn was asleep. Then, as it was morning,</p>
<p class="p1">Zuleime hoisted the windows, to admit a fresh current of air, but left</p>
<p class="p1">the blinds closed, to exclude the light. Next, she put all Carolyn’s</p>
<p class="p1">things carefully away, and silently restored the room to order. Then she</p>
<p class="p1">laid a folded napkin, dipped in ice water, over the still burning brow,</p>
<p class="p1">and cautiously left the room, to go and order tea and toast to be ready</p>
<p class="p1">for Carolyn as soon as she should awake. She found the house below</p>
<p class="p1">stairs in a great but comparatively silent bustle. The servants, who had</p>
<p class="p1">scarcely retired the night previous, were engaged in clearing away the</p>
<p class="p1">disorder of the saloon, parlor and dining-room, and in laying the cloth</p>
<p class="p1">for breakfast for the numerous visitors who had remained over night.</p>
<p class="p1">Zuleime passed on to the kitchen, and gave her orders, and then silently</p>
<p class="p1">stole up stairs again to her sister’s room.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Carolyn slept long and heavily. Several hours passed before she awoke.</p>
<p class="p1">When she opened her eyes, and fixed them gratefully upon Zuleime, she</p>
<p class="p1">raised her arms, again embraced her, saying—</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“You have comforted me, dear Zuleime.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“And I will comfort you more, dear sister. I know how to do it. How do</p>
<p class="p1">you feel, Carolyn?”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Better—my head clearer—my nerves steadier—but a weary weight at my</p>
<p class="p1">heart.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“It shall go away, Carolyn. I know how to drive it away. But first you</p>
<p class="p1">must take something.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">And Zuleime rang the bell, and told the servant who appeared, to bring</p>
<p class="p1">Miss Carolyn some _fresh_ tea and toast.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">While he was gone after it, Zuleime bathed her sister’s face and hands,</p>
<p class="p1">and combed out her hair, and by the time she was made comfortable, the</p>
<p class="p1">servant re-appeared with the refreshments.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">After Carolyn had breakfasted lightly, (and this was the first food she</p>
<p class="p1">had taken for thirty-six hours,) she fell exhausted back upon her</p>
<p class="p1">pillow, and said—</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“I cannot appear this morning, Zuleime! I am tired of acting a part!”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“You need not do it, dear Carolyn! The people have breakfasted, and are</p>
<p class="p1">almost all gone—and the others are going. Carolyn, dear, I saw _Archer_</p>
<p class="p1">when he went away—”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Miss Clifton was still too proud to make a comment.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Carolyn, he looked broken-hearted, despairing—indeed he did! Oh,</p>
<p class="p1">Carolyn! I think if he could have hoped that you would have made up with</p>
<p class="p1">him, he would have let his regiment go to perdition rather than not</p>
<p class="p1">hastened to your feet!”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Why did he not try, then?”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Oh, sister, you banished him, and men have some pride. He waited for</p>
<p class="p1">your relenting, I feel sure!”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Carolyn remembered, with bitter regret, her refusal to let her father go</p>
<p class="p1">and recall him.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Carolyn, write to him. The detachment under his command does not march</p>
<p class="p1">from Winchester for nine days yet. Write, Carolyn—there is abundant time</p>
<p class="p1">for him to get your letter and answer it before he goes. Then you will</p>
<p class="p1">be reconciled and happy. Everything will be restored, and you will</p>
<p class="p1">comfort yourself by remembering that he would have had to have gone, any</p>
<p class="p1">way, and that he is gone reconciled!”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Miss Clifton shook her head.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“No, Zuleime! I cannot! I should not know _how_ to write such a letter!</p>
<p class="p1">What could I say to him?”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Say! _I_ should know what to say! If you have banished him, revoke your</p>
<p class="p1">sentence of exile. If you have ascertained that you have done him</p>
<p class="p1">injustice, tell him so. If you are sorry that you parted in anger, let</p>
<p class="p1">him know it. If you wish to hear from him before he goes, ask him to</p>
<p class="p1">write to you.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“I could not!—I could not! I never could write such a letter! My</p>
<p class="p1">heart-strings would crack in the attempt.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“And are you _so_ proud? And will you let him go forth to that ghastly</p>
<p class="p1">Indian war—oh, God! my flesh creeps only to think of it!” said Zuleime,</p>
<p class="p1">shuddering. “And will you not retract your false accusation, and revoke</p>
<p class="p1">your cruel sentence of banishment, and express kind feelings and kind</p>
<p class="p1">wishes for him about to be exposed to such horrors?”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“I can’t! I can’t! I _cannot_! My heart-strings would snap with the</p>
<p class="p1">effort! I can bear sorrow, but not humiliation! I can die, but I cannot</p>
<p class="p1">be humbled!”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“You cannot be humbled by an act of justice, sister. That letter would</p>
<p class="p1">be only an act of justice. And, oh! it would give him such happiness,</p>
<p class="p1">and bring you such sweet peace, in place of all this heart-burning.</p>
<p class="p1">Think of it, dear Carolyn!”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">While Zuleime spoke, a rap was heard at the door, and a servant</p>
<p class="p1">appeared, and said that “Marster wished to see Miss Zuleime in the</p>
<p class="p1">parlor.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Think of it, dear Carolyn,” said Zuleime, in a cheerful voice, kissing</p>
<p class="p1">her sister’s forehead, and then hastening out of the room.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Carolyn _did_ think of it! The idea once presented, she could not banish</p>
<p class="p1">it again;—the hope of a reconciliation once raised, could not be</p>
<p class="p1">suppressed! She could think of nothing else. “It was but an act of</p>
<p class="p1">common justice—it was a duty,” she repeated to herself, many times, to</p>
<p class="p1">answer the objections of her pride, which argued, “It is undignified,</p>
<p class="p1">unwomanly, to make this overture.” Then her love, her benevolence, her</p>
<p class="p1">fears for him, pleaded, “It will make him so happy—it will fill his</p>
<p class="p1">heart with courage, and his arm with strength for the battle! And</p>
<p class="p1">suppose he should be killed?—what intolerable remorse will be added to</p>
<p class="p1">your sorrow for him when you reflect that he died without a relenting</p>
<p class="p1">word from you, who have been so cruelly unjust to him! That he died</p>
<p class="p1">under your own sentence of exile! Besides, if none of these things</p>
<p class="p1">happen, can _you_ bear these weary, weary days of estrangement, absence,</p>
<p class="p1">and suspense?—weary, weary days, that will slowly, slowly drag</p>
<p class="p1">themselves through weeks, and months, and years of time?” Oh, no! No,</p>
<p class="p1">no! She cannot bear that prospect! She will be just—she will do her</p>
<p class="p1">duty, and satisfy her affection at the same time. _Down, pride!_ for she</p>
<p class="p1">will write that letter. She did write it. She did not read it over</p>
<p class="p1">again, lest scorn should rise and compel her to hurl it down and set her</p>
<p class="p1">heel upon it. She set her teeth almost grimly in her determination to</p>
<p class="p1">protect that gentle, loving missive of sorrow and affection from an</p>
<p class="p1">assault of her besetting sin, as she sealed and directed it. She then</p>
<p class="p1">slipped on her dressing-gown, and stole down the back stairs, where she</p>
<p class="p1">found a boy lounging. She ordered him to saddle a horse immediately, and</p>
<p class="p1">take that letter to the post-office. Nay, she waited till she saw the</p>
<p class="p1">boy off, and was sure that none had seen him or the letter he carried.</p>
<p class="p1">Then she returned to her own room, determining that no soul—not her</p>
<p class="p1">father—not even Zuleime, should share her confidence and know her</p>
<p class="p1">condescension.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">                     </span>MRS. FAIRFAX AND MAJOR CABELL.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">               </span>A father suffering, and a step-dame false,</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">               </span>A foolish suitor to a wedded lady.</p>

<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Zuleime went into the parlor and found her father alone. He was sitting</p>
<p class="p1">in an easy-chair, doing nothing, but apparently waiting for her.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Come hither, Zuleime,” he said.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">And when she went up to him, he drew her upon his knee, and passed his</p>
<p class="p1">left arm around her waist, while, with his right hand, he smoothed her</p>
<p class="p1">black hair.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">And he gazed fondly in her face. He noticed that her cheek was pale, and</p>
<p class="p1">her countenance pensive, but hoped that it was from the excitement of</p>
<p class="p1">the night before. He could not bear to think of its being regret for</p>
<p class="p1">Frank. He feared to ask her the cause of her seriousness. He disliked to</p>
<p class="p1">recall Frank in any manner to her recollection. He wished her to forget</p>
<p class="p1">him, if possible. At least, _he_ would do so.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Zuleime,” he said, after he had stroked her hair some time, “you know,</p>
<p class="p1">my love, that your aunt Cabell, and your cousins, are going back to</p>
<p class="p1">Richmond to-day.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Are they, sir? I did not know it,” said Zuleime, turning paler, with</p>
<p class="p1">apprehension of something that might be coming.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Yes, my dear, they are. And, Zuleime—” here he paused—then he went on,</p>
<p class="p1">“you have been thinking, I suppose, that you should have to return with</p>
<p class="p1">them, to enter upon your school duties again, as the first of September</p>
<p class="p1">is so near.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“I had not thought of it, sir! So many things happening, put it out of</p>
<p class="p1">my head. But I am quite willing to go, and can be ready in half an</p>
<p class="p1">hour.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Thank you, my dear child. I am very glad to see you so prompt to oblige</p>
<p class="p1">me; but, my dear Zuleime, I have good news for you.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Good news, sir?”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Yes, girl! the best news! the _very_ best news! news that young ladies</p>
<p class="p1">always rejoice to hear!”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“What news, sir?” she asked, fearfully.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Don’t whine, girl! it is not your sentence of death! It is your deed of</p>
<p class="p1">emancipation! Your ‘free papers,’ as the niggers would say. You are not</p>
<p class="p1">to return to school any more! Are you not surprised? Are you not</p>
<p class="p1">rejoiced now?”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Zuleime was not. She was anxious, foreboding.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Why don’t you speak, my dear? Ain’t you glad you’re not going back to</p>
<p class="p1">school, to leather shoulder braces and back boards, and square and</p>
<p class="p1">compass rules and regulations, that mean nothing, unless they mean</p>
<p class="p1">persecution and torture! Say, ain’t you glad?”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“I think I had rather go back to school for the present, sir.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Nonsense, now, my dear! Ah! I see how it is! You want to return with</p>
<p class="p1">your dear aunt Cabell, and the dear city cousins—especially cousin</p>
<p class="p1">Charley! Eh, you monkey! You grow tired of the country and your old</p>
<p class="p1">father, as soon as ever your aunt and cousins talk about returning to</p>
<p class="p1">the city! Ah! you rogue,” said the old man, chucking her under the chin,</p>
<p class="p1">and devoutly praying that he might be right in his conjecture—for, oh!</p>
<p class="p1">that child’s happiness! It lay nearer his heart than anything else on</p>
<p class="p1">earth or in heaven.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Dear father!” she said, embracing him, “I do not wish to leave you,</p>
<p class="p1">indeed I do not. I prefer the country. And I had rather _never_ leave</p>
<p class="p1">you, or my home.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Dear little rogue, now don’t tell me that! I know better you know! And</p>
<p class="p1">it is quite natural, and nobody blames you. The young bird must leave</p>
<p class="p1">its nest, and the young girl her home, when she becomes a wife. Your</p>
<p class="p1">mother left her parents and came home here with her husband. So do not</p>
<p class="p1">think, my love, that your old father will charge you with selfishness</p>
<p class="p1">for wishing to leave him—no, not wishing to _leave him_, but wishing to</p>
<p class="p1">go with one who is to be your husband.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Zuleime dropped her head, to conceal the deadly pallor that crept over</p>
<p class="p1">her face.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Yes, dear Zuleime, you will soon return to Richmond, though it will be</p>
<p class="p1">not as a school-girl—but as a happy bride—as Mrs. Major Cabell! What a</p>
<p class="p1">sonorous name and title for my little, romping Zuleime! Here, Charley</p>
<p class="p1">Cabell! I have broken the ice, now come and speak for yourself!”</p>
<p class="p1">exclaimed Mr. Clifton to Major Cabell, who was going by the door. Major</p>
<p class="p1">Cabell came in, passing the old gentleman, who had seized his hat, and</p>
<p class="p1">not trusting himself to look at his daughter, rushed out of the room.</p>
<p class="p1">Zuleime remained standing where he had placed her, when he put her off</p>
<p class="p1">his knee—panic struck—stupid—until Major Cabell took her hand, and</p>
<p class="p1">attempted to lead her to a seat, then snatching her hand away with a</p>
<p class="p1">shudder, she asked almost wildly—</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Cousin Charles, when does father want this marriage to come off?”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“As soon as my dearest Zuleime will consent to make me the happiest of</p>
<p class="p1">men!” replied the common-place wooer, attempting to re-capture her hand,</p>
<p class="p1">but she retreated shuddering, and asking, in a frantic tone and manner,</p>
<p class="p1">in great contrast to her calm words—</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Cousin Charles, do me a favor! Do not press this matter for a week or</p>
<p class="p1">so.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Heaven forbid that I should hurry a lady, though that lady be my own</p>
<p class="p1">little cousin and betrothed—only fix the day and I will rest content—so</p>
<p class="p1">that it is not a far distant day,” he said, re-capturing her hand,</p>
<p class="p1">throwing his arm around her waist, and drawing her towards him.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Please, don’t! Let me go, cousin Charles!” exclaimed the girl, in great</p>
<p class="p1">distress, struggling to free herself.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“‘Please, don’t let me go, cousin Charles!’ I don’t intend to, pretty</p>
<p class="p1">cousin, until you tell me when you will give yourself to me!” replied</p>
<p class="p1">Major Cabell, kissing her all the more heartily because she strove to</p>
<p class="p1">escape.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“You know what I meant! Let me alone! It is unmanly to behave so! Don’t</p>
<p class="p1">make me hate you!” was on her quivering lips and in her flashing eyes,</p>
<p class="p1">as by a sudden effort she threw his arms off and sat down; but then she</p>
<p class="p1">recollected her father, and the cruel power Major Cabell seemed to</p>
<p class="p1">possess over him, and she choked down the indignant words, and said</p>
<p class="p1">instead—</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Please, don’t hurry and worry me, cousin Charles!—this is so very</p>
<p class="p1">sudden! I am sure I never dreamed you would ask for poor me for years to</p>
<p class="p1">come yet. I am so young.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“‘So young!’ Ah, Zuleime, that is a piece of pretty little womanish</p>
<p class="p1">hypocrisy—a little finesse that belongs to your character, and is</p>
<p class="p1">inherited from your French mother! ‘So young!’ Now, my pretty childish</p>
<p class="p1">cousin, you know you have received an offer of marriage this very week!</p>
<p class="p1">And that, indeed, has accelerated my proposal. Fair Zuleime, a man does</p>
<p class="p1">not care to see his young betrothed bride courted by another!”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“_I know that!_” replied Zuleime, in a peculiarly sad voice, moving to</p>
<p class="p1">the other end of the room.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">The slightest gesture of avoidance of him by the girl, seemed to act as</p>
<p class="p1">a provocative on him, so he followed her, and clasped her in his arms,</p>
<p class="p1">and laughing, almost rudely kissed her, begging her between the kisses</p>
<p class="p1">not to set his heart on fire by her charming prudery and petulance, but</p>
<p class="p1">to fix the day, like a good, sensible girl as she was. Almost frantic</p>
<p class="p1">with rage and shame at being so freely handled, the Clifton blood rushed</p>
<p class="p1">to her brain, and forgetting her father’s interest and everything else,</p>
<p class="p1">she dashed her hand violently into his face, and before he recovered</p>
<p class="p1">from his astonishment, broke from him and escaped—her heart beating with</p>
<p class="p1">one thought—one sudden, joyous thought—that come what might, she never</p>
<p class="p1">could be either forced or persuaded into a marriage with Major Cabell,</p>
<p class="p1">because she was already a wedded wife—no set of circumstances, whatever,</p>
<p class="p1">could make it her duty, or make it even possible for her to marry Major</p>
<p class="p1">Cabell. In all her sorrows, that was one blessed truth to sit down and</p>
<p class="p1">rest upon. All her duty was now due to her husband. And with a youthful</p>
<p class="p1">wife’s enthusiasm firing and strengthening her heart, she thought she</p>
<p class="p1">should stand as upon a rock, secure against a sea of troubles. Poor</p>
<p class="p1">child, she had yet to learn that no position founded on a fault is for a</p>
<p class="p1">moment safe. Several things soon forced themselves upon her memory and</p>
<p class="p1">grieved her heart;—her father’s unknown but certain danger, her own</p>
<p class="p1">promise of secrecy in regard to her marriage, the necessity of giving</p>
<p class="p1">some definite answer to Major Cabell, and the obligation pressing upon</p>
<p class="p1">her to prevent, by all and any means, the highly improper and extremely</p>
<p class="p1">offensive demonstrations of passion from her suitor. She determined to</p>
<p class="p1">write to Frank, tell him all that had occurred, and ask his advice and</p>
<p class="p1">direction; and to do this it was necessary to gain time, and to give no</p>
<p class="p1">false promise in the interim. Already was Zuleime beginning to taste the</p>
<p class="p1">bitter fruits of her stolen marriage, and might have exclaimed, in the</p>
<p class="p1">perplexity of her distracted heart and brain—</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">                   </span>Oh, what a tangled web we weave,</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">                   </span>When first we venture to deceive.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">While Zuleime’s heart was beating so fast with many emotions, her father</p>
<p class="p1">sauntered into the parlor, where he found Major Cabell caressing and</p>
<p class="p1">soothing his afflicted face.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Well, Charley, boy! How is it with you, eh? Could you win a hearing</p>
<p class="p1">from my little girl, eh? Give her time, you know, eh?” said the old</p>
<p class="p1">gentleman, affecting a lightness of heart which he was very far from</p>
<p class="p1">feeling.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">To his surprise, Major Cabell laughed heartily, still coaxing his</p>
<p class="p1">ill-used phiz.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“What’s the matter, Charley? What’s amused you, eh?”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Your girl! By my soul, Governor, I shall end in falling seriously in</p>
<p class="p1">love with that girl! I didn’t fancy her much at first to tell you the</p>
<p class="p1">truth! She was entirely too good humored—always laughing. And I had a</p>
<p class="p1">fancy for marrying a shrew, just for the spicy fun of taming one! The</p>
<p class="p1">same instinct, Governor, that makes me like to spring upon the back of</p>
<p class="p1">the most vicious horse I can find, and ride and lash and spur and</p>
<p class="p1">fatigue the soul out of his body, until I break his back or his temper,</p>
<p class="p1">one—eh, Governor?”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">The old man’s florid cheeks became pale with rage, and he felt an</p>
<p class="p1">impulse to kick the puppy out, but a terrible necessity tied his tongue</p>
<p class="p1">and hands, and Charles Cabell went on laughing and talking to this</p>
<p class="p1">effect:—</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Now, then, having a fancy to marry and tame a shrew—real live, vicious,</p>
<p class="p1">beautiful vixen—I did not want the spiciest part of the sport taken out</p>
<p class="p1">of my hands by fathers and mothers and pastors and masters. I shouldn’t</p>
<p class="p1">have thanked any of you for presenting me with a model wife, already</p>
<p class="p1">smoothed down and polished to my hand. D—n your pretty pieces of</p>
<p class="p1">perfection! I’ll none of them—flat, insipid nonentities!—formed and</p>
<p class="p1">_re_-formed, and modelled, and _re_-modelled, and rubbed down and</p>
<p class="p1">polished until they all look as much alike as beads on a string! No,</p>
<p class="p1">none of your polished gems for Charles Cabell!—the bright, pure, rough,</p>
<p class="p1">sharp ore! Now, of Zuleime, I thought her far too much educated—too good</p>
<p class="p1">humored, too polite, too docile, too much of the young ‘lady,’ too</p>
<p class="p1">little of the wild young animal—and flat and insipid in consequence; so</p>
<p class="p1">I cared very little about her. But, ha, ha, ha! I never was more</p>
<p class="p1">mistaken in my life! She’s a prize, I tell you! A prize of the first</p>
<p class="p1">class! Look you! I coveted a shrew! I’ve found a virago! full of blood</p>
<p class="p1">and fire! strong and vicious, I tell you! ha, ha, ha! Think of her</p>
<p class="p1">dashing her little hand in my face when I went to kiss her, and before I</p>
<p class="p1">recovered my eyesight and senses, throwing me off as if I had been a</p>
<p class="p1">child, and escaping! Ha, ha, ha! I under-estimated her strength!—Never</p>
<p class="p1">mind! let the little tigress look out for the next time I get her in my</p>
<p class="p1">arms!”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">The old man’s bosom was filled to bursting with suppressed passion, but</p>
<p class="p1">he answered, calmly—</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Oh! she’s young—she’s young, a spoiled child—a spoiled child; be</p>
<p class="p1">patient with her—she means well—give her time—be patient with her.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“‘Patient, with her!’ Why, uncle, I wouldn’t have her a bit different</p>
<p class="p1">from what she is! She’s charming, delightful, piquant, spicy! ‘Patient</p>
<p class="p1">with her!’ Why, Gov’, I shall end in falling desperately in love with</p>
<p class="p1">her! But I say, nunc! make the little virago fix our marriage day, will</p>
<p class="p1">you? I have got to go out now and have Spitfire saddled; those fellows</p>
<p class="p1">never draw the girth tight enough, or fix the bit firm enough—and I have</p>
<p class="p1">to pull her head off to stop her sometimes, for she is the foul fiend</p>
<p class="p1">incarnate when she gets to running. I’ll make Zule ride her sometime, to</p>
<p class="p1">see which will get the better of the other. Say, Gov’, let me have my</p>
<p class="p1">answer when I get back—do you hear.” And seizing up his riding-whip and</p>
<p class="p1">cracking it against his boots, he went out.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">The old man boiled over—he clenched his teeth, and shook his fist—nay,</p>
<p class="p1">shook his whole person, as he turned livid with rage; then his arms fell</p>
<p class="p1">helplessly by his side—he sank into a chair—dropped his face upon his</p>
<p class="p1">hands, and groaned aloud. He felt a pair of arms encircling his neck,</p>
<p class="p1">and a sweet voice murmuring in his ear—and he raised his head to see</p>
<p class="p1">Zuleime, and to hear her ask in loving tones—</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Father, what is it?”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">He put his hand tenderly around her waist, and drew her gently to his</p>
<p class="p1">knee, and said, while he gazed remorsefully into her face—</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“I am a villain, Zuleime! A hoary-headed villain!”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Zuleime placed her hand upon his mouth to stop the dreadful words, and</p>
<p class="p1">pressed her lips to his brow, with a look and manner of the profoundest</p>
<p class="p1">love and veneration.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Yes, a hardened, persevering sinner, Zuleime! For I intend to</p>
<p class="p1">persevere! I intend to give you to Charley Cabell, my child,” he said,</p>
<p class="p1">gently removing her hand, and still gazing on her. He continued—“I love</p>
<p class="p1">you so much, Zuleime! I love you so much! But, dear child. He’s coming!</p>
<p class="p1">Dear child, tell me when you will marry Charley—Tuesday three weeks or</p>
<p class="p1">four weeks? Don’t let it be longer than four weeks, my girl!”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Father! will you tell me _why_ you wish me to marry cousin Charles?”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“I cannot! I cannot! _My child_, I cannot. It is for your good, I hope!</p>
<p class="p1">Some day I will, perhaps. Tell me now, _that’s_ a good girl. What day</p>
<p class="p1">will you give this little hand to cousin Charley?”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Father, I can’t possibly give an answer for a week yet, indeed, father,</p>
<p class="p1">I cannot!”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Come, now, nonsense, my child; why can’t you? Here is Charley now!</p>
<p class="p1">come!”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“I cannot, father!”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">The old gentleman kissed, and coaxed, and almost wept; a manner of</p>
<p class="p1">attack so hard to be resisted, that had Zuleime been really free, she</p>
<p class="p1">would have sacrificed her own and Frank’s hopes, and yielded. But</p>
<p class="p1">Zuleime was not free, and therefore was as firmly proof against</p>
<p class="p1">persuasion, as she would have been against force. Two powerful motives</p>
<p class="p1">operated in preventing her from confessing her marriage—first her</p>
<p class="p1">promise to keep it secret, and then the fear of precipitating some</p>
<p class="p1">violent scene between her father and cousin, or some fatal catastrophe</p>
<p class="p1">to the household. To end the conflict, and to gain time to consult</p>
<p class="p1">Frank, by writing, was what she most wished now. Finally, she promised</p>
<p class="p1">to give Major Cabell his answer in a week, and to marry him—_if she</p>
<p class="p1">should ever marry anybody_.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">With this promise, Major Cabell seemed satisfied—and with his mother and</p>
<p class="p1">sisters took leave of Clifton. And Zuleime retired to her own room, full</p>
<p class="p1">of self-reproach for her own deception.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>

<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">A weary week passed away. Zuleime had written to Frank, and Carolyn, we</p>
<p class="p1">already know, had despatched a letter to Archer. But the week had passed</p>
<p class="p1">away, and no answer to either had come from Winchester. Had the sisters</p>
<p class="p1">confided in each other, such mutual confidence might have soothed the</p>
<p class="p1">soul-sickening anxiety of _one_ at least. Carolyn would have known that</p>
<p class="p1">some accident _must_ have prevented Frank Fairfax from receiving or</p>
<p class="p1">answering the momentous letter of his youthful wife, and she would have</p>
<p class="p1">felt that the same cause had probably operated in the case of Archer</p>
<p class="p1">Clifton. But the sisters did not entrust their secrets to each other.</p>
<p class="p1">Zuleime was withheld by her sacred promise. Carolyn by her pride. But</p>
<p class="p1">the wife bore the pain of suspense far better than the maiden. The wife</p>
<p class="p1">had perfect faith in her young husband, and knew that some adverse</p>
<p class="p1">chance had hindered his getting or replying to her letter. The maiden</p>
<p class="p1">knew that she had unjustly banished her lover. And she had no faith in</p>
<p class="p1">the love that endureth all things. Carolyn had never suspected the depth</p>
<p class="p1">of that calm, secure, habitual affection—which had from childhood</p>
<p class="p1">grown—until now. While life and love and hope had flowed smoothly on,</p>
<p class="p1">her emotions were serene and moderate. But now that the quiet stream had</p>
<p class="p1">been stemmed by rocks and breakers, it was lashed into fury and roared</p>
<p class="p1">in whirlpools. The calm sentiment rose to turbulent, maddening passion.</p>
<p class="p1">Her days were restless, her nights sleepless, until, as the week wore</p>
<p class="p1">away, her nerves were wrought to such severity of tension, that you</p>
<p class="p1">might know that at the end of uncertainty, whether that were joy or</p>
<p class="p1">sorrow, they must alike suddenly give way. Towards the last of the week,</p>
<p class="p1">she had privately besought her father to ride to Winchester, and see the</p>
<p class="p1">detachment off, and bring her the last news of it. The request had been</p>
<p class="p1">confidential—yet do you feel all that it had cost her haughty heart?</p>
<p class="p1">During the absence of Mr. Clifton, suspense was wrought up to agony. Her</p>
<p class="p1">days and nights were feverish, delirious, and so confused into each</p>
<p class="p1">other, that she scarcely knew the fitful, disturbed visions of the</p>
<p class="p1">night, from the wild and anxious broodings of the day. The day upon</p>
<p class="p1">which her father was expected back, was the acme, the crisis of her</p>
<p class="p1">suffering. Oblivious of pride and caution, careless of exposing herself</p>
<p class="p1">to the malign sneers of Georgia, or the rude comments of the servants,</p>
<p class="p1">she sat in the piazza, watching the road by which the carriage should</p>
<p class="p1">come—one wild, anxious, despairing hope possessing her. “The drowning</p>
<p class="p1">catch at straws”—and she, in her despair, had clutched one mad</p>
<p class="p1">possibility, and clung to it, until to her weakened, confused, insane</p>
<p class="p1">soul, it seemed a probability, and then almost a certainty. It was the</p>
<p class="p1">hope that Clifton might return with her father! Oh, yes! That Clifton</p>
<p class="p1">might resign his commission and come back to her. Oh! if indeed he loved</p>
<p class="p1">her, as he had a thousand times sworn, if he sorrowed over their</p>
<p class="p1">estrangement only half as much as she did, no hope of glory, no fear of</p>
<p class="p1">disgrace would keep him back. The more she brooded over this, the more</p>
<p class="p1">likely, the more certain it appeared to be. And she sat and gazed up the</p>
<p class="p1">dim forest road.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">The sun sank to the edge of the horizon, and lit up all the mountain</p>
<p class="p1">tops with fire, and then went down. And when she could no longer see,</p>
<p class="p1">she still sat and strained her ear to catch the distant sound of wheels.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">The moon arose, and flooded all the mountain scenery with silver light,</p>
<p class="p1">and flashed upon that distant bend of the river, until it seemed a</p>
<p class="p1">silver lake, lying among the dark hills, and pointed the peaks of White</p>
<p class="p1">Cliffs, until they stood up and glittered, like an enormous row of</p>
<p class="p1">spears, against the deep blue sky.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">At last, at last the very distant sound of wheels came faintly like a</p>
<p class="p1">doubt to her ear, and faded away again. Then it came more distinctly,</p>
<p class="p1">nearer, and a moving object appeared upon the road. And she knew indeed</p>
<p class="p1">it was her father’s carriage. She saw and recognized it in the moon</p>
<p class="p1">light. It turned into the lawn gate, rolled rapidly around the circular</p>
<p class="p1">drive, and swept swiftly up to the entrance, where it stopped. The steps</p>
<p class="p1">were let down, the door opened, and old Mr. Clifton got out, followed</p>
<p class="p1">by—no one.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Carolyn had bent eagerly, unconsciously forward; now she started up and</p>
<p class="p1">caught her father’s hand, and gazed silently, imploringly into his face,</p>
<p class="p1">for the news she could not ask for.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“The detachment has marched, my dear child! Marched the morning of the</p>
<p class="p1">day upon which I reached Winchester, and two days before it was expected</p>
<p class="p1">to have gone. So, you see, I could not get a sight of either Frank or</p>
<p class="p1">Archer. They were thirty miles on their road before I reached the city.</p>
<p class="p1">Can’t think what could have been the reason of the new order, to</p>
<p class="p1">anticipate their departure by two days. However! cheer up! No use</p>
<p class="p1">fretting, my dear! No use fretting! The family have supped long ago, of</p>
<p class="p1">course—have they kept my supper hot for me? I am as hungry as an old</p>
<p class="p1">wolf,” said the old man.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Carolyn did not hear him. Her hold relaxed upon his arm, her hands flew</p>
<p class="p1">up to her head, and she turned, as one struck with sudden blindness, and</p>
<p class="p1">tottered into the house. It was so dark in the shady piazza, screened</p>
<p class="p1">from the moonbeams by interlacing cypress vines, that the old man did</p>
<p class="p1">not see her state. He hastened into the house, where another awaited him</p>
<p class="p1">with equal anxiety.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Zuleime’s private hope had been that Frank would seize the opportunity</p>
<p class="p1">of Mr. Clifton’s visit, and confess his marriage, and invent some way of</p>
<p class="p1">delivering her father from the toils of Major Cabell.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“What news, father?” she asked, meeting him in the hall.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“‘What news?’ Why, I am as hungry as a bear, my pet! That’s the news! I</p>
<p class="p1">stopped to supper at L——. But, my life! They like to have poisoned me</p>
<p class="p1">with _fried_ beefsteaks and heavy biscuits and green coffee. Couldn’t</p>
<p class="p1">touch a morsel, child! And now I am starved up to a savage pitch! What</p>
<p class="p1">have you got for supper?”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Turtle soup and old crusted port, among other things, father,” replied</p>
<p class="p1">Zuleime, waving her own anxiety for the sake of satisfying him.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“TURTLE SOUP! And OLD CRUSTED PORT;” exclaimed the old man, in an</p>
<p class="p1">ecstacy of delight. “Why, where on earth did they come from?”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“The turtle came from a ship at Norfolk, and was sent hither by Major</p>
<p class="p1">Cabell, who added a dozen of port of his own importation,” said Zuleime,</p>
<p class="p1">dying with anxiety to hear from Frank.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Ah-h-h-h! _That_ was kind! _He’s_ a fellow! He’ll make a magnificent</p>
<p class="p1">husband and son-in-law, Zuleime! I hope you know how turtle soup should</p>
<p class="p1">be made?”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Father, I know it should be eaten quite _hot_, and it is on the table</p>
<p class="p1">by this time. Come in.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">The old man needed no pressing, but went into the dining-room, and sat</p>
<p class="p1">down at the table, with a face radiant with delight. Zuleime waited on</p>
<p class="p1">him, although there was a servant in attendance. And when he had freely</p>
<p class="p1">partaken of turtle soup, devilled crabs, a roasted fowl, etc., washed</p>
<p class="p1">them down with port wine, she brought him a cup of fragrant Mocha coffee</p>
<p class="p1">and his case of cigars. And he sipped the coffee with an air of infinite</p>
<p class="p1">leisure, and then lit a cigar and puffed slowly away, as if eternity was</p>
<p class="p1">before him.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Father, what news from Winchester?” again asked Zuleime, though her</p>
<p class="p1">hopes had fallen very low. “What news, dear father?”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“What’s that to you, my pet? Will you let me digest my supper in peace?”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Zuleime sat down, but looked so anxious, that her very _looks_ worried</p>
<p class="p1">the old gentleman, and he said—</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Don’t you know, girl, that indigestion is very dangerous to a man of my</p>
<p class="p1">time of life? It may bring on apoplexy! Don’t worry me!”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Zuleime veiled her anxious gaze, but even then the paleness of her</p>
<p class="p1">cheeks annoyed her father, and he testily inquired—</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Now, what is it to you? I can understand Carolyn’s anxiety. I cannot</p>
<p class="p1">comprehend yours at all! There, now. Go and send my wife to me!”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Zuleime arose to obey, but before she went, she threw her arms around</p>
<p class="p1">his neck, and asked—</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Dearest father, _only_ tell me! Were our friends well? Have they gone?</p>
<p class="p1">Did they send any message?”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Only answer you three questions at a time! That is reasonable! However,</p>
<p class="p1">I can answer all in one. I have not seen our friends. Their detachment</p>
<p class="p1">left Winchester twelve hours before I reached there. And now I’ll tell</p>
<p class="p1">you what I did not like to tell Carolyn, poor girl! Namely, that the</p>
<p class="p1">detachment marched two days earlier than was intended, upon account of</p>
<p class="p1">dispatches received from Fort ——, praying for speedy succor in a</p>
<p class="p1">reinforcement. The savages have been massacreing and scalping there at a</p>
<p class="p1">most tremendous rate! It is really a very dangerous service, Indian</p>
<p class="p1">warfare! God grant that our young friends may return to us safe! Why</p>
<p class="p1">don’t you go along and tell Georgia to come to me?”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Zuleime kissed her father, settled the cushion under his feet, and went</p>
<p class="p1">on her errand. That dispatched, she sought her own chamber, and lay down</p>
<p class="p1">to collect her thoughts. No letter or message from her husband, and her</p>
<p class="p1">promise of secrecy in regard to her marriage, binding on her as ever.</p>
<p class="p1">And next week she must give an answer to her father for Major Cabell.</p>
<p class="p1">She was confident that one of two things had happened. Either her letter</p>
<p class="p1">had never reached Frank, or else his answer had been lost. And by the</p>
<p class="p1">transaction only one week’s respite had she gained for her father—for</p>
<p class="p1">next week her refusal must be decided and final, and then—what might not</p>
<p class="p1">the consequence be to him? These thoughts excited her mind, and kept her</p>
<p class="p1">awake. And despite her determination to sleep, and her efforts to do so,</p>
<p class="p1">she heard every passing hour strike. It was soon after one o’clock that</p>
<p class="p1">she had fallen into a fitful slumber, when she was awakened by the sound</p>
<p class="p1">of a gay, high voice, intermingling merry words and joyous laughter.</p>
<p class="p1">Indeed, there seemed to be not only one, but many voices, talking and</p>
<p class="p1">laughing in the most jocund manner. And strange—passing strange! it</p>
<p class="p1">seemed to come from her sister’s room, which adjoined hers! She listened</p>
<p class="p1">awhile; the words became fewer, but the laughter grew wilder! And then</p>
<p class="p1">it struck upon her frightened senses that Carolyn was a maniac, talking,</p>
<p class="p1">laughing to herself! Springing from her bed, and without even waiting to</p>
<p class="p1">slip on a gown, she ran into the passage and knocked at her sister’s</p>
<p class="p1">door, and attempted to push it open. It was locked on the inside, and</p>
<p class="p1">all her efforts to force an entrance were vain, and all her entreaties</p>
<p class="p1">for admission were answered by peals of unconscious laughter. At last</p>
<p class="p1">she ran to her father’s door, and rapped loudly, exclaiming—</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Father, father! Get up! get up! Something, I am sure, has happened to</p>
<p class="p1">Carolyn! Something dreadful! Get up! get up!”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">The old man was hard to awaken, even by the efforts of Georgia, who was</p>
<p class="p1">aroused at once, and came and opened the door for Zuleime! And all this</p>
<p class="p1">time the sound of loud talk, high laughter, and wild snatches of song,</p>
<p class="p1">as from several excited people, rather than from one, issued from</p>
<p class="p1">Carolyn’s chamber. At length, by the united exertions of his wife and</p>
<p class="p1">daughter, the fatigued and drowsy old gentleman was aroused and placed</p>
<p class="p1">upon his feet, and made to</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">                  </span>“Understand a horror in their words—</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">                  </span>If not the words.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">He threw on his shawl gown and hastened to Carolyn’s door, which was</p>
<p class="p1">instantly forced open.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">And what a sight met their eyes!</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">There stood Miss Clifton arrayed in her gorgeous bridal costume, looking</p>
<p class="p1">gloriously beautiful, though certainly as no bride ever looked before!</p>
<p class="p1">The raging fever had given the brightness and richness of the carnation</p>
<p class="p1">rose to her complexion, and imparted a supernatural light to her eyes,</p>
<p class="p1">that burned and flashed, and seemed to strike fire as they sprang from</p>
<p class="p1">one to the other of the intruders, with a mad, joyous, defiant glance!</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">The alarm of her father was unlimited, unspeakable! He darted from the</p>
<p class="p1">room, and almost precipitated himself down the stairs in his haste to</p>
<p class="p1">mount and dispatch a servant for the family physician. And while he was</p>
<p class="p1">gone, Georgia and Zuleime, by coaxing and humoring the phantasy of the</p>
<p class="p1">poor girl, succeeded in undressing her and putting her to bed—she still</p>
<p class="p1">raving about her marriage, and sometimes breaking out into a wild laugh,</p>
<p class="p1">and once telling Georgia that _she_, being a married woman, had no right</p>
<p class="p1">or business to be officiating as bridesmaid.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">It was near morning when the doctor came. After examining the state of</p>
<p class="p1">the patient, he pronounced her disease to be brain fever, brought on by</p>
<p class="p1">over-excitement of the nervous system. He wrote prescriptions, and</p>
<p class="p1">remained with her until they were administered. And then he departed</p>
<p class="p1">with a promise to return early in the forenoon.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Mrs. Clifton, of Hardbargain, was summoned, and lost no time in</p>
<p class="p1">hastening to the sick room of her daughter-in-law, as she chose to call</p>
<p class="p1">Carolyn.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">For many days the struggle between life and death went on, and no one,</p>
<p class="p1">not even the medical attendant, was able to form an opinion as to which</p>
<p class="p1">power would eventually conquer.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Mrs. Clifton had taken her station by the bedside of the patient as</p>
<p class="p1">permanent nurse, and she constantly refused to yield her post to any</p>
<p class="p1">other person. And it was to her vigilant attention, quick perceptions,</p>
<p class="p1">and intelligent treatment, that all the family ascribed the recovery of</p>
<p class="p1">the girl. For the crisis came and passed, and Carolyn Clifton lived.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">But no sooner was the patient pronounced out of danger, and the</p>
<p class="p1">excitement of anxiety over, than the nurse herself fell ill. And Mrs.</p>
<p class="p1">Clifton, exhausted, prostrated, entered her carriage, and was driven to</p>
<p class="p1">Hardbargain.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>

<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">As soon as Mrs. Clifton reached home—leaning on the arm of her maid, she</p>
<p class="p1">walked up stairs and entered her son’s deserted room, and when her</p>
<p class="p1">attendant had relieved her of scarf and bonnet, she lay down upon his</p>
<p class="p1">lounge, and sent Henny for Kate Kavanagh. In less than half an hour Kate</p>
<p class="p1">entered. And the lady turned to her and said—</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Catherine, my dear, I must take you into my confidence—yes, and into</p>
<p class="p1">other people’s, too, whether they approve it or not. Draw Archer’s</p>
<p class="p1">writing-desk up here to the side of the lounge. I want you to write a</p>
<p class="p1">letter to him.” Catherine’s brow crimsoned, and she trembled very much</p>
<p class="p1">as she obeyed. “My dear Catherine, I am sure you will be discreet, and</p>
<p class="p1">never speak of what I am about to entrust to you. I can rely on you?”</p>
<p class="p1">said the lady, interrogatively, raising those fever-brightened dark eyes</p>
<p class="p1">to the girl’s face. Catherine nodded quickly, in her usual way, when the</p>
<p class="p1">words would not come. “You see, my dear child, this most unhappy quarrel</p>
<p class="p1">between Carolyn and Archer, is causing a great deal of unnecessary</p>
<p class="p1">suffering to both—and Carolyn, as the frailer of the two, is nearly</p>
<p class="p1">dying under it. Her brain fever was caused by it. And it was as much as</p>
<p class="p1">Dr. Barnes and myself could do, to bring her safely through it with life</p>
<p class="p1">and reason. This estrangement between them must not continue, or she</p>
<p class="p1">_will_ die. She is not so strong as she looks to be. Indeed, she is very</p>
<p class="p1">delicate, like her mother. Archer is far on his Western march now, and</p>
<p class="p1">cannot return of course; but he must write to her, and comfort her. I</p>
<p class="p1">wish you to write and tell him so. Now, then, child, you know the</p>
<p class="p1">object. Open the desk, and lay out the paper, while I try to think what</p>
<p class="p1">I want said, and how I want you to say it.” Catherine’s hands quivered</p>
<p class="p1">as she turned down the leaf of the desk, and mechanically laid the paper</p>
<p class="p1">out on the top. “Just date it, dear child, and then I will tell you how</p>
<p class="p1">to begin.” Catherine dipped her pen in ink, and was just about to put it</p>
<p class="p1">to paper, when something there caught and held her eyes, and she gazed</p>
<p class="p1">with dilating pupils, and trembled more than ever.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">The paper before her was covered with a water-colored sketch of</p>
<p class="p1">Marguerite, of France, at the siege of Damietta. And the ideal face of</p>
<p class="p1">the royal heroine, was the real one of the humble Catherine herself. And</p>
<p class="p1">in the corner of the paper were the initials A. C. He had taken _her_</p>
<p class="p1">homely features as his notion of those of the heroic Queen of St. Louis.</p>
<p class="p1">And as she gazed, her heart shuddered with a strange, wild emotion of</p>
<p class="p1">blended wonder, joy and remorse. The nature of the maiden was becoming</p>
<p class="p1">vaguely intelligible to herself.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">And Mrs. Clifton did not see her trance, but lay upon the sofa very</p>
<p class="p1">weary, with her hands pressed upon her temples, trying to settle in what</p>
<p class="p1">manner she should address her son upon this delicate subject. And</p>
<p class="p1">Catherine forgot everything in the sketch before her, and the</p>
<p class="p1">tumultuous, blissful, painful emotions it excited. An abyss was suddenly</p>
<p class="p1">thrown open in the depths of her heart, whose existence was unsuspected</p>
<p class="p1">till now. _Now_ was she sorry that the marriage between Archer Clifton</p>
<p class="p1">and his cousin, was broken off—by mutual consent? She tried very</p>
<p class="p1">earnestly to feel sorry, for she believed it her duty to be so. She</p>
<p class="p1">forced herself to remember Carolyn’s illness, and Archer’s own</p>
<p class="p1">suffering, in consequence of the estrangement between them. But, oh!</p>
<p class="p1">there lay that picture before her eyes, with her own plain face</p>
<p class="p1">idealized, glorified up to a high, pure, divine beauty, such as it had</p>
<p class="p1">never, even in her highest, holiest, most inspired moods, possessed. And</p>
<p class="p1">a voice from her profound heart whispered—“Oh, yes, and he could make me</p>
<p class="p1">really beautiful and glorious as his ideal there—for he could make me</p>
<p class="p1">good, and glad, and great beyond whatever I could make myself—if he</p>
<p class="p1">chose!” She reproached her heart severely for its seductive whisper. She</p>
<p class="p1">offered up a silent prayer to God to forgive her, and save her soul from</p>
<p class="p1">secret sin. She called herself foolish, presumptuous, treacherous. But,</p>
<p class="p1">oh! in spite of all these, would sparkle up from the depths of her</p>
<p class="p1">spirit, sprays of gladness, as if there had suddenly sprung within an</p>
<p class="p1">everlasting fountain of joy. Yet again she blamed herself most bitterly.</p>
<p class="p1">She repeated that despairing complaint or confession of David—“The heart</p>
<p class="p1">is deceitful above all things, and desperately wicked.” She almost</p>
<p class="p1">realized its truth. She silently cried to God to enter her heart, and</p>
<p class="p1">expel its secret sin.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Well, child! are you ready!” inquired Mrs. Clifton, withdrawing her</p>
<p class="p1">hands from her temples, and looking towards the entranced girl. Kate did</p>
<p class="p1">not hear or see, her soul and senses were absorbed in the subject before</p>
<p class="p1">her. Yet she did not think or hope about the future. It was the present,</p>
<p class="p1">the present that absorbed her heart, despite of will, resistance and</p>
<p class="p1">conscience.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Kate! are you asleep or in a trance?” asked the lady, gazing at her.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">The maiden started, and blushed deeply.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Catherine! what are you thinking of?” she repeated, fixing her dark</p>
<p class="p1">eyes upon the girl, until they seemed to burn into her soul.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Kate looked guilty and bewildered, recovering herself by an effort, and</p>
<p class="p1">answered, almost at random—</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“This is not letter paper, madam, it is Bristol board.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Oh, well! there is writing paper in the other department of the desk,</p>
<p class="p1">my child, get it out.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Kate examined the contents of the desk, and then replied—</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“There is no letter paper here, whatever, Mrs. Clifton.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“What are those?”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Only card boards and sketches, madam.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Sketches. That is just like Archer, to keep his sketches in his writing</p>
<p class="p1">desk. His writing material will no doubt be found in his portfolio. But</p>
<p class="p1">let me see those sketches, Catherine; I have not seen them yet, and they</p>
<p class="p1">will be something new to me—almost like a recent letter from Archer. I</p>
<p class="p1">like to look over his drawings; they always mean something apart from</p>
<p class="p1">their subject, as it seems to me. I often think his sketches form a</p>
<p class="p1">running commentary, though an involuntary one, on his life and thoughts!</p>
<p class="p1">Hand them to me, my child.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“These are only old historical subjects,” said Kate, with visible</p>
<p class="p1">reluctance to produce them.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Pass them over to me, my dear. If their subjects are as old as the</p>
<p class="p1">Chinese History of the Creation, they will nevertheless be eloquent to</p>
<p class="p1">me of my son’s present mood—of the state of his heart, and the progress</p>
<p class="p1">or the retrogression of his mind. You cannot imagine, Catherine, the</p>
<p class="p1">anxious curiosity of a mother to catch furtive glimpses of the interior</p>
<p class="p1">of that heart she cannot always enter, and which is often hidden, too,</p>
<p class="p1">from its possessor! ‘We know not what manner of spirit we are of,’</p>
<p class="p1">Catherine. For instance, do you know your own heart or mind? In all</p>
<p class="p1">hearts lie depths below depths, never known to the owner until some</p>
<p class="p1">earthquake of sorrow, or of passion, throw them open to view! There are</p>
<p class="p1">in all minds powers beyond powers of achievement or of endurance,</p>
<p class="p1">unsuspected by their possessor until some emergency calls them into</p>
<p class="p1">action! But give me the drawings, Kate, they will refresh me like a talk</p>
<p class="p1">with Archer.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Catherine lifted them, _en masse_, and handed them to Mrs. Clifton, who</p>
<p class="p1">took and examined each separately and leisurely.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Um-m-me,” she said, smiling gently, as she recognized their</p>
<p class="p1">subjects:—“‘Marguerite of France, at the Siege of Damietta,’ ‘Joan of</p>
<p class="p1">Arc, at Rheims,’ ‘Margaret of Anjou, at St. Albans,’ ‘Last interview of</p>
<p class="p1">Lord and Lady Russel,’ and all these battle-axe heroines, wearing the</p>
<p class="p1">likeness of my serious, domestic Catherine! In truth, Archer has put you</p>
<p class="p1">through as many characters and costumes as though he designed you for a</p>
<p class="p1">tragic actress, in the heaviest line.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Kate Kavanagh did not like that.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“But two of these characters bear any affinity to you, my dear. I cannot</p>
<p class="p1">fancy any similitude between the tender and fiery Marguerite—that</p>
<p class="p1">‘falcon-hearted dove,’ or her haughty and remorseless namesake of Anjou,</p>
<p class="p1">and my grave, gentle Catherine. But the high and holy enthusiasm</p>
<p class="p1">irradiating Joan’s face, and the noble resignation of Lady Russel’s</p>
<p class="p1">countenance, suit your striking features very well. But I am talking</p>
<p class="p1">like a mediocre stage critic. Captain Clifton has a very high opinion,</p>
<p class="p1">of you, my Catherine. Pray try to merit it, my dear girl!” concluded the</p>
<p class="p1">lady, with a little pardonable motherly pride.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Kate Kavanagh looked down, and fingered the pens and wafers, for she</p>
<p class="p1">felt the lady’s eyes gazing through and through her—reading her very</p>
<p class="p1">soul.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“By the way, Catherine, have you seen Captain Clifton’s last work of</p>
<p class="p1">art?”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“No, madam.” (I wonder why she calls him “Captain Clifton” to _me_—she</p>
<p class="p1">never did so before, thought Kate.)</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“It is a highly finished miniature of Miss Clifton, painted on ivory. He</p>
<p class="p1">had it set in a plain gold locket, and has taken it away with him. I saw</p>
<p class="p1">him hang it around his neck, and lay it near his heart.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Catherine honestly believed that she was glad to hear this, for it</p>
<p class="p1">seemed one more stay to keep her thoughts right.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“And that, Catherine, is one reason among many others I have, for</p>
<p class="p1">knowing his indestructible love for Carolyn. And that is why I feel no</p>
<p class="p1">hesitation in having this letter written, to end this foolish quarrel,</p>
<p class="p1">and to restore peace to these two unhappy young people,” said Mrs.</p>
<p class="p1">Clifton, looking, Catherine thought, very strangely at her—_so_</p>
<p class="p1">strangely, that the maiden felt her cheeks burn with a vague sense of</p>
<p class="p1">humiliation.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">She asked herself—Could Mrs. Clifton have read what had been passing in</p>
<p class="p1">her mind? Well! if so—that was another band to bind her thoughts to the</p>
<p class="p1">right.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Now, then, to your task, my child. You will find paper in Captain</p>
<p class="p1">Clifton’s portfolio.” She spoke gently as ever to Kate, but still called</p>
<p class="p1">her son “Captain Clifton,” as if to widen the distance between them.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Kate felt troubled at this, and then took herself to task for a state of</p>
<p class="p1">mind so morbidly acute to impressions, that she noticed everything, even</p>
<p class="p1">that trifle. She searched and found the writing materials in the</p>
<p class="p1">portfolio, and went to work and wrote, from Mrs. Clifton’s dictation, a</p>
<p class="p1">letter, full of gentle rebuke, and kind, motherly counsel, to Archer</p>
<p class="p1">Clifton. And all to the end that he should write immediately, and</p>
<p class="p1">reconcile himself to Carolyn, who was extremely ill, and whom his mother</p>
<p class="p1">felt assured, she said, that he must be most anxious to propitiate. The</p>
<p class="p1">letter was sealed and dispatched, and the lady, thoroughly worn out, and</p>
<p class="p1">leaning upon the arm of Catherine, sought her own bed-chamber.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">The next morning, Mrs. Clifton was so weary that she could only leave</p>
<p class="p1">her bed-chamber to lie upon the sofa in the shady parlor, where she</p>
<p class="p1">could be at hand to direct the operations of her house servants—now</p>
<p class="p1">engaged in cutting out and making up the Fall clothing for the negroes.</p>
<p class="p1">Catherine came early to assist in this onerous task. It was in the</p>
<p class="p1">afternoon while the lady was still reclining on the sofa, and Catherine</p>
<p class="p1">standing at a work-table basting a linsey-woolsey frock-body—when a</p>
<p class="p1">horse was heard to gallop up into the yard, a man to jump off and hasten</p>
<p class="p1">up the steps of the piazza, and the instant after, old Mr. Clifton</p>
<p class="p1">entered the parlor, looking very much flurried and alarmed.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“What is the matter? I hope Carolyn is no worse?” asked the lady,</p>
<p class="p1">anxious, yet calm.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“No! Yes! A great deal better of course since the turn last night! Most</p>
<p class="p1">malignant form of the disease, and growing rapidly worse every hour. _I</p>
<p class="p1">tell you it is!_ The doctor affirms it!”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Mrs. Clifton gazed at him in a sort of self-possessed perplexity.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“She has got the small-pox, madam.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“The small-pox!”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Yes, madam, the confluent small-pox, in its worst form.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“You astonish me! I trust—I believe you are mistaken!”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“No—I wish to Heaven I was! No, madam! Doctor’s opinion!”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Why, how on earth. Sit down, Mr. Clifton! Kate, my dear, wheel that</p>
<p class="p1">arm-chair around.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Catherine obeyed, and the old gentleman sank among its soft cushions,</p>
<p class="p1">and took out his pocket-handkerchief and wiped his face.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“How on earth could she have got it?” asked Mrs. Clifton.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Ah! Lord Almighty knows! Came spontaneously, I do suppose! You noticed</p>
<p class="p1">those two pimples that appeared upon her forehead after the crisis of</p>
<p class="p1">her fever passed?”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Yes; but I thought nothing of them.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Nor did we at the time. But at any rate, that was the first appearance</p>
<p class="p1">of the eruption—little as we guessed it at the time. You see, she</p>
<p class="p1">naturally began to grow better when this other disease began to break</p>
<p class="p1">out, I suppose. Indeed, I have no doubt it was the coming of the</p>
<p class="p1">small-pox, that arrested the fatal termination of the brain fever. Well,</p>
<p class="p1">you see, last night after you had left her so much better, we entrusted</p>
<p class="p1">her to the care of Zuleime, who did not seem to be so much worn out with</p>
<p class="p1">watching as the rest of us. So Zuleime sat up with her; and she tells me</p>
<p class="p1">that before midnight her face was sprinkled all over with those pimples.</p>
<p class="p1">And this morning, when I first saw her—” The old man’s voice broke down</p>
<p class="p1">for a moment. “Oh! it was dreadful! Her beautiful, fair face, neck,</p>
<p class="p1">bosom, arms, all covered over with that horrible eruption! It had all</p>
<p class="p1">run together in one mass. We sent off to hasten the arrival of the</p>
<p class="p1">doctor, who, when he came, pronounced the disease to be confluent</p>
<p class="p1">small-pox. Oh, it is horrible! horrible, even, if her life be spared!</p>
<p class="p1">Disfigured for life! What a fate for a woman! I drove Zuleime out of the</p>
<p class="p1">room against her will—for she, dear, generous girl, wished to stay and</p>
<p class="p1">tend her sister. Georgia told me at breakfast, that she had just got a</p>
<p class="p1">letter from her father, who was ill—and that she must have the carriage</p>
<p class="p1">to go to Richmond. She did not show me the letter, for she made haste</p>
<p class="p1">and started almost immediately. Everything falls out disastrously at</p>
<p class="p1">once. Now, what am I to do? I cannot procure a nurse to that disease,</p>
<p class="p1">for love or money, in this neighborhood. Advise me what to do. The</p>
<p class="p1">necessity is so urgent!”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Mrs. Clifton was now sitting up, supporting her head upon her hand, and</p>
<p class="p1">essaying her strength.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“I must go back, and nurse Carolyn myself.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“You! Now, never suppose, my dear sister, that I have been hinting for</p>
<p class="p1">you to return and finish killing yourself for us! I would not permit it,</p>
<p class="p1">if you wished it ever so much! I’ll lock and bar the doors and windows,</p>
<p class="p1">to keep you out, first. But think and counsel me as to the best thing to</p>
<p class="p1">be done. There is no one at home but Zuleime—and even if I were willing</p>
<p class="p1">she should risk taking the dreadful disease, she is so very young and</p>
<p class="p1">inexperienced that I should be afraid to trust her sister’s safety in</p>
<p class="p1">her hands. But I am not willing that she should run any risk to</p>
<p class="p1">_herself_—that’s flat. But what’s to be done?”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“There is not a servant on your plantation, or on this farm, fit to be</p>
<p class="p1">trusted in such a case. I must go and take care of my daughter myself!”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“D—d if you shall, ma’am! I’ll bar my doors and windows against you,</p>
<p class="p1">first, I tell you! Why, in your weak state, it would be suicide!”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">The lady maintained her purpose against Mr. Clifton’s vehement</p>
<p class="p1">opposition, and her calm persistence must have conquered, but Kate</p>
<p class="p1">Kavanagh mildly interposed, by saying—</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Let me go.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“You!” exclaimed Mr. and Mrs. Clifton, in a breath.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Yes; I am not a bad nurse. I have had considerable experience with sick</p>
<p class="p1">people.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“But—you’ve never had the small-pox—you’re not the least marked!” said</p>
<p class="p1">Mr. Clifton.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“No, sir, I have never had that disease!”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“And you are willing to risk taking it?”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Yes, sir!”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“What! and you a young girl! Ain’t you afraid of catching it, and having</p>
<p class="p1">your face spoiled?”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Yes, sir, I am afraid of contracting it.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Why that is a plain contradiction of yourself; you say you are willing</p>
<p class="p1">to risk it, and afraid of catching it. I do not understand you at all.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Catherine is so simply truthful and straight-forward!” said the lady,</p>
<p class="p1">smiling; “she means that she is perfectly conscious of the extent of the</p>
<p class="p1">danger of contagion, but that she thinks it her duty to brave it,</p>
<p class="p1">nevertheless! Is not that it, my dear? But, Catherine, much as we thank</p>
<p class="p1">you for your generous self-devotion, we must not permit you to think of</p>
<p class="p1">going. I must do that, for I have had the disease. If you were to</p>
<p class="p1">persist in your purpose, my dear girl, you would almost certainly get</p>
<p class="p1">the small-pox, and then your life, or at the very least, your beauty,</p>
<p class="p1">would be sacrificed.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Beauty!—If I had it and were to lose it, dear lady, there is no one to</p>
<p class="p1">care for it!”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Yes, _I_ should care for it, my Kate,” said the lady, putting her arm</p>
<p class="p1">around the girl’s waist, and drawing her closer.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“In fine, my good girl, you shall not go if you are afraid! That’s</p>
<p class="p1">certain!” said Mr. Clifton.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Oh, sir, that would not interfere with the faithful discharge of my</p>
<p class="p1">duties as nurse. You had best let me go, and go at once, sir! There is</p>
<p class="p1">no time to be lost, surely. Is any competent person with Miss Clifton</p>
<p class="p1">now, sir?”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“No one but a colored woman, and I really _must_ hurry back. And, so if</p>
<p class="p1">you really _do_ feel disposed to go, my dear girl,—is she a good nurse,</p>
<p class="p1">Mrs. Clifton?”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Excellent, sir! But indeed I do not like her exposing herself in my</p>
<p class="p1">stead. I should not permit her to do it, indeed, if my power seconded my</p>
<p class="p1">will,” added the lady, sinking back fatigued upon her sofa cushions.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Old Mr. Clifton was evidently inclined to accept Kate’s services. Mrs.</p>
<p class="p1">Clifton was obliged to yield,—more to the weakness that overpowered her</p>
<p class="p1">frame than to the arguments set forth by Catherine. It was settled,</p>
<p class="p1">then, that Kate should go. And she quickly put on her little straw</p>
<p class="p1">bonnet and black silk scarf, and entered the gig that the old gentleman</p>
<p class="p1">borrowed from the lady to convey the girl to Clifton.</p>

<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">The mansion-house at White Cliffs was all but deserted. The very house</p>
<p class="p1">servants, pretty mulatto girls, more afraid of destroying their good</p>
<p class="p1">looks than losing their lives, had retreated to their own dens, feigning</p>
<p class="p1">illness as an excuse to keep out of the reach of contagion. Catherine</p>
<p class="p1">was introduced at once into the sick room. That sick room! What mind can</p>
<p class="p1">conceive, or what pen _should_ describe it. Only those who have nursed a</p>
<p class="p1">patient through that worst form of the most loathsome pestilence, can</p>
<p class="p1">realize its revolting horrors. To see any human being looking as the</p>
<p class="p1">once beautiful Carolyn now looked. Her very features almost obliterated,</p>
<p class="p1">while——fill up the pause, you who have seen the horrors of that pest. It</p>
<p class="p1">was worse than any form of illness—it was worse than death and decay.</p>
<p class="p1">Disgust almost overmastered pity, and Catherine turned away, shuddering</p>
<p class="p1">with sickness of body and soul. Old Mr. Clifton cast one agonized look</p>
<p class="p1">upon the ruin, and unable to bear the sight, rushed from the room.</p>
<p class="p1">Catherine turned to her duty. The wretched patient was tossing about in</p>
<p class="p1">high fever, and tearing her arms and bosom under the intolerable</p>
<p class="p1">irritation. That work of destruction must be stopped first Catherine</p>
<p class="p1">knew. Catherine caught her right hand, and it took all her strength to</p>
<p class="p1">hold that hand, whose flesh seemed as if it would drop off, under the</p>
<p class="p1">pressure, while she secured it to the bedstead. Then she captured the</p>
<p class="p1">other dashing, tossing hand, and confined it in the same manner. And</p>
<p class="p1">then she looked at the state of her own palms. Oh, offensive duty! No</p>
<p class="p1">wonder, she thought, that the beautiful Georgia had fled to Richmond,</p>
<p class="p1">and the two pretty house-maids were extremely ill in their attic! Had</p>
<p class="p1">_she_ a wish to follow their example? No—for now all selfish fears were</p>
<p class="p1">lost in deep compassion for the poor, forsaken wreck of beauty, that lay</p>
<p class="p1">there at her mercy. She returned to her duty. She administered to her</p>
<p class="p1">patient an opiate, to soothe her restlessness. Took a sponge and tepid</p>
<p class="p1">water, and thoroughly cleansed the surface of the skin, and anointed</p>
<p class="p1">face, bosom and arms with a fragrant emollient, to allay the intolerable</p>
<p class="p1">itching. She then released her hands, and laid them easily upon the</p>
<p class="p1">counterpane. Lastly, she ventilated and darkened the chamber, and took</p>
<p class="p1">her seat by the bedside, to fan her patient while she slept. And deep</p>
<p class="p1">was her satisfaction in watching that quiet, refreshing sleep. It is not</p>
<p class="p1">my intention to lead my reader through the dismal days that followed in</p>
<p class="p1">that sick room, until the “secondary fever,” the crisis of the disease,</p>
<p class="p1">came and passed. Catherine nursed her patient tenderly, faithfully,</p>
<p class="p1">night and day. Carolyn’s life was spared, but her peerless beauty was</p>
<p class="p1">gone forever. Her luxuriant, fair hair was all lost, and her head was as</p>
<p class="p1">bald and discolored as her face—and that!</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">In that darkened chamber, and in the midst of physical suffering and</p>
<p class="p1">weakness, Carolyn had had no opportunity of ascertaining the extent of</p>
<p class="p1">the ravages the disease had made in her beauty—if indeed she knew the</p>
<p class="p1">nature of the former, or thought about the latter. But as she</p>
<p class="p1">convalesced, and became able to sit up in bed and converse, she felt an</p>
<p class="p1">invalid’s childish curiosity to look in the glass, and frequently</p>
<p class="p1">requested her gentle nurse to hand her one. But Catherine, dreading the</p>
<p class="p1">effect of the shock, steadily refused to comply with her wishes in that</p>
<p class="p1">respect, and perseveringly kept the room darkened. And the sick girl,</p>
<p class="p1">too weak to persist long in any controversy, yielded the point.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">But one day, while Catherine was at her breakfast, and old Darkey</p>
<p class="p1">supplying her place by the bedside of the patient, Carolyn said in a</p>
<p class="p1">tone that admitted of no denial, or even delay—</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Darkey, hand me that hand-glass from my dressing-table.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">And the old woman impulsively, thoughtlessly obeyed her, and brought it.</p>
<p class="p1">Carolyn was propped up in bed. She took the mirror, gave one interested</p>
<p class="p1">look into it—plucked off her little cap—gave another hurried glance—and</p>
<p class="p1">uttering a long, low cry of despair, sunk back insensible upon her</p>
<p class="p1">pillow.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Old Darkey flew from the chair to the patient, and from the patient to</p>
<p class="p1">the bell, in great trepidation—ringing peals that brought all the</p>
<p class="p1">household hurrying in alarm to the room. Old Mr. Clifton, being nearest</p>
<p class="p1">at hand, arrived first. And when he saw and understood what had</p>
<p class="p1">happened, he seized the hand-glass, and threw it out of the window, and</p>
<p class="p1">laid hold of the heavy toilet mirror, and sent it flying after. Then he</p>
<p class="p1">drove old Darkey from the room, forbidding her, for a stupid and</p>
<p class="p1">dangerous maniac, ever to show her face there again. And all this time,</p>
<p class="p1">Catherine, who had entered so quietly that no one saw or heard her, was</p>
<p class="p1">silently trying to restore the swooning girl. As Carolyn, with a deep</p>
<p class="p1">sigh, opened her eyes, Kate motioned for every one to leave the chamber.</p>
<p class="p1">And all noiselessly withdrew. Carolyn shivered and shuddered several</p>
<p class="p1">times, as she raised her eyes appealingly, despairingly to Catherine,</p>
<p class="p1">who was bending tenderly over her. Catherine thought it best to answer</p>
<p class="p1">that silent appeal by speaking at once to the point.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“My dear Miss Clifton, you must not think that your face will continue</p>
<p class="p1">to look anything like it does now, for it will not, indeed. For though</p>
<p class="p1">it is very much discolored, it is not much pitted, and the discoloration</p>
<p class="p1">will wear off in a few days. And as for your hair, Miss Clifton, that</p>
<p class="p1">will grow out very soon, and be even more beautiful and luxuriant than</p>
<p class="p1">before, on account of the renewal of the skin—so, dear lady, take</p>
<p class="p1">comfort and do not look in the glass again until you are better.” And</p>
<p class="p1">all this time that Catherine spoke in this gentle manner, she was</p>
<p class="p1">bathing the girl’s face and hands with bay water, and her tender touch</p>
<p class="p1">was even more soothing than the sedative liquid. Catherine was almost</p>
<p class="p1">impelled to say—“Have patience—bow to the will of God, and try to learn</p>
<p class="p1">the lesson He intends to teach in this.” But she felt the hour had not</p>
<p class="p1">come for speaking such words. That she herself must have patience and</p>
<p class="p1">wait for the time when she might minister to her spiritual need.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Up to this period, Miss Clifton did not know who her nurse was. She had</p>
<p class="p1">heard her called “My dear child,” or “My good girl,” by the physician</p>
<p class="p1">and by her father, and they were the only visitors to the room, except</p>
<p class="p1">old Darkey, who came to relieve the nurse at meal times, and who simply</p>
<p class="p1">called her “Miss.” And if once or twice she had heard her called</p>
<p class="p1">Catherine—still she never imagined her to be Kate Kavanagh, but some</p>
<p class="p1">hired attendant. And, indeed, in the languor of illness she thought</p>
<p class="p1">nothing about it. A few days after this, however, when she had grown</p>
<p class="p1">more composed and resigned, and while she lay watching Catherine’s quiet</p>
<p class="p1">movements through the room, she said—</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“My dear, good girl—my gentle nurse—tell me your name? I _do_ pray</p>
<p class="p1">sometimes, and I wish to know your name that I may ask God to bless you</p>
<p class="p1">for exposing life and health and beauty for one whom mother, and sister,</p>
<p class="p1">and servants all deserted.” Just now, for the first time, it flashed</p>
<p class="p1">like lightning through Kate’s mind that all the danger of infection was</p>
<p class="p1">over, and that she might now thank God for preserving her from</p>
<p class="p1">contagion. Yes! she had forgotten herself for some time past, but now</p>
<p class="p1">her heart leaped for joy and gratitude, and she thanked God before she</p>
<p class="p1">replied to Miss Clifton’s question, and said—</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“My name is Catherine Kavanagh.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“So!—you are Kate Kavanagh! Hoist up the blind. Come to me. Let me look</p>
<p class="p1">at you,” said Miss Clifton, raising on her elbow. Smiling, because</p>
<p class="p1">unconscious of the hidden meaning in her words, Catherine approached and</p>
<p class="p1">sat down by her bed. And Carolyn took both her hands, and</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">                </span>“Fell to the perusing of her face,</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">                </span>As though she’d learn it off by heart.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">She pored over the broad, square forehead, looking strong, but not</p>
<p class="p1">beautiful, for all the bright chestnut hair was pushed carelessly</p>
<p class="p1">aside—she gazed upon those dark gray eyes under their long black</p>
<p class="p1">fringes—such deep, transparent wells of darkness and light they were—she</p>
<p class="p1">dwelt upon the beautiful lips, and then her glance roved over the</p>
<p class="p1">symmetrical form. And she thought she had never seen so perfect a</p>
<p class="p1">figure. And she sighed and raised her eyes again to the remarkable</p>
<p class="p1">countenance, with its large features, pale and cadaverous now with a</p>
<p class="p1">long season of confinement, fatigue and loss of sleep, and grave with</p>
<p class="p1">thought, and earnest with deep feeling. And she could not settle it to</p>
<p class="p1">her satisfaction whether Kate Kavanagh was a sublime beauty or a fright.</p>
<p class="p1">Upon the whole, the girl interested and pained her. And she continued to</p>
<p class="p1">hold her hands with a nervous grasp, and pore over her face and form as</p>
<p class="p1">freely as though she had been only a dreadfully fascinating statue—while</p>
<p class="p1">Kate blushed under the infliction, and finally drew her hands away and</p>
<p class="p1">sat down.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">But every day Miss Clifton’s confidence in, and esteem for Kate</p>
<p class="p1">Kavanagh, increased. And every day Catherine sought to draw her</p>
<p class="p1">patient’s soul to the only true source of light, strength and</p>
<p class="p1">consolation; and to sanctify this terrible affliction to her spirit’s</p>
<p class="p1">good. The obligation to do this pressed upon the girl’s conscience</p>
<p class="p1">heavily, as if it were the hand of God. It was in vain that she said to</p>
<p class="p1">herself, “I am nothing but a weak, erring girl. It would be presumption</p>
<p class="p1">in me to speak. It might be received as impertinence, and do more harm</p>
<p class="p1">than good.” Still the answer arose from the depths of her heart,</p>
<p class="p1">saying—“Speak the fitting words at the fitting time, as they arise</p>
<p class="p1">within your mind, for they are the inspiration of God’s spirit.” And</p>
<p class="p1">wisely, lovingly, reverently she spoke them as occasion called them</p>
<p class="p1">forth. The right thing was always said at the moment it was needed.</p>
<p class="p1">“Words spoken in season are like apples of gold on plates of silver.”</p>
<p class="p1">Many a willing but bungling Christian would have failed to do Carolyn</p>
<p class="p1">any good, for Miss Clifton was a very difficult subject. There is</p>
<p class="p1">nothing so hard of impression as pride and scorn and jealousy. It was</p>
<p class="p1">the dominion of that infernal triumvirate that made Lucifer an</p>
<p class="p1">impracticable subject among the angels. But Catherine was moved and</p>
<p class="p1">guided by a higher power than herself. Of herself she dared say nothing</p>
<p class="p1">on Divine subjects. She only spoke when strongly, irresistibly impelled</p>
<p class="p1">to do so. And her words were blessed to her patient and sanctified to</p>
<p class="p1">her own spirit.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Catherine had a powerful coadjutor in her good work. It was the sorrow</p>
<p class="p1">in Carolyn’s heart. And ah, who could sound the depth of that sorrow?</p>
<p class="p1">Loving as passionately as she had loved! Sinning against that love as</p>
<p class="p1">cruelly as she had sinned! Punished for her sin as terribly as she was</p>
<p class="p1">punished! And now ruined and hideous in person, and wrecked and</p>
<p class="p1">despairing in mind, to whom could she cry in her sharp agony but to</p>
<p class="p1">God?—her Creator and Father!—Whose arm was strong enough to lift her</p>
<p class="p1">from that horrible pit but God’s—but God’s? And the All-Powerful, the</p>
<p class="p1">All-Merciful, was helping her every day.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">The great strength, the great vitality of her sorrow, was the thought of</p>
<p class="p1">Archer Clifton. Could she have hoped for a reconciliation with him,</p>
<p class="p1">however distant, all else might have been borne. But with that death’s</p>
<p class="p1">head of hers, such joy might never be hoped—ought never to be wished.</p>
<p class="p1">No, she was as the leper, set apart from human love—at least from</p>
<p class="p1">conjugal and maternal love—forever and forever! This was hard—this was</p>
<p class="p1">well nigh intolerable!</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">She would no more grace the saloon with her surpassing loveliness—the</p>
<p class="p1">pride of her family—the ornament of their house. Her heart would no more</p>
<p class="p1">swell with exultation, when, on entering the drawing-room, in the full</p>
<p class="p1">glory of her peerless beauty, she would hear a murmur of admiration pass</p>
<p class="p1">through the company. No. If she should ever enter a saloon again, she</p>
<p class="p1">would make a tremendous sensation, truly—but it would be one of</p>
<p class="p1">astonishment, pity, and perhaps disgust. And that thought was dreadful,</p>
<p class="p1">dreadful to the proud young belle! But oh! it was as nothing to the</p>
<p class="p1">feeling that her household gods were broken and ruined forever—that her</p>
<p class="p1">hopes of domestic happiness were gone forever! For underneath all the</p>
<p class="p1">pride and vanity and scorn of the young belle had been the woman’s</p>
<p class="p1">thought, the woman’s hope of the coming long, calm days of wife and</p>
<p class="p1">mother joy. Yea, as surely as under the burnished satin boddice had beat</p>
<p class="p1">the heart of flesh! But all these were over now; the proud, vain</p>
<p class="p1">aspirations of the belle, and the woman’s deeper, purer hopes! Both</p>
<p class="p1">crushed by one fell blow! All was lost in the world! Nothing was left</p>
<p class="p1">but Heaven!</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">                                </span>“If God would take</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">                    </span>A heart that earth had crushed.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Many are driven by the storms of life to the Heavenly Father’s bosom. It</p>
<p class="p1">is for this that the tempests of sorrow are sent, and the sooner that</p>
<p class="p1">Divine sanctuary is sought, the better, for hard and harder will beat</p>
<p class="p1">the storm until its end is answered. And too often all is lost, or seems</p>
<p class="p1">lost, before we consent to save ourselves. With Carolyn, all the</p>
<p class="p1">treasures of her youth were gone,—health and beauty, love and hope.</p>
<p class="p1">Something like this she breathed to Catherine, in a weak, despairing</p>
<p class="p1">mood,—for only in a miserably depressed state of mind and body would the</p>
<p class="p1">proud girl deign to complain.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Dear lady, do not say so sadly that ‘all is lost—forever lost.’ Dear</p>
<p class="p1">lady, _nothing is ever lost_. It is impossible. The Lord, in His Divine</p>
<p class="p1">Wisdom, may withdraw His gifts, but they are not lost—they have gone</p>
<p class="p1">into His keeping.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“I do not comprehend you! My poor good looks, such as they were, are</p>
<p class="p1">surely gone forever. Nothing can restore them! And oh, Catherine! you do</p>
<p class="p1">not know—you cannot understand all the blessings, the hope, and the joy</p>
<p class="p1">of my life fled forever! You are a child—you do not understand it!”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Perhaps I do not, lady, and perhaps I _do_! Seek all that you have lost</p>
<p class="p1">in God! He has withdrawn His gifts, your treasures, that He may draw you</p>
<p class="p1">to Himself! They are safe in His treasure house. If you have lost the</p>
<p class="p1">beauty of the fair roseate complexion, He can endow you with a higher</p>
<p class="p1">beauty, emanating from the soul. If you have lost human love, He can</p>
<p class="p1">satisfy your soul with the richness and fullness of Divine love that</p>
<p class="p1">never faileth! And for your broken earthly hopes, He can give you the</p>
<p class="p1">Heavenly hope that never dieth.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Oh! but it is the lost earthly hope, personal beauty and human love,</p>
<p class="p1">that were so dear to me! So dear to me!” exclaimed the poor girl,</p>
<p class="p1">bursting into a passion of tears.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“And He can restore even those! ‘But seek ye _first_ the Kingdom of</p>
<p class="p1">Heaven, and all these things shall be added to you.’”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Ah, child! _Nothing_ but a miracle could give me back dead happiness.</p>
<p class="p1">And the days of miracles are over!”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“No! no! There is nothing in the Scripture to warrant that saying. The</p>
<p class="p1">days of miracles are _not_ passed. Until the days of human faith and</p>
<p class="p1">Divine Omnipotence are past—the days of miracles are not passed.</p>
<p class="p1">Anything that _seems_ to me right that I should have, I will pray</p>
<p class="p1">God—that if it _be_ right, He will give it me—though it should appear to</p>
<p class="p1">my ignorance utterly impossible!” Then Catherine abruptly stopped,</p>
<p class="p1">fearing that she had said too much. And she silently prayed for a faith</p>
<p class="p1">that should be as far removed from presumption, as from despair.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Carolyn convalesced very slowly. It was weeks before she left her bed.</p>
<p class="p1">And then many more weeks before she left her room.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">It was a glorious day in Autumn, when she first walked out upon the</p>
<p class="p1">lawn, supported between Catherine and her father. And as soon as she set</p>
<p class="p1">foot upon the green sward, some cattle that were browsing there—by some</p>
<p class="p1">caprice to which cattle are subject—started off as if seized by sudden</p>
<p class="p1">panic, and ran huddling together confusedly, and precipitating</p>
<p class="p1">themselves towards the outer gate. And so weak were the poor invalid’s</p>
<p class="p1">nerves, and so morbid her mind, that she burst into tears, and declared</p>
<p class="p1">that the very brutes fled from before her face, as from one less human</p>
<p class="p1">than themselves! Nor could any argument of Mr. Clifton’s or of</p>
<p class="p1">Catherine’s, disabuse her mind of this absurd idea. She begged Catherine</p>
<p class="p1">to take her back to her chamber. And for many weeks no entreaties could</p>
<p class="p1">induce her to leave it.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Zuleime came freely to her sister now. She had her harp brought into her</p>
<p class="p1">room. And she soothed the recluse with music every day. And at last Kate</p>
<p class="p1">Kavanagh, who had gradually merged from nurse into companion, added her</p>
<p class="p1">own rich, full-toned voice in accompaniment. The Misses Clifton were</p>
<p class="p1">both very much surprised to see this “gift of gracious nature” thrown</p>
<p class="p1">away upon a poor girl, with no hopes or prospects but manual labor for</p>
<p class="p1">her living. And Zuleime, who could be thoughtful and benevolent in the</p>
<p class="p1">midst of anxiety and sorrow, proposed to give Catherine lessons on the</p>
<p class="p1">harp. But this was soon stopped. Both Zuleime and Catherine perceived</p>
<p class="p1">that the music, far from soothing, seemed to irritate the invalid. And</p>
<p class="p1">for this reason, Carolyn had lost her voice. She could never sing again.</p>
<p class="p1">And even in speaking, her tones were harsh and rough. The harp was</p>
<p class="p1">banished, and books were brought. And while Zuleime worked, and Carolyn</p>
<p class="p1">fondled a little King Charles, that had been bought for the childish</p>
<p class="p1">invalid, Kate read aloud to the sisters. And now it was that the world</p>
<p class="p1">of _written_ poetry broke upon the maiden’s delighted view. Before this,</p>
<p class="p1">she had never read a line of poetry in her life, except hymns—for Mrs.</p>
<p class="p1">Clifton had judiciously suppressed all books of that nature. But now the</p>
<p class="p1">treasures of Milton, Goldsmith, and Cowper, were opened to her ardent</p>
<p class="p1">mind! Oh, those days that followed the convalescence of Miss</p>
<p class="p1">Clifton—those evenings after Carolyn had gone to rest, when she and</p>
<p class="p1">Zuleime would go into the summer saloon and spend the hours in music or</p>
<p class="p1">poetry, or in talk as musical, and as poetic. Those evenings, spent with</p>
<p class="p1">a refined, warm-hearted girl like Zuleime—they were unfitting her for</p>
<p class="p1">her prospective hard life of coarse labor and coarser association. She</p>
<p class="p1">felt that it was so. And she determined to leave. She only waited until</p>
<p class="p1">Mr. Clifton went to Richmond and brought back his wife. And then she</p>
<p class="p1">bade them all good-bye and returned home—not to the farm-house of</p>
<p class="p1">Hardbargain, but to her brother Carl’s cabin.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">She needed to commune with herself, and be still. She wished to descend</p>
<p class="p1">into the unsounded abysses of her heart, and examine, though with awe,</p>
<p class="p1">the mystery of iniquity that in some unguarded hour had germinated</p>
<p class="p1">there—this growing passion for a man betrothed to another. No matter if</p>
<p class="p1">the marriage was broken off for the present. They loved each other. And</p>
<p class="p1">_that_ was the true betrothal. As for herself, she would, with the grace</p>
<p class="p1">of God, turn out this dangerous bosom guest, so divinely fair as to seem</p>
<p class="p1">like an angel of light rather than the tempting demon that it was! And</p>
<p class="p1">to do this effectually, she must break every tie that held her to that</p>
<p class="p1">fair illusive life she had lately led. She must forsake every</p>
<p class="p1">association connected with her sin and folly. She loved Mrs.</p>
<p class="p1">Clifton—loved her first for herself alone, and then as the mother of—one</p>
<p class="p1">whose name she dared not now to breathe even to herself. She enjoyed the</p>
<p class="p1">congenial society and occupations at White Cliffs and at Hardbargain.</p>
<p class="p1">And now she was the most welcome visitor on the list of both families.</p>
<p class="p1">But she must forego the privilege this gave her. More than all, she had</p>
<p class="p1">enjoyed her pleasant life at Hardbargain. The cheerful housekeeping</p>
<p class="p1">cares she had shared with its mistress—the conversations over the</p>
<p class="p1">pleasant tea-table or the social work-stand—the books, the newspapers,</p>
<p class="p1">and the evening music, and the society of the admirable Mrs.</p>
<p class="p1">Clifton—these formed the externals, the body of her happiness; but the</p>
<p class="p1">interior, the soul of her joy, was that _there_ was the home of Archer</p>
<p class="p1">Clifton—the place pervaded by his spirit! redolent of him! But all these</p>
<p class="p1">_must_ be abandoned! They might have affinity for her nature, but they</p>
<p class="p1">did not belong to her lot in life. And see what they had brought her to!</p>
<p class="p1">Even to an insane passion for her benefactor! And now it was high time</p>
<p class="p1">she had come to her senses and self-recollection. She was a poor girl,</p>
<p class="p1">of the humblest birth—born in poverty and destined to poverty. She must</p>
<p class="p1">leave off spending evenings with refined and accomplished young ladies</p>
<p class="p1">in elegant saloons, if she wished to do her duty in that station to</p>
<p class="p1">which God had called her. And she must give up the society of Archer</p>
<p class="p1">Clifton’s mother, if she wished to forget him. And she must betake</p>
<p class="p1">herself to the coarse, hard, but dutiful life of her brother’s cabin.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Catherine went no more to White Cliffs or to Hardbargain. And when Mrs.</p>
<p class="p1">Clifton sent for her to come and spend a day, she returned a gentle</p>
<p class="p1">answer that she could not leave her grandfather.</p>

<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">                </span>Her eyes unmoved, but full and wide,</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">                </span>Not once had turned to either side—</p>

<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">                </span>The circling white dilated grew—</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">                </span>And there with glassy gaze she stood,</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">                </span>As ice were in her curdled blood.—BYRON.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">The evening was chilly—just chilly enough to make the novelty of the</p>
<p class="p1">first fire of the season a luxury. And so Zuleime had ordered a bright</p>
<p class="p1">little fire kindled in the parlor, and the tea-table set out there. And</p>
<p class="p1">she had changed her white muslin dress for a fine crimson poplin one,</p>
<p class="p1">and began to think of the pleasant autumn evenings, when all the family</p>
<p class="p1">would gather around the hearth, with needle-work and books and social</p>
<p class="p1">chat. And, like a child, she was forgetting the threatening dangers that</p>
<p class="p1">lay before her, and those she loved—her father’s trouble, Major Cabell’s</p>
<p class="p1">expected arrival, Frank’s peril in distant warfare, the difficulties of</p>
<p class="p1">her own position—all were for awhile forgotten, in the dream of cheerful</p>
<p class="p1">fireside affection and comfort, as she moved about the room, closing</p>
<p class="p1">blinds, dropping curtains, and wheeling easy-chairs up near the fire,</p>
<p class="p1">and thinking with what a fine smile of genial satisfaction her father</p>
<p class="p1">would come in and look around upon the change before he dropped himself</p>
<p class="p1">into that largest easy-chair. Mr. Clifton had ridden to the village, but</p>
<p class="p1">was expected back to tea. And there sat the tea-table, a little aside,</p>
<p class="p1">to be clear of the chair, near the fire-place, and radiant with snowy</p>
<p class="p1">damask and shining silver.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Carolyn came in, pacing softly, slowly, and turning her eyes around the</p>
<p class="p1">room with a look of languid approval, she sank into an arm-chair.</p>
<p class="p1">Zuleime went to her immediately, and relieved her of the large shawl she</p>
<p class="p1">had worn through the chilly passages, and closed her dressing-gown, and</p>
<p class="p1">settled the lace border of the delicate little cap, and placed the</p>
<p class="p1">softest cushion under her feet, and then kissed her forehead, but did</p>
<p class="p1">not speak. Carolyn repaid her with a silent look of affection. Since the</p>
<p class="p1">departure of Catherine, Carolyn had sunk into a sort of mute</p>
<p class="p1">despondency, in spite of all the care and affection of her sister, for</p>
<p class="p1">it was her moral nature that needed help, and the young Zuleime could</p>
<p class="p1">not</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">                     </span>“Minister to a mind diseased”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Mrs. Georgia Clifton entered, and silently glided to her seat.</p>
<p class="p1">Unconsciously, Georgia became a dark and terrible picture. She sat upon</p>
<p class="p1">a low ottoman, at the corner of the fire-place, her head supported by</p>
<p class="p1">her hand, and all her glittering ringlets falling like a glory down each</p>
<p class="p1">side of her darkly splendid face. And through that strong light and</p>
<p class="p1">shadow her form palpitated, her bosom heaved and fell, her moist lips</p>
<p class="p1">dropped apart, and her eyes gleamed with a set, steady fire, as though</p>
<p class="p1">some passionate trance wrapt and spell-bound her soul.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Zuleime was moving about the room, and giving directions to a servant,</p>
<p class="p1">who had brought in cakes and preserves. Finally she sat down, and took</p>
<p class="p1">out her knitting—it was a pair of white lamb’s wool socks, for her</p>
<p class="p1">father—and knitted while she waited. She had not long to wait.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">The door swung open silently, and Mr. Clifton entered, with a newspaper</p>
<p class="p1">in his hand, but looking so shocked and troubled, that all, with one</p>
<p class="p1">accord, raised their eyes in silent inquiry.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Poor Frank! poor Frank!” exclaimed the old man, as if he was ready to</p>
<p class="p1">burst into a passion of tears.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“What!—what of Frank?” asked a faltering, gasping voice, which he could</p>
<p class="p1">not recognize as belonging to either of the three young women</p>
<p class="p1">present—yet answered, mechanically—</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Those bloody Redskins! Those ghastly, horrible Savages!” he cried,</p>
<p class="p1">throwing himself into a chair.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“There—there has been some fighting! Is——Tell me!—tell me! You know what</p>
<p class="p1">I want to know. _Is Archer safe?_” exclaimed Carolyn, bending forward.</p>
<p class="p1">While sallow and fierce, the eyes of Georgia gleamed the terror and</p>
<p class="p1">anxiety she dared not express!</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Archer is safe!” said Mr. Clifton.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">And the light of a sudden joy flitted across Georgia’s dark face,—and</p>
<p class="p1">Carolyn sank back, with a look of grateful relief. And no one noticed</p>
<p class="p1">Zuleime. And no one knew that she had spoken.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Yes! Archer is safe! Thank God! And a thousand times _thank God_, that</p>
<p class="p1">Archer is safe! But Frank!—poor Frank! My God what a fate! Who shall</p>
<p class="p1">tell his mother?”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“For Heaven’s sake!—what has happened to Mr. Fairfax?” asked Georgia.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“There! There! Read for yourself,” replied the old man, getting up, and</p>
<p class="p1">handing her the paper. He did not mean that she should read aloud,</p>
<p class="p1">perhaps—but he forgot—he was confused with trouble.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">And she took the paper, and read:—“FROM THE INDIAN FRONTIER; HORRIBLE</p>
<p class="p1">MASSACRE NEAR FORT PROTECTION.—Dispatches from our Western frontier</p>
<p class="p1">bring the most painful account of a horrible massacre of a part of our</p>
<p class="p1">troops by the Indians, in the vicinity of Fort Protection. On Monday,</p>
<p class="p1">the 15th ultimo, a small reconnoitering party left the Fort, under the</p>
<p class="p1">command of Lieutenant Fairfax. They had proceeded about a mile on their</p>
<p class="p1">way, when they fell into an ambuscade of Indians, and were cut to pieces</p>
<p class="p1">in the most shocking manner. The body of Lieutenant Fairfax, in</p>
<p class="p1">particular, was so horribly mutilated as to be scarcely recognizable.</p>
<p class="p1">The full particulars of the massacre, given below, are copied from the</p>
<p class="p1">‘National Sentinel.’”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Then followed a long account of the catastrophe, with every revolting</p>
<p class="p1">circumstance detailed with horrid distinctness. The old man heard and</p>
<p class="p1">groaned at intervals. Carolyn shuddered and wept by turns. And even</p>
<p class="p1">Georgia’s voice broke down for pity and horror. But _she_—the wife—the</p>
<p class="p1">widow—she—the fearfully bereaved—she sat and listened to all the</p>
<p class="p1">murderous story. She heard all—all. How he had been set upon by six or</p>
<p class="p1">seven—how he had singly battled with them, when all his party were lying</p>
<p class="p1">dead around him—how then he tried to escape such fearful odds—how he was</p>
<p class="p1">felled, and dragged down from his horse—the young, warm beating heart</p>
<p class="p1">was cloven through—the fair hair torn from the bleeding skull—the</p>
<p class="p1">fingers chopped off for the sake of the ring—Frank wore but one—a simple</p>
<p class="p1">gold ring, with a coral set, that she had taken from her slender fore</p>
<p class="p1">finger, and contrived to squeeze past the joint, and get it comfortably</p>
<p class="p1">upon his little finger. And they had cut it off in their haste to get</p>
<p class="p1">it. How real that trifle made the whole horror, that might else have</p>
<p class="p1">seemed like a nightmare! She sat and heard it all—all. And no motion, no</p>
<p class="p1">tear, no cry escaped her.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">At last, when the reading was over, and they were released from the</p>
<p class="p1">spell of horror, old Mr. Clifton thought of Zuleime, and feared its</p>
<p class="p1">effect on her. He turned to look at her. At first he saw nothing amiss.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">She sat so naturally, though still, with her knitting in her hands, as</p>
<p class="p1">though only stopped for an instant, and her face turned in a listening</p>
<p class="p1">attitude toward Georgia, who had ceased to read.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“It is all over—there is no more to hear, Zuleime, my darling,” said the</p>
<p class="p1">old man.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">But she did not move or speak. She seemed to look and listen intently.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Zuleime,” said her father gently.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">She remained perfectly still.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“_Zuleime!_” he exclaimed, in a louder tone. She did not hear.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“ZULEIME!!” he cried, a third time, going towards her, to seize her</p>
<p class="p1">shoulder.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">But he started back in affright. They were all gazing at her now.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“My God! she is DEAD!” ejaculated the father.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“She is MAD!” exclaimed Georgia.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">They gathered around her. She knew it not. She sat there as if frozen</p>
<p class="p1">into that attitude—her face white and hard—her lips bloodless and stiff,</p>
<p class="p1">and her eyes still fixed towards the spot from which Georgia had been</p>
<p class="p1">reading, but beyond it—beyond it—into the far distance, as if fascinated</p>
<p class="p1">by some spectacle there of unutterable horror!</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Zuleime! what are you looking at? Speak to me, my child!” cried her</p>
<p class="p1">father, in great distress.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">He might as well have expected a statue to speak.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Carolyn took the knitting away, which, through all this, had dangled</p>
<p class="p1">between her stiff, unconscious fingers. Georgia rubbed her hands.</p>
<p class="p1">Carolyn bathed her face. The old man cried to her—all in vain! They</p>
<p class="p1">might as well have performed these offices for the dead.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">They lifted her up, and laid her on a sofa—her limbs hanging helplessly,</p>
<p class="p1">like those of a dead or swooning girl. But she was neither dead nor</p>
<p class="p1">swooning. Wherever they moved her, her eyes were still fixed, in that</p>
<p class="p1">bright, burning, horrible stare, upon the distance, as though the vision</p>
<p class="p1">of the ghastly spectacle that had been conjured up before her</p>
<p class="p1">imagination, followed her wherever she was turned.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">They took her up stairs, undressed and put her to bed. All night long</p>
<p class="p1">she lay in the same state.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">In the morning there was no change, except that the muscles of the face</p>
<p class="p1">had fallen, the cheeks sunken, the chin dropped, and that concentrated,</p>
<p class="p1">intense gaze into vacancy, was more burning bright than ever. It was as</p>
<p class="p1">though a burning soul was consuming the unconscious flesh to death. Or</p>
<p class="p1">as if a body were turning to dust and ashes with the spirit still</p>
<p class="p1">imprisoned in it.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“She is sinking, and must die, unless she can be moved to tears,” said</p>
<p class="p1">the doctor.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">But what should move her to tears? Was there anything on earth that she</p>
<p class="p1">could weep for now? Her old gray father had knelt, weeping, by her</p>
<p class="p1">bedside, and torn his silver hair in anguish, without causing a single</p>
<p class="p1">eyelash to quiver over that fixed, burning eye! What should make her</p>
<p class="p1">weep? Plaintive music? She could not be made to hear it! The very songs</p>
<p class="p1">that she and Frank had sung together? The sound was drowned in the</p>
<p class="p1">groans from that scene of blood!</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Mrs. Clifton, of Hardbargain, had come over, but though she was a woman</p>
<p class="p1">of great skill and experience, all her efforts failed to rouse the girl</p>
<p class="p1">from that fearful trance, which seemed likely to end in death.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Send for Catherine! If any one in the world can do her good now, it</p>
<p class="p1">will be Catherine. There is, besides, a Free-Masonry between girls of</p>
<p class="p1">the same age, that makes them instinctively understand each other. If a</p>
<p class="p1">child were in a stupor, I should certainly send its favorite</p>
<p class="p1">playmate—another child—as the most likely being to rouse it,” said Mrs.</p>
<p class="p1">Clifton.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Ah! My Lord!—this is worse than any stupor! I wish to Heaven she would</p>
<p class="p1">fall into a stupor,” replied the father.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“I know it! For her mind is not dulled, but seems wrought up to the</p>
<p class="p1">highest pitch, and intent upon some imaginary vision of horror. She must</p>
<p class="p1">be brought out of it. She must be subdued. Send for Catherine.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Mr. Clifton went himself in the gig, to bring the kind girl.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">When Catherine arrived, and while she stood by the side of the stricken,</p>
<p class="p1">insensible girl, Mr. Clifton said to her—</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“You see, my dear child Zuleime seems to have been very much attached to</p>
<p class="p1">this poor young man. And the news of his horrid death was broken to her</p>
<p class="p1">suddenly, and it has just thrown her into this state! Look at her eyes!</p>
<p class="p1">What do you think they see—in imagination, I mean?”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“They see that scene of massacre—they see the death of her lover,” said</p>
<p class="p1">Kate, looking piteously at her friend—(for Zuleime _was_ her friend)—and</p>
<p class="p1">brooding deeply over some idea.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“The doctor says she must die if she cannot be made to weep! Oh, Katey,</p>
<p class="p1">my dear, _dear_ girl! If you can _only_ make her weep! I will give you—I</p>
<p class="p1">was going to say—I would give you half of all I have in the world! Come,</p>
<p class="p1">try! That’s a good girl! You girls all know each other’s little</p>
<p class="p1">fool-secrets and love nonsenses. Come, try. Do you want to be left alone</p>
<p class="p1">with her?”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Kate shook her head in that quick way usual to her when strong feeling</p>
<p class="p1">kept her silent—but she added—</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Give me her keys.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">The old man seemed surprised, but looked about and discovered the</p>
<p class="p1">required articles in her little work-basket, and handed them to Kate.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“I only want to search and see if I cannot find something that was</p>
<p class="p1">his—some little token or keepsake, you know.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">The old man took his station at the foot of the bed, while Kate pursued</p>
<p class="p1">her search. She knew what she was looking for, it was a curl of fair</p>
<p class="p1">hair. She had caught a glimpse of it once—when Zuleime had opened a box</p>
<p class="p1">in her drawer, and had immediately shut it again with a deep blush. And</p>
<p class="p1">now she knew whose hair it was; and that the sight of it would bring</p>
<p class="p1">tears to those burning eye-balls, and consciousness to that frenzied</p>
<p class="p1">brain. She found it. She could have wept herself as she raised it from</p>
<p class="p1">its little hiding place. She took it to the bedside—put her hand gently</p>
<p class="p1">over those glaring eyes to darken them, and break the spell if possible,</p>
<p class="p1">and then lifting her hand off again, she held up the lock of hair by the</p>
<p class="p1">end, letting it drop into a fair shining ringlet before the eyes of the</p>
<p class="p1">girl, as she said—</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Zuleime, do you know whose hair this is?”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">The poor scathed eye-balls fixed upon it—softened—melted from their</p>
<p class="p1">searching glare—a change came over her face—she extended her hand, and</p>
<p class="p1">caught the tress as if fearing to lose it, and pressed it with both</p>
<p class="p1">hands to her heart. Then her bosom began to heave convulsively, as with</p>
<p class="p1">a great coming agony. Catherine caught her up, for she seemed about to</p>
<p class="p1">suffocate. It was only the coming of the flood of tears—yes, the</p>
<p class="p1">_flood_, for she fell upon Catherine’s sustaining bosom, and sobbed and</p>
<p class="p1">wept—such a deluge of tears, that the girl’s dress was dripping wet, and</p>
<p class="p1">it grew a wonder where so much came from. And Catherine’s heart was</p>
<p class="p1">smitten, and she wept, too—wept till she grew so weak she could scarcely</p>
<p class="p1">sustain her burthen. And then old Mr. Clifton came around and relieved</p>
<p class="p1">her, taking Zuleime into his arms and laying her head against his</p>
<p class="p1">shoulder, saying—</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“There, cry! Cry on its father’s neck, as much as it wants to! It shall</p>
<p class="p1">cry its fill, poor thing! poor little heart-broken thing!”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">And she _did_, abundantly!—but pressed and kissed her father’s neck the</p>
<p class="p1">while for his tender words. This melted down the old man’s heart so that</p>
<p class="p1">he said—</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“They shan’t plague you! None of them shall! Charley Cabell shan’t come</p>
<p class="p1">here to trouble you! _That_ he shan’t. _Come what will_, you shan’t be</p>
<p class="p1">forced to marry him! No, no, my darling—my poor little heart-broken</p>
<p class="p1">darling, you shan’t! I’ll see him in perdition first! And myself, too!</p>
<p class="p1">There, don’t stop! Cry it all out on father’s neck! Don’t stop! Catch</p>
<p class="p1">your breath and begin again! That’s right! That’s a good girl! Oh,</p>
<p class="p1">she’ll cry a plenty this bout. Once I couldn’t bear to hear women cry!</p>
<p class="p1">It was because I did not know that if the grief was not cried out, it</p>
<p class="p1">would stay in the heart and burst it! I will never try to stop a woman</p>
<p class="p1">from crying again. Cry on, my poor little thing!” And so most tenderly,</p>
<p class="p1">but half-childishly, the old man talked, and petted, and cooed over her.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Catherine slipped down stairs to prepare tea and toast.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">When she came back, she found Zuleime lying back upon the pillow</p>
<p class="p1">exhausted, but composed, and still pressing the little lock of hair.</p>
<p class="p1">Catherine set down the little waiter, and took a bowl and napkin and</p>
<p class="p1">washed her face with cologne and water, and then brought the cup of tea.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Zuleime shook her head mournfully.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Catherine stooped and whispered.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“For your father’s sake, dear. Look at him.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Zuleime raised her eyes to the old man’s grief-worn, anxious face, and</p>
<p class="p1">then extended her hand for the cup, and drank the tea.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">While Zuleime was resting in Catherine’s arms and drinking the tea, a</p>
<p class="p1">knock was heard at the door, and when Mr. Clifton opened it, a servant</p>
<p class="p1">appeared and told him that Major Cabell had arrived, and wished to speak</p>
<p class="p1">with him.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">And the old gentleman set his teeth, and immediately went below.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">                              </span>CHAPTER XVI.</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">                       </span>MR. CLIFTON’S RESOLUTION.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">             </span>Full many a storm on this gray head has beat</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">             </span>And now on my high station do I stand,</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">             </span>Like the tired watchman in rocked tower,</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">             </span>Who looketh for the hour of his release.</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">             </span>I’m sick of worldly broil, and fain would be</p>

<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Well, old two pence ha’penny, how d’ y’ do? Family all well at last,</p>
<p class="p1">eh?” said Major Cabell, advancing to meet Mr. Clifton, as he entered the</p>
<p class="p1">parlor.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">The old gentleman extended his hand gravely, and welcomed his visitor to</p>
<p class="p1">White Cliffs. Then he rung the bell and ordered refreshments, but Major</p>
<p class="p1">Cabell declined the latter and inquired after the ladies.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“My family are all in affliction! D—n it, Charley, you know it! Curse</p>
<p class="p1">that Indian war! My dear Carolyn scarcely recovered from the effects of</p>
<p class="p1">that loathsome pestilence, before here comes the news of that hideous</p>
<p class="p1">massacre of poor Fairfax and his men, and just overwhelms my little</p>
<p class="p1">Zuleime!”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Zuleime? My dear little wife? I trust that nothing has been permitted</p>
<p class="p1">to afflict _her_?”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“The news of Fairfax’s horrible death shocked her into a sort of</p>
<p class="p1">appalled ecstacy, which lasted for twelve hours! And from which she was</p>
<p class="p1">only roused to break into such tears and sobs, as I never heard before,</p>
<p class="p1">and hope never to hear again.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">The old man wished to prepare Major Cabell, gradually, for the</p>
<p class="p1">announcement he intended to make of the marriage about to be broken off.</p>
<p class="p1">He wished to touch his heart, to excite his sympathy, to awaken his</p>
<p class="p1">generosity. He even hoped—for people will have wild hopes in</p>
<p class="p1">extremity—that Major Cabell might anticipate his wish, and resign his</p>
<p class="p1">claims. He never was more mistaken in his life!</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Major Cabell listened in grave silence to his speech, and then in high</p>
<p class="p1">displeasure, exclaimed—</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“By my soul, sir! this is a very astonishing and most offensive thing,</p>
<p class="p1">you tell me! Why should Zuleime grieve thus immoderately over the death</p>
<p class="p1">of this young officer. Will you explain that?”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Yes! I _might_ say—because he was her intimate companion in her own</p>
<p class="p1">home all the summer—and was soon after leaving it, so barbarously</p>
<p class="p1">slaughtered. That is quite a sufficient reason for the tender-hearted</p>
<p class="p1">child to grieve excessively. But I will not deceive you, Major Cabell.</p>
<p class="p1">She loved this poor young man!”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Sir! Mr. Clifton! By Heaven, sir!”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“It cannot be helped, Charley! Hearts cannot be bound by parchment and</p>
<p class="p1">red tape! She loved this poor Frank Fairfax—and her heart is broken by</p>
<p class="p1">his sudden, dreadful loss. Her grief, poor thing, must have its way! She</p>
<p class="p1">shall not be troubled!”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“And pray, sir,” began Major Cabell, speaking with deliberate scorn—“how</p>
<p class="p1">long shall this faithless girl be permitted to weep over the memory of</p>
<p class="p1">that fellow, before she is required to give her hand to one who might</p>
<p class="p1">have claimed it as his right long ago?”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“_Charles Cabell_,” said the old man, speaking slowly and sadly, “is it</p>
<p class="p1">_possible_ that you _can_—that _any_ man could wish to marry a</p>
<p class="p1">broken-hearted girl, mourning over the grave of her freshly murdered</p>
<p class="p1">lover!”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“_Wish_ to marry her? Wish to marry Zuleime? Give her to me! Give me</p>
<p class="p1">Zuleime! Only give her to me, and then see! She is my right! I claim her</p>
<p class="p1">by your promise—and I would take her _now_!”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“But you are certainly mad! You would be miserable with her!”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“_Should I?_ That is my affair! Only give her to me! Come! let me have</p>
<p class="p1">her to-day, or to-morrow, and I will take her home to Richmond with me,”</p>
<p class="p1">said Major Cabell vehemently, almost fiercely.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Old Mr. Clifton looked up at him in surprise, amounting almost to fear.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Have I ever described Major Cabell to you? He was a small man, with</p>
<p class="p1">clear cut, sharpened features, and pale face, surrounded by light brown</p>
<p class="p1">hair and whiskers, with very handsome dark brown eyes, but with a</p>
<p class="p1">certain latent ferocity in the eyes, and grimness about the thin, set</p>
<p class="p1">lips. Somehow or other he irresistibly reminded you of a</p>
<p class="p1">hyena—especially when he happened to laugh that thin, ungenial laugh.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">The old man looked at him in surprise, almost amounting to fear, and</p>
<p class="p1">then he said—</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“But she does not love you _now_! She cannot love you _yet_! She loves</p>
<p class="p1">Frank in his shroud better than any one left alive!”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“I do not care! She must forget Frank, and love me! Women can be made to</p>
<p class="p1">feel or feign anything, by one who understands them.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“But her heart is breaking, I tell you!”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“It must stop breaking, and nerve itself to life.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“She is weeping her life away! She is a Niobe, I tell you! A living</p>
<p class="p1">fountain of tears!”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“She shall dry them and smile! See if I do not make her do it! Pooh! it</p>
<p class="p1">is baby love, all this! Do you think a girl of her age, can feel any</p>
<p class="p1">lasting love, or grief, or enduring passion of any sort at all? Pooh,</p>
<p class="p1">pooh! I tell you if her lap-dog were killed, she would blubber and weep</p>
<p class="p1">as much over its death, as she does over this other puppy’s fate! But,</p>
<p class="p1">once for all, Mr. Clifton, I tell you I do not intend to be put off, or</p>
<p class="p1">in any way annoyed by this girl’s grief and petulance. It is not well</p>
<p class="p1">for you, her, or myself, that it should be indulged. Give her to me at</p>
<p class="p1">once, according to your promise, and afterward I shall know how to deal</p>
<p class="p1">with her—far better than you seem to know.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“And you really wish to marry her in her present state, and take her</p>
<p class="p1">home with you?”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Yes! What objection? A wedding-party is not an indispensable accessory</p>
<p class="p1">to the ceremony. A bridal journey from here to Richmond would be a very</p>
<p class="p1">good substitute. Indeed, since the catastrophe of the last wedding-party</p>
<p class="p1">at Clifton, I think the bridal journey would be in the best taste.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Umph! And you would marry her so, and so take her away?”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Certainly.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“_Brute!_”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Sir?”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“BRUTE, I say! She would rather lie down with Frank in his bloody grave</p>
<p class="p1">than marry you! And _I_ would rather lay my child there—ALIVE—than give</p>
<p class="p1">her to you! There, it is said! Now, I hope you understand me?”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Major Cabell brought his two fierce brown eyes to bear upon Mr. Old</p>
<p class="p1">Gentleman, and gazed as if he thought him bereft of his senses. Then he</p>
<p class="p1">spoke in a peculiarily thin, smooth, distinct voice—</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Do you mean what you say, sir?”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Yes I do! There!”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“And have you duly considered this, sir?”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Yes I have! There!”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“And you know and are prepared to meet the consequences?”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Yes! Do your worst! There!” said the old man, setting down his foot.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Major Cabell arose and walked up and down the floor in deep, perplexed</p>
<p class="p1">thought. To say that he was surprised at this sudden, unexpected</p>
<p class="p1">rebellion and daring on the part of Mr. Clifton would not be sufficient.</p>
<p class="p1">He was just _astounded_, and could not surmise where the strength of the</p>
<p class="p1">old man to oppose him, with his claims and his power, could come from!</p>
<p class="p1">He thought some external aid had been given! He never guessed that it</p>
<p class="p1">was the internal victory of conscience over cowardice.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Old Mr. Clifton also arose and stretched himself, expanding his chest,</p>
<p class="p1">and taking a long, deep breath of intense relief and satisfaction,</p>
<p class="p1">saying—</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Thank Heaven, I feel better. Feel more like a man than I have felt for</p>
<p class="p1">ten years. Now let the worst come, I can meet it!”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Major Cabell glanced sideways at him, and continued his thoughtful</p>
<p class="p1">pacing up and down the floor. He was possessed with a sort of ferocious</p>
<p class="p1">passion for Zuleime, a passion fanned to fury by opposition. He was not</p>
<p class="p1">one to bend his pride to sue. And yet he must have her! Soon, too!</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Old Mr. Clifton, now feeling and looking so much better and franker, and</p>
<p class="p1">remembering that Major Cabell was his guest as well as his relative,</p>
<p class="p1">went up to him and held out his hand, saying, heartily—</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Charley, give me your hand! I do not know what you are going to do, but</p>
<p class="p1">I know that I am ready to meet what comes! In olden times mortal foes</p>
<p class="p1">shook hands before they entered upon a deadly combat. In our times the</p>
<p class="p1">executioner and his victim exchange courtesies. And the humanity of it</p>
<p class="p1">is a touching comment upon the cruel necessities of our legal and social</p>
<p class="p1">code. Let us not be more ungracious adversaries than they. Give me your</p>
<p class="p1">hand. You are welcome to Clifton as long as you please to give us your</p>
<p class="p1">company. Sport is good now on the mountains, and you can amuse yourself</p>
<p class="p1">as you please.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Major Cabell paused in his walk, and placed his hand in the open palm of</p>
<p class="p1">Mr. Clifton, saying—</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“I will take you at your word, sir! I will remain your guest for a few</p>
<p class="p1">days. I will hope that what you have said in regard to the marriage of</p>
<p class="p1">myself and your daughter, has been spoken in haste, and under the</p>
<p class="p1">influence of anger. I trust that you will review your words. To-day you</p>
<p class="p1">speak from excitement—to-morrow I hope that judgment will dictate your</p>
<p class="p1">reply. You will remember that _I, too_, had something to complain of in</p>
<p class="p1">the fact that my affianced bride, or one that I considered such, should</p>
<p class="p1">have been so ill guided, or so illy guided herself, as to suffer her</p>
<p class="p1">affections to fall into this entanglement. But we will say no more about</p>
<p class="p1">it now, for I see Mrs. Clifton about to enter.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Georgia entered indeed, smiling.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Old Mr. Clifton seized the opportunity, and while Major Cabell was</p>
<p class="p1">paying his devoirs to the beauty, excused himself and left the room to</p>
<p class="p1">go and see how Zuleime was getting on, and to reassure her if necessary.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">As soon as he had left the room, Georgia drew Major Cabell off to a</p>
<p class="p1">distant sofa. And they sat down and entered upon a long, confidential</p>
<p class="p1">conversation. And when it was ended, they arose and separated with looks</p>
<p class="p1">of great satisfaction.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>

<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">               </span>Her look composed, and steady eye,</p>

<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">A few days after the incidents recorded in the last chapter, Mrs.</p>
<p class="p1">Georgia Clifton entered Zuleime’s room. The poor girl was sitting in an</p>
<p class="p1">arm-chair near the window, idle, as was never her habit before, with her</p>
<p class="p1">hands lying languidly one over the other, and her eyes fixed upon</p>
<p class="p1">vacancy.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">The beauty went to her with her soft, winning way, and took her hand,</p>
<p class="p1">and stole her arm over her shoulder, and said, tenderly—</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Zuleime, my love, do not sit here by this open window. Let me close it,</p>
<p class="p1">and lead you to the sofa.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">There is nothing so quiet as despair, except death. There is nothing so</p>
<p class="p1">docile as despair often is. The beauty knew this by a satanic</p>
<p class="p1">inspiration, and calculated on it. Zuleime suffered herself to be led to</p>
<p class="p1">the sofa, which was wheeled up near the fire, as she would have</p>
<p class="p1">permitted herself to be led any where else. Georgia sat down by her</p>
<p class="p1">side, and passed her arm around her waist, and said—</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“My dear, I think you love your old father—do you not?”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">The poor girl raised her eyes mournfully to the lady’s face, as if she</p>
<p class="p1">did not understand.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“You love your father. You would not be willing to see him ruined in</p>
<p class="p1">fortune, and degraded in honor, would you?”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Still Zuleime kept her eyes fixed upon the speaker, with an expression</p>
<p class="p1">of hopeless imbecility.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“My dear child, let me be explicit. And try to understand me, Zuleime.</p>
<p class="p1">It is of vital necessity to your father that you should. Will you listen</p>
<p class="p1">to me, Zuleime?”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Yes,” said the mourner, mechanically, without removing her gaze.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Well, then, you know your grandmother left you thirty thousand dollars?</p>
<p class="p1">Well. Your father owes debts amounting to twenty-five thousand dollars,</p>
<p class="p1">and is in danger of an execution or a prison, every day! You would</p>
<p class="p1">willingly give him your fortune to pay his debts with, we know. But,</p>
<p class="p1">unfortunately, you cannot do it, because you are not of age. Neither can</p>
<p class="p1">your father appropriate it, of course. But if you were to marry, then</p>
<p class="p1">your husband would be in legal possession of that property, and could</p>
<p class="p1">dispose of it. Now, Major Cabell has bought up your father’s notes to</p>
<p class="p1">the amount of eighteen thousand dollars, using all his available funds,</p>
<p class="p1">for the purpose of saving him from great distress, and in the</p>
<p class="p1">expectation of marrying _you_, his daughter, and obtaining your little</p>
<p class="p1">fortune, which would replenish his coffers again. Now, Zuleime, Major</p>
<p class="p1">Cabell is himself pressed for money. He would not, of course, come down</p>
<p class="p1">upon your father with an execution, but he will be compelled to sell</p>
<p class="p1">those notes again for whatever he can get for them. And then of course</p>
<p class="p1">the purchaser—some Jew or broker, would have no such scruples, but would</p>
<p class="p1">levy on all the personal property of his debtor, and most likely throw</p>
<p class="p1">him into prison, where he might languish for years—where he might die!</p>
<p class="p1">Zuleime! you will not suffer this, if you can prevent it, will you?</p>
<p class="p1">Speak to me, my love! I do not believe you understand me now! Why don’t</p>
<p class="p1">you answer me, Zuleime?”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“I—I don’t know. Yes I do. It was about a—about a—about somebody’s going</p>
<p class="p1">to prison. Was it the murderer? Alas, that will not bring him back.</p>
<p class="p1">Neither do I wish it. Not even _I_, who loved him so. I would not make</p>
<p class="p1">any body suffer, for the world. Oh, no.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">The beauty looked at the pale girl in deep perplexity a moment, and then</p>
<p class="p1">said—</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Zuleime, your _father_ is suffering! Let’s see if that will rouse you!”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“My father? Oh, no, he mustn’t. Tell him not to mind it. _I_ do not,</p>
<p class="p1">much, now. I know he is at rest. And we shall be, soon. Tell him not to</p>
<p class="p1">mind it.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Zuleime! Awake! Arouse yourself! Your father is in _danger_, I tell</p>
<p class="p1">you!”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“In danger—in danger. Tell me about it.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Listen to me, then! Rouse your mind! and fix it upon what I am going to</p>
<p class="p1">tell you about your father’s peril.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">And the lady took her hands and looked into her eyes, watching their</p>
<p class="p1">expression, and bringing back her wandering ideas every time they showed</p>
<p class="p1">the least sign of flying, and rousing up her flagging intellect every</p>
<p class="p1">time it betrayed a disposition to sink—and so repeated the whole history</p>
<p class="p1">of the difficulty over again. But the distracted mind of the poor girl</p>
<p class="p1">was scarcely able to follow the pains-taking narrator through the facts</p>
<p class="p1">of the case. Passing her hand once or twice across her corrugated brow,</p>
<p class="p1">she said—</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“What—what is it you say about father, and prisons, and Major Cabell?</p>
<p class="p1">I—I am afraid my memory isn’t as good as it used to be—please tell me</p>
<p class="p1">over again.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">The beauty, with a shrug of her shoulders, reiterated the story, placing</p>
<p class="p1">it in the fewest, simplest, and most direct words she could find. But</p>
<p class="p1">the stricken girl only looked sorely distressed and perplexed, and said,</p>
<p class="p1">plaintively—</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Please forgive me, and tell me what it is that threatens father!”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“An execution—that will sweep off all the furniture from the house, and</p>
<p class="p1">all the negroes from the plantation; parting husbands and wives, and</p>
<p class="p1">parents and children, and brothers and sisters, among those poor,</p>
<p class="p1">faithful creatures who love you so well. And for your father’s person, a</p>
<p class="p1">jail, where he may be for years, or until he dies.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Oh, pray don’t talk to me any more, my head is so wild, so wandering,</p>
<p class="p1">_it wants to go back to something_,” said the poor thing, pressing her</p>
<p class="p1">temples, and strongly attracted to her one great wo.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“But your father!”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Yes! Oh, only tell me what you want me to do!”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“To marry Major Cabell, who will then have the disposal of your fortune,</p>
<p class="p1">and can cover those notes and save your father.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“But—oh, yes! Now I remember. Father said there was no necessity! I</p>
<p class="p1">needn’t do it!” said the girl, pressing her finger hard upon the centre</p>
<p class="p1">of her forehead, and looking keen and old with the mental effort to</p>
<p class="p1">bring memory, attention and understanding to bear upon the subject.</p>
<p class="p1">“Yes, yes, yes, yes,—he said I should weep in peace.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Yes, your poor old father loves you better than himself. And he said</p>
<p class="p1">that sooner than you should marry a man you did not love, he would die</p>
<p class="p1">in jail.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Did he? My dear good father! Oh, yes! now I think of it, it _was_</p>
<p class="p1">something like that, sure enough! Only my head is _so_ queer! He must</p>
<p class="p1">not go to jail—oh, never!”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“He _must_, unless you marry Major Cabell, and save him.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Well, I can marry Major Cabell—it don’t matter much—do you think it</p>
<p class="p1">does? Spirits up in Heaven know _nothing_ of what is going on on earth,</p>
<p class="p1">or they know _all_ about it, and either is better than our deceptive</p>
<p class="p1">half-knowledge. If spirits know anything, they will know _our_ spirit.</p>
<p class="p1">Dear Frank will know—will know my spirit—nay, he does! I feel sure of it</p>
<p class="p1">at this moment. I will marry Major Cabell.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“But, Zuleime, if your father thinks you dislike Major Cabell, he will</p>
<p class="p1">not permit you to marry him.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“But I don’t dislike Major Cabell. I don’t dislike any one. I could not</p>
<p class="p1">now. It seems to me that I feel sorry for every one. I pity every one.</p>
<p class="p1">Every one has so much trouble, mamma! Mamma, I feel sorry for _you_. I</p>
<p class="p1">do not know how it is, but I _do_ feel _very_ sorry for you. Have you</p>
<p class="p1">any trouble?—You must have. Well, let God do as He pleases with you,</p>
<p class="p1">because He knows best. Besides, it is only for a little while. And it</p>
<p class="p1">will all come right. Kiss me, mamma. I don’t think I loved you well</p>
<p class="p1">enough when you first came here a stranger. Never mind, I will try to</p>
<p class="p1">love you more in the future.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Georgia let the poor girl kiss her, and then arose and made an excuse to</p>
<p class="p1">go. Zuleime was weakening all her purposes. And she was obliged to</p>
<p class="p1">escape as people fly sometimes from a sermon.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Please send Kate to me, mamma,” said Zuleime.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">And very soon Catherine entered.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Dear Kate! please come and comb and curl my hair, and put on my crimson</p>
<p class="p1">dress, and make me decent and pretty to go down into the parlor to see</p>
<p class="p1">Cousin Charles. It don’t matter, you know, Kate. Frank knows all about</p>
<p class="p1">it. He thinks so, _too_. Because he sees my heart is breaking all the</p>
<p class="p1">faster for it, and that I shall the sooner be with him. You see, Kate,</p>
<p class="p1">it is the heart-strings that hold the soul down to the body, and when</p>
<p class="p1">they snap—there! It is off—it is gone like a balloon,—when the cord is</p>
<p class="p1">cut it ascends to Heaven. _I_ feel light like that, sometimes, as if</p>
<p class="p1">only one little thread kept my soul down, and if it were to snap, I</p>
<p class="p1">could go.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Catherine looked at the mourner in deep trouble. Then she began to take</p>
<p class="p1">down her hair and comb its long sable tresses out, because she knew that</p>
<p class="p1">in itself to be a soothing process. And she stood and combed and brushed</p>
<p class="p1">it a long time, and then put it up, and bathed her face and hands.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Now, my crimson dress,” said Zuleime, quietly.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Catherine sat down by her side, and embracing her affectionately, said—</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Dear Zuleime, you are not quite well enough to go down into the parlor;</p>
<p class="p1">and, besides, Major Cabell is not here. He is gone with some gentlemen</p>
<p class="p1">upon the mountain to shoot birds.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Zuleime sat silent for a long time, enveloped by Catherine’s arms, and</p>
<p class="p1">leaning upon her shoulder. At last Kate whispered—</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Dear Zuleime, confide in me, and relieve your overburdened bosom. A</p>
<p class="p1">secret is so hard to keep alone in a sorrowful breast. Lay yours on my</p>
<p class="p1">heart, Zuleime, and it shall be safer there than my own life. Tell</p>
<p class="p1">me—what tie is it that binds you to Frank?”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Hush, oh, hush!”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Tell me, darling—you know it is not from curiosity I ask—it is that I</p>
<p class="p1">wish you to relieve your heart.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Hush! I promised him not to tell.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Death absolves you from that promise. A painful secret is very hard to</p>
<p class="p1">keep alone. _I_ know it, dearest, for _I_, too, have a secret. Now will</p>
<p class="p1">you trust me?”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Hush! hush! It was his last request—I must comply with it!” said the</p>
<p class="p1">girl, with wild eyes.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Catherine knelt down before her, clasped her arms around her, and partly</p>
<p class="p1">to win her confidence, and partly to draw her mind from dwelling upon</p>
<p class="p1">the wo that was crazing her, said:—</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Zuleime, look at me. I am going to tell you my secret, that which it</p>
<p class="p1">will pain and humble my heart to tell!—that which it makes my cheek burn</p>
<p class="p1">now only to think of! Zuleime, I love a man who never sought, and who</p>
<p class="p1">would despise my love! And with whom it is forever and forever</p>
<p class="p1">impossible that I should marry. Yet I love him so much—so much, that my</p>
<p class="p1">heart is ready to burst with its powerless longing to do him some good!</p>
<p class="p1">Zuleime, I would give him myself—(nay, never mind my cheek burning—I</p>
<p class="p1">will speak in spite of its protest)—or any dearest faculty or possession</p>
<p class="p1">of mine, if it only could increase his happiness. Zuleime, there is a</p>
<p class="p1">richness and fullness of joy in sacrificing one’s self for one we love</p>
<p class="p1">that passes all understanding.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“I know there is,” breathed the mourner, looking down in her face</p>
<p class="p1">seriously.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“That is the joy that I long for. And oh, believe me, I would sacrifice</p>
<p class="p1">myself or any possession or faculty I have, if it would only add to his</p>
<p class="p1">happiness or power. Eyesight is a precious treasure, is it not? If I</p>
<p class="p1">could give mine to him, and endow him with perfect vision down to deep</p>
<p class="p1">old age, I would consent to be dark forever. The power of speech is a</p>
<p class="p1">great gift—if by the loss of mine I could endow him with irresistible</p>
<p class="p1">eloquence, I would be dumb forever. _He_ thinks, Zuleime, that I have</p>
<p class="p1">talent. And sometimes _I_ think—but I don’t know, either! Anyhow, if by</p>
<p class="p1">yielding _all_ mine I could add a mite to the treasures of his</p>
<p class="p1">intellect, I would be willing to be a fool for life. In a word—if by</p>
<p class="p1">abdicating all my being, I could add to the largeness of his life, I</p>
<p class="p1">would glow with joy to do it.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Do not love him so! He will die if you do! _I know it!_ Frank died!”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“And yet, Zuleime, it is not that I wish to _lose_ my being, but to</p>
<p class="p1">_add_ to it. I do not know why it is, but I feel—not like an individual,</p>
<p class="p1">independent existence, but like the complement of that other existence—a</p>
<p class="p1">half life—not full and complete of itself, waiting to be joined to the</p>
<p class="p1">other half.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“He will love you. He will find you out,” said Zuleime. And her words,</p>
<p class="p1">and tone, and look thrilled like a prophecy to the heart of Catherine,</p>
<p class="p1">but she shook her head gravely, and answered—</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Never, Zuleime! It would be a sin even to hope it!——But, Zuleime, I</p>
<p class="p1">have laid my secret on your heart—_now_ will you confide in me?”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Oh, Kate! I would do it. I _wish_ to do it! But I promised him!”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Dear Zuleime, when he required that of you, he did not think what</p>
<p class="p1">might, what has happened. You must tell me, Zuleime. For if you have not</p>
<p class="p1">some one with whom you can talk freely, you—_I fear for you_. You cannot</p>
<p class="p1">bear your burden alone! Few human beings can! Tell me, darling?”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Oh, Kate! It was the last thing he asked me! I must comply with his</p>
<p class="p1">wish!”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Zuleime! I am about to cast away all reserve! I am about to tell you</p>
<p class="p1">the name of him I love so madly. It is Archer Clifton, your cousin—your</p>
<p class="p1">sister’s betrothed! There! I have thrown open the very sanctuary of my</p>
<p class="p1">heart to you. I have shown its secret sin and shame! Now, will you</p>
<p class="p1">confide in me!”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Dear Kate! Dearest Kate! My own secret’s without reserve, but not</p>
<p class="p1">another’s.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Catherine arose and took the seat by the mourner’s side. Well would it</p>
<p class="p1">have been for Zuleime in after life, if she could now have made a</p>
<p class="p1">confidant as well as friend of the excellent girl. But at least</p>
<p class="p1">Catherine’s efforts had not been all in vain. The mind of the mourner</p>
<p class="p1">was a little more rational—her part in conversation not quite so</p>
<p class="p1">_distrait_. Presently Zuleime said—</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“It is getting towards evening. Cousin Charles will be back to supper.</p>
<p class="p1">Curl my hair, Kate! and put on my crimson dress, I _must_ go down and</p>
<p class="p1">spend the evening with them in the parlor! I must, Kate. It is for my</p>
<p class="p1">dear father’s sake! You do not know, Kate, else _you_ would also advise</p>
<p class="p1">it.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Catherine essayed to prevent her, but finding her quite determined,</p>
<p class="p1">yielded the point, and assisted her to dress. When her toilet was</p>
<p class="p1">complete, she sat down again upon the sofa, and put her hand to her head</p>
<p class="p1">in troubled thought. Then at last she spoke, saying—</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Kate! I am afraid. It seems to me that—that my head has not been quite</p>
<p class="p1">right. And—and my speech has not been quite to the point. Kate, I want</p>
<p class="p1">you to tell me—can I trust myself to talk, do you think? or had I better</p>
<p class="p1">not try this evening? They might think me crazy if I should not talk</p>
<p class="p1">straight! But I am not! I am not crazy—only—Tell me how I am, and what I</p>
<p class="p1">had better do, dear Kate?”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Try to attend and be interested in what is going on, dearest, and talk</p>
<p class="p1">when occasion presents itself. And do not be afraid. Every one will</p>
<p class="p1">understand it is only nervousness, darling.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“You encourage me, Catherine,” said the poor girl, “and now just give me</p>
<p class="p1">your arm down stairs.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Kate complied with her request.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">The parlor was empty when they entered, and Zuleime had an opportunity</p>
<p class="p1">of settling herself in a large arm-chair, and composing herself, before</p>
<p class="p1">any one came in. Mr. Clifton, Major Cabell, and several other gentlemen</p>
<p class="p1">returned from the shooting excursion and entered the parlor together.</p>
<p class="p1">Mr. Clifton looked surprised and pleased to see Zuleime, “clothed and in</p>
<p class="p1">her right mind;” and Major Cabell seemed interested and curious. Zuleime</p>
<p class="p1">arose, and supported herself by resting one hand upon the arm of the</p>
<p class="p1">chair, while she received the greetings of her father’s guests. And</p>
<p class="p1">thanks to the shadowing of the black lustrous curls, and the reflection</p>
<p class="p1">of the crimson dress, none could see the wanness of her face. Mrs.</p>
<p class="p1">Clifton and Miss Clifton entered soon after, and in the general</p>
<p class="p1">conversation that ensued, poor Zuleime escaped particular notice. Once</p>
<p class="p1">Major Cabell contrived, without drawing attention upon himself, to find</p>
<p class="p1">his way to her side, and enter into conversation with her. And he was</p>
<p class="p1">surprised, perplexed, nonplussed at the gentleness and almost tenderness</p>
<p class="p1">of her manner. Before leaving her he asked—</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“When can I have an interview with you, Zuleime?”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Whenever you please, Cousin Charles,” she answered, gently.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">At parting, he pressed her hand, and to his surprise, the pressure was</p>
<p class="p1">softly returned. And he left her, thinking “the sex” more of a riddle</p>
<p class="p1">than he ever thought it before.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">The next day, about noon, Major Cabell and Zuleime met in the saloon,</p>
<p class="p1">and had an interview of nearly an hour’s length.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">When Zuleime left him and came out, she met her father in the hall.</p>
<p class="p1">Taking his hands in hers, she looked up in his troubled face and said—</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Dear father! you remember many weeks ago, you asked me to fix the day</p>
<p class="p1">when I should be married to Cousin Charles?”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Never mind, never mind, my dear! That is all over now! You shall not be</p>
<p class="p1">troubled, my love!”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Dear father, I have just told Cousin Charles that I will give him my</p>
<p class="p1">hand on Tuesday fortnight,” said Zuleime, and pressing both the old</p>
<p class="p1">man’s hands to her lips, she turned and left him standing there in</p>
<p class="p1">speechless astonishment, while she went up stairs—and throwing herself</p>
<p class="p1">upon her knees by her bed, buried her face in the clothes, and</p>
<p class="p1">breathed—“It won’t be for long, Frank! Oh! Frank, you _know_ it won’t be</p>
<p class="p1">for long!”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">                             </span>CHAPTER XVIII.</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">                           </span>THE YOUNG MOURNER.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">       </span>Mine after life? What is mine after life?</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">       </span>My day is closed. The gloom of night comes on,</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">       </span>A hopeless darkness settles o’er my fate.—JOANNA BAILLIE.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">There is no state of mind so calm as that of hopelessness. And,</p>
<p class="p1">therefore, there is none so often mistaken for resignation. Zuleime’s</p>
<p class="p1">cheeks were pale and hollow, her eyes heavy and sunken, and surrounded</p>
<p class="p1">by a dark, livid circle—and she had contracted an unconscious habit of</p>
<p class="p1">pressing her hand tightly over her heart, while a look of pain</p>
<p class="p1">corrugated her brow. Yet, withal, she moved through the house very</p>
<p class="p1">quietly—without a sigh or a tear—yea, even with a _smile_ for whom she</p>
<p class="p1">chanced to meet—a wan smile of tenderness, fellow-feeling. For the grief</p>
<p class="p1">that had come to her own young heart, had revealed to her the secret of</p>
<p class="p1">a general sorrow, and awakened a deep human sympathy. Yet perhaps it was</p>
<p class="p1">a morbid excess of this feeling that made her see, in every one she met,</p>
<p class="p1">a fellow-sufferer. Her father misunderstood her serenity and her sweet</p>
<p class="p1">smile. And his wife led him into that misunderstanding.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“It is a merciful provision of Heaven, that young people of her tender</p>
<p class="p1">age, can feel no lasting grief. At first, over any misfortune they</p>
<p class="p1">lament excessively. But it is very soon forgotten,” said Georgia.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Ah, yes! Charley Cabell said something like the same thing, and,</p>
<p class="p1">indeed, it seems to be true,” replied Mr. Clifton.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">We are easily persuaded to believe that which we wish to credit. And so</p>
<p class="p1">the old gentleman believed in the correctness of his wife’s judgment,</p>
<p class="p1">and in the reality of his daughter’s peace.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Major Cabell was baffled and perplexed. “Jealousy is as cruel as the</p>
<p class="p1">grave,” and so, also, is that base passion which often goes by the holy</p>
<p class="p1">name of Love. It had been under the influence of both of these that</p>
<p class="p1">Charles Cabell had sworn to punish Zuleime severely for what he called</p>
<p class="p1">her faithlessness. But for the present, at least, he was completely</p>
<p class="p1">frustrated. There was nothing to complain of in her conduct to him. She</p>
<p class="p1">was very kind and gentle—not with the gentleness of meekness and</p>
<p class="p1">humility, but with that of a compassionate toleration—such as an angel</p>
<p class="p1">might feel in looking down upon a determined sinner—seeing his moral</p>
<p class="p1">insanity, and foreseeing his consequent wretchedness. Major Cabell had</p>
<p class="p1">frequently heard of mourners who could not bear to hear the names of</p>
<p class="p1">their beloved, lamented dead, spoken before them. And he thought to</p>
<p class="p1">torture her bosom by frequently reverting to “that horrible massacre,”</p>
<p class="p1">and “poor Frank.” But he could not add one pang to those she had already</p>
<p class="p1">endured. Her sorrow was too deep to be probed—to be _touched_ by a</p>
<p class="p1">superficial hand like his. She could bear to listen and reply when he</p>
<p class="p1">talked of her massacred love. For like a stationary panorama of the past</p>
<p class="p1">and the present, his life and death were ever before her mind. She could</p>
<p class="p1">converse, without new emotion, of him over whose fate, in its deepest,</p>
<p class="p1">darkest horrors, she was ever brooding. If any mourners cannot brook to</p>
<p class="p1">hear the name of the lost mentioned in their presence, it is because</p>
<p class="p1">they are already blessed with long seasons of forgetfulness, and shrink</p>
<p class="p1">from the pain of remembrance. She had no such pang of sudden</p>
<p class="p1">recollection to dread. His memory—her sorrow—was ever present with her.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Catherine watched her with deep and painful interest. She sought an</p>
<p class="p1">opportunity, and once more had a serious conversation with her.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Zuleime, _don’t_ marry under present circumstances. If, as you say,</p>
<p class="p1">your father is in the power of Major Cabell, it is bad. But if you marry</p>
<p class="p1">him to deliver your father, it will be worse, and will not eventuate in</p>
<p class="p1">any good. And two wrongs never make a right, Zuleime. Do no wrong,</p>
<p class="p1">dearest, but trust in God for deliverance,” said Catherine, earnestly.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“It seems to me that I am doing right. It will please Cousin Charles,</p>
<p class="p1">and save father. And as for myself—it _can’t_ matter much, you know,”</p>
<p class="p1">replied the despairing girl. And to this view of the case she adhered,</p>
<p class="p1">with all the tenacity of a morbid resolution.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">A few days after this Catherine returned to her brother’s</p>
<p class="p1">cabin, wondering what new misfortune would—against her fixed</p>
<p class="p1">determination—throw her back among the Cliftons.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Major Cabell had written to Richmond for his mother and sisters to come</p>
<p class="p1">down and be present at his marriage. And one day, near the last of the</p>
<p class="p1">week, the carriage of Mrs. Cabell rolled up to the door. Knowing nothing</p>
<p class="p1">whatsoever of Zuleime’s attachment to the young soldier, and consequent</p>
<p class="p1">deep grief at his fate, they were very much shocked to see her looking</p>
<p class="p1">so ill, but quietly ascribed it to fatigue and anxiety in nursing</p>
<p class="p1">Carolyn. And Mrs. Cabell was emphatic in demonstrations of motherly</p>
<p class="p1">kindness, which the gentle girl acknowledged with grateful smiles, and</p>
<p class="p1">by such attentions as she had the power to bestow. The city ladies had</p>
<p class="p1">made a short stage that day, and were but little wearied, so that after</p>
<p class="p1">a little slumber, and the refreshment of the bath, and of tea, they felt</p>
<p class="p1">well enough to spend the evening in the parlor.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">The family were all around the evening fire, when Mrs. Cabell and her</p>
<p class="p1">daughters entered.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Major Cabell—who was as usual sitting by Zuleime, with his arm over the</p>
<p class="p1">back of her chair in a property-holding sort of manner—arose, and</p>
<p class="p1">handing his mother to a seat, received from her hand a roll of papers.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“It is some new music, my son, for the dear girls. There are some</p>
<p class="p1">beautiful songs of Moore’s just published. Carolyn, love, I have</p>
<p class="p1">thirsted to hear your sweet voice again. Will you sing?”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Miss Clifton’s eyes filled with tears, and she turned away her head.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Zuleime stole to her aunt’s side, and while seeming to examine the</p>
<p class="p1">music, whispered—</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Dear Aunt Cabell, Carolyn has entirely lost her voice!”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">The lady was very much shocked to hear it, and grieved at her own</p>
<p class="p1">unfortunate proposition, but durst not trust herself to reply, lest</p>
<p class="p1">Carolyn should hear and understand the subject of their conversation.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Major Cabell, who was turning over the music, suddenly had his gaze</p>
<p class="p1">fixed by one particular piece. His eyes lighted up with a peculiar</p>
<p class="p1">satisfaction, and turning to Zuleime, he said—</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“My own, you can read music at sight. Can you not?”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Yes,” replied the girl.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“And you can sing and play at sight—can you not?”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Yes, if it is not too difficult.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Is this difficult?” he asked, holding a page out to her.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“No, that is very simple,” said Zuleime, looking entirely at the</p>
<p class="p1">music—not at the words.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“It _is_ a ballad of Thomas Moore’s. I wish you to sing it for us. Will</p>
<p class="p1">you?”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Certainly.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Come, then,” he said, and took her hand, and led her to the piano. He</p>
<p class="p1">seated her, and laid the song before her, saying to himself, “If she can</p>
<p class="p1">sing _that_ through without emotion—ay, or _with_ emotion—if she can get</p>
<p class="p1">through it at all—she can do, or suffer anything! She is a heroine.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Zuleime was reading over the words, preparatory to singing them.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">And he was watching her intently. But she read through the song, turning</p>
<p class="p1">the leaves calmly, her pale cheek never changing its hue. Then she</p>
<p class="p1">restored the first page to its place before her, and began to play the</p>
<p class="p1">prelude. The ladies and old Mr. Clifton drew near, and gathered around</p>
<p class="p1">her. Then her voice arose, soft, clear and plaintive, but unfaltering as</p>
<p class="p1">her cheek remained unchanging—though her father trembled for her as the</p>
<p class="p1">words of the song fell on his ear. That song was “The Broken Heart,” by</p>
<p class="p1">Thomas Moore. Zuleime sang—</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">         </span>She is far from the land where her young hero sleeps,</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">           </span>And lovers around her are sighing,</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">         </span>But coldly she turns from their gaze and weeps,</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">           </span>For her heart in his grave is lying.</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">         </span>She sings the wild songs of her dear native plains,</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">           </span>Every note which he loved awaking:</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">         </span>Ah! little they think, who delight in her strains,</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">           </span>How the heart of the minstrel is breaking.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Her voice faltered—she paused.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Come! no miserable, maudlin, mawkish self-pity, I beseech you!”</p>
<p class="p1">whispered Major Cabell, stooping to her ear.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Whether Mr. Clifton heard the cruel whisper, or whether he only saw her</p>
<p class="p1">slight agitation, is uncertain—but he drew near and stood by her side.</p>
<p class="p1">She recovered, and continued—</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">          </span>He had lived for his love, for his country he died,</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">            </span>They were all that to life—</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">She paused again—again essayed to sing—her voice quavering, sunk into</p>
<p class="p1">silence like the rudely-swept strings of the harpsichord—the grayness of</p>
<p class="p1">death crept over her countenance, and she fell back into the arms of her</p>
<p class="p1">father, who angrily exclaimed—</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Charles! you are a brute! a demon! to ask her to sing that song.</p>
<p class="p1">Zuleime! Zuleime, my darling! speak to me!”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">He sat down on the sofa, holding her in his arms. The ladies drew around</p>
<p class="p1">with fans, with cold water, with hartshorn. But she recovered very soon,</p>
<p class="p1">and sat up—and declined going up stairs to bed—and thanked them all for</p>
<p class="p1">their care, gently begging them not to take so much trouble on her</p>
<p class="p1">account.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“This is all very strange, madam,” said Mrs. Cabell, aside to Mrs.</p>
<p class="p1">Clifton.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Zuleime is so nervous and sensitive ever since Carolyn’s illness, that</p>
<p class="p1">the news of that massacre, and the death of her old playmate and</p>
<p class="p1">companion, has quite overwhelmed her. I suppose this music awoke her</p>
<p class="p1">sensibilities,” said Georgia, composedly.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">If Mrs. Cabell had any suspicion of the truth, she was too well bred to</p>
<p class="p1">express it then and there. And the matter ended for the moment.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">But after this evening, Zuleime was never the same. Her fortitude seemed</p>
<p class="p1">entirely to have given away. Her calmness was utterly broken up. A</p>
<p class="p1">strange, wild terror and incertitude had come upon her.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">The next day, Mrs. Clifton, of Hardbargain, came over to call on the</p>
<p class="p1">visitors. Nevertheless, in the course of the call, Major Cabell found</p>
<p class="p1">the opportunity he sought, of taking Zuleime to task for what he called</p>
<p class="p1">her miserable weakness.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“You are unfaithful—false at heart—you cherish the image of this young</p>
<p class="p1">man secretly, while you pretend to be true to me! Pah! Well! why don’t</p>
<p class="p1">you answer me? Have you anything to say?”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Cousin Charles, does not the grave sanctify any affection? Is it a</p>
<p class="p1">crime to remember a dead friend?”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“It is a miserable, druling weakness! a maudlin, mawkish, drivelling,</p>
<p class="p1">puling piece of unfaithfulness to duty—and leads you into the exhibition</p>
<p class="p1">of such scenes as that of last night. Such whining, whimpering,</p>
<p class="p1">contemptible _self-pity_! I protest you are the most false-hearted and</p>
<p class="p1">selfish woman I ever met with in my life. It is _your own_ griefs and</p>
<p class="p1">regrets and reverses, that occupy you all the time. And now! instead of</p>
<p class="p1">listening to me, and replying—you are falling away into thought again!</p>
<p class="p1">Come! answer me, now! Was it not self-pity, that caused you to faint</p>
<p class="p1">during the singing of that _à propos_ song—which, by the way, I gave you</p>
<p class="p1">as an ordeal! Come! say! Wasn’t it self-pity?”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“_No, nor was it the song._ If I pitied myself, should I not pity _you_</p>
<p class="p1">as much? It is not such a happy fate, Cousin Charles, to marry a</p>
<p class="p1">grief-stricken girl like me, I know.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“_No!_ If I calculate upon your continued indulgence of that grief,</p>
<p class="p1">which I do not! _No!_ Trust me on the part of my wife, there must and</p>
<p class="p1">shall be no such exhibitions of feeling as that of last night.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“I do not know why you wish to marry me!” she broke forth, with strange</p>
<p class="p1">wildness. “You do not love me! Perhaps you hate me, and marriage will</p>
<p class="p1">give you the same power to work out your hate as it would to act out</p>
<p class="p1">your love! Yes! I do suppose that is really the key to the riddle!”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Perhaps it is,” he answered, sarcastically.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“One thing I beg of you,” she said; “while we stay here—in my father’s</p>
<p class="p1">presence—try to use me kindly—to spare his feelings—he is an old man.</p>
<p class="p1">Reserve your vengeance until I am your wife, until we get to Richmond,</p>
<p class="p1">when you will have full power, and ample time and space to work your</p>
<p class="p1">will.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">While she spoke so wildly, she pressed and rubbed her hand spasmodically</p>
<p class="p1">against her heart. And her pale brow was corrugated, and her intense</p>
<p class="p1">black eyes strained and sharpened as by mental and physical pain. She</p>
<p class="p1">gasped for breath, and began again.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“I do not know—I am sure—I cannot tell—whether, after all, we will ever</p>
<p class="p1">mar—”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">What she was about to say was cut short by the entrance of Mrs. Clifton,</p>
<p class="p1">of Hardbargain, who came in, with her shawl and bonnet on, to take leave</p>
<p class="p1">of Zuleime and Major Cabell, and invite them to join the rest of the</p>
<p class="p1">family in coming to dine and spend the evening at Hardbargain the next</p>
<p class="p1">day. Major Cabell accepted the invitation for himself and Zuleime, and</p>
<p class="p1">the lady took her departure.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">The next day was Saturday. The family set out on their visit at an early</p>
<p class="p1">hour of the day, as is the social custom of country neighbors. Old Mr.</p>
<p class="p1">Clifton, his wife, and his eldest daughter, rode in his carry-all. Mrs.</p>
<p class="p1">Cabell and her three daughters went in that lady’s carriage. Zuleime</p>
<p class="p1">rode on horseback, attended by Major Cabell.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">It was a glorious Indian summer day, when the splendor of the autumnal</p>
<p class="p1">sunlight would be too dazzling, but for the soft, warm mist spread</p>
<p class="p1">veil-like over it. At another time, Zuleime, true worshiper of nature,</p>
<p class="p1">might have drawn deep draughts of pleasure from the beauty of the scene.</p>
<p class="p1">But now the gorgeous magnificence of the forests, in their many colored</p>
<p class="p1">foliage—the misty mountain steeps softening the glory—the fine</p>
<p class="p1">transparent neutral tint of the heavens leading the eye and mind up</p>
<p class="p1">through infinite heights of ether—the glowing clouds reposing along the</p>
<p class="p1">horizon—all were lost upon her.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">An hour’s ride by the carriage road brought the party to Hardbargain.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Mrs. Clifton received them with her usual quiet cordiality. There was</p>
<p class="p1">something very composing in that calm, kind, self-possessed woman’s</p>
<p class="p1">manner. There was something very sedative also in the air of her home.</p>
<p class="p1">In her company and in her house the restless became quiet, the anxious</p>
<p class="p1">easy, the desponding cheerful, even the despairing mourners over some</p>
<p class="p1">great heart-wreck, grew languidly aware of how much good was left them</p>
<p class="p1">in the comforts of daily domestic life, and the amenities of social</p>
<p class="p1">intercourse.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">She was strikingly like her son. One was inclined to wonder how they—so</p>
<p class="p1">nearly identical in features and complexion—should differ so widely in</p>
<p class="p1">many points of character and sentiment, and had to remember that all in</p>
<p class="p1">which he did not resemble her was inherited from the Cliftons. Kate felt</p>
<p class="p1">the likeness keenly. And when the lady turned those quiet, brilliant</p>
<p class="p1">eyes upon her, her heart thrilled to the glance with strange pain and</p>
<p class="p1">pleasure. And when once or twice—for the lady was never very</p>
<p class="p1">demonstrative in her affection—she had quietly drawn the maiden to her</p>
<p class="p1">bosom—it was such a heart-feeding comfort, that Kate felt there would be</p>
<p class="p1">no possibility of forgetting Archer Clifton, while thrown into daily</p>
<p class="p1">intercourse with his mother. Once when Mrs. Clifton had looked tenderly</p>
<p class="p1">into her eyes, and drawn and pressed her closely against her breast, the</p>
<p class="p1">girl, lost for an instant, had thrown her arms around the lady, and</p>
<p class="p1">buried her face in her bosom. And for some time after that, terrified at</p>
<p class="p1">her own impulse, she had been as shy of the mother, as she could have</p>
<p class="p1">been of the son. Kate had kept away from Hardbargain for many weeks, but</p>
<p class="p1">to-day, when the party from White Cliffs had arrived, Mrs. Clifton sent</p>
<p class="p1">for her, with the message that her friend Zuleime had come. That was no</p>
<p class="p1">sufficient lure to the resolute girl, however, who had once for all</p>
<p class="p1">determined that nothing but the absolute necessities of others should</p>
<p class="p1">draw her again into the dangerous association of the Cliftons. She</p>
<p class="p1">returned thanks to the lady, declining the visit. Mrs. Clifton was</p>
<p class="p1">disappointed in missing the society of her young favorite for that day.</p>
<p class="p1">Yet the time passed very pleasantly notwithstanding. There is scarcely</p>
<p class="p1">any such thing as a stiff dinner party in the country. And such a thing</p>
<p class="p1">was impossible at Hardbargain. The ladies had all brought their “parlor</p>
<p class="p1">work”—fine netting, knotting, knitting, or sewing—and they worked and</p>
<p class="p1">conversed in a quiet, pleasant way, while the gentlemen mingled in their</p>
<p class="p1">conversation, or talked with each other upon the two reigning subjects</p>
<p class="p1">of country discussion—agriculture and politics—or sauntered out upon the</p>
<p class="p1">lawn to enjoy the fine autumnal weather until dinner. After which, the</p>
<p class="p1">ladies in the cozy parlor lounged a little more lazily, and grew a great</p>
<p class="p1">deal more kindly in their interchange of thought and sentiment, and the</p>
<p class="p1">gentlemen enjoyed a promenade on the piazza, and the stolen luxury of</p>
<p class="p1">their cigars.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">After an early tea the party took leave. They returned in the same</p>
<p class="p1">manner in which they had come. Zuleime on horseback, escorted by Major</p>
<p class="p1">Cabell; the others in carriages. Even the soothing influence of Mrs.</p>
<p class="p1">Clifton’s home and society had almost failed to quiet the miserable</p>
<p class="p1">girl. Her manner, all day long, had been erratic in the extreme—now</p>
<p class="p1">depressed into gloom—sunken nearly to the depth of stupidity—now full of</p>
<p class="p1">“starts and flows” as the crime-burthened Macbeth. As she rode home, in</p>
<p class="p1">perfect silence, the evil eye of her companion watched her stealthily.</p>
<p class="p1">Her cheek was pale and hollow, and her eye sunken and heavy. Yet</p>
<p class="p1">sometimes her eyes would lighten as with sudden terror, like those of a</p>
<p class="p1">startled hare, and her cheek would flush and fade. The road was broad,</p>
<p class="p1">yet shadowy, from the meeting of the branches of the huge trees</p>
<p class="p1">overhead. And so soon as the sun went down it became too dusky to permit</p>
<p class="p1">him to see the flickering and sinking of the fire in her eye and cheek,</p>
<p class="p1">but he watched her closely, nevertheless. Suddenly he saw her sway to</p>
<p class="p1">and fro in the saddle, like a reed blown by the wind. Then, ere he could</p>
<p class="p1">spring to her aid, the reins dropped from her hands, and she fell from</p>
<p class="p1">the horse, her foot catching in the stirrup. The well-trained palfrey</p>
<p class="p1">stopped, and stood without so much as lifting a hoof. With a deep curse,</p>
<p class="p1">Major Cabell threw himself from his steed, and raised her, disengaging</p>
<p class="p1">her foot from the stirrup. He sat down on a bank, with her on his knees,</p>
<p class="p1">and took off her hat, and began to feel her head, neck and arms, for</p>
<p class="p1">injuries. It seemed impossible to tell whether, or how she was hurt. The</p>
<p class="p1">carriages were some yards behind, and concealed by a turn of the road.</p>
<p class="p1">He dipped his hand in a run, at the foot of the bank, and sprinkled her</p>
<p class="p1">face; and before the carriages arrived, she had opened her eyes, and sat</p>
<p class="p1">up. She said that she was not hurt—that it was only a fainting spell,</p>
<p class="p1">such as she had had at the piano. But her voice was very weak, and her</p>
<p class="p1">frame trembling, and her general manner frightened. She placed her hand</p>
<p class="p1">against Major Cabell’s chest, partly to assist herself in rising, partly</p>
<p class="p1">to push him away, and stood alone upon her feet, until her father’s</p>
<p class="p1">carriage drew up. Then she said she was tired, and wished to get in.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Old Mr. Clifton sent a glance of impotent rage at Major Cabell, as he</p>
<p class="p1">lifted his child in—placing her in the vacant fourth seat—the other</p>
<p class="p1">three being occupied by his wife, eldest daughter, and himself.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Zuleime sat next to her sister, and opposite Georgia; and the last</p>
<p class="p1">mentioned lady studied her _vis-a-vis_, with as much interest, and with</p>
<p class="p1">far more curiosity and comprehension, than Major Cabell had exercised.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">The girl sat perfectly still, and quite lost to all around her. But</p>
<p class="p1">Georgia saw that it was the fearful stillness of self-restrained frenzy.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">They reached home at last. Georgia was handed out first, she waited for</p>
<p class="p1">Zuleime, who followed. She wished to draw the girl’s arm within her own.</p>
<p class="p1">But Zuleime, turning on her a dilated, strained, fiery gaze, fled past</p>
<p class="p1">her into the house. And then the lady saw, with a shudder, that it was</p>
<p class="p1">indeed the fires of incipient madness that kindled the lambent flame in</p>
<p class="p1">the girl’s eyes!</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">When they were all assembled in the parlor, around the evening fire,</p>
<p class="p1">with books, and music, and light needle-work—</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Where is Zuleime?” asked her father.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“She has retired to her room, very much fatigued,” replied his wife, and</p>
<p class="p1">the subject dropped.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">The next morning, when the family gathered around the breakfast-table,</p>
<p class="p1">the youngest daughter was still missing.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Where is Zuleime? Why doesn’t Zuleime come? Carolyn, have you seen your</p>
<p class="p1">sister this morning? How is she?” asked old Mr. Clifton.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Carolyn replied that she had not seen her since the preceding evening.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Send some one, then, to her chamber, to see how she is, and whether she</p>
<p class="p1">will join us at breakfast, or have anything sent up to her room.</p>
<p class="p1">Or—stay! Carolyn, don’t send—go yourself, my love, to your sister, it</p>
<p class="p1">will be only kind.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Carolyn left the table, and went up stairs, and after an absence of</p>
<p class="p1">fifteen or twenty minutes, returned, and announced, with a pale cheek,</p>
<p class="p1">that Zuleime’s chamber had not been occupied during the night—that she</p>
<p class="p1">herself was no where to be found in the house—and that no one of the</p>
<p class="p1">servants had seen her since the evening before!</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">A dreadful suspicion instantly seized upon all who remembered her wild</p>
<p class="p1">and moody looks and manners of the preceding few days; and they</p>
<p class="p1">simultaneously arose from the table, and with looks of alarm, dispersed</p>
<p class="p1">in various directions, in quest of the missing girl.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">The house, kitchen, out-buildings, negro quarters, garden, vineyard,</p>
<p class="p1">orchard, the plantation and the woods were successively and vainly</p>
<p class="p1">searched.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Messengers were dispatched to Hardbargain and to the neighboring</p>
<p class="p1">plantations, with inquiries that proved fruitless.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Old Mr. Clifton ran up and down the house and grounds like one</p>
<p class="p1">distracted.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">At last, near night, traces were discovered of the lost one. Upon the</p>
<p class="p1">edge of the stream, where the banks were soft and deep, small</p>
<p class="p1">foot-prints were seen—and half-way down the bank her little slipper was</p>
<p class="p1">found, with its toe deep in the mud, and the heel sticking up, as if</p>
<p class="p1">lost there in the downward run of its owner—and from the branch of a</p>
<p class="p1">sapling near, a shred of her crimson dress fluttered, as if caught and</p>
<p class="p1">torn off in the same swift descent.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Old Mr. Clifton walked down there, to see the spot; but he was _carried_</p>
<p class="p1">back.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">And before the next sun arose, Mrs. Georgia Clifton had her heart’s</p>
<p class="p1">first desire.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">She was a widow.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">                        </span>BROWNING—BLOT ON THE ‘SCUTCHEON.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">A retrospect of several hours is necessary here. You will remember that</p>
<p class="p1">during the drive home from Hardbargain, Mrs. Georgia Clifton had watched</p>
<p class="p1">Zuleime with much interest and curiosity, and with more perspicuity.</p>
<p class="p1">When the unfortunate girl had sprung from the carriage, and fled up the</p>
<p class="p1">steps into the house, Mrs. Clifton had followed her. Instead of going up</p>
<p class="p1">into her chamber, she had passed directly through the hall, and gone out</p>
<p class="p1">at the back door—Georgia having kept near her. There was the kitchen</p>
<p class="p1">garden at the back of the house, and then the vineyard, and then the</p>
<p class="p1">orchard—through all these she successively passed, with the same wild,</p>
<p class="p1">hurried gait, and entered the forest beyond, and descended into the deep</p>
<p class="p1">glen, through which the mountain-stream roared. It was very difficult to</p>
<p class="p1">follow the reckless steps of the fugitive down this rough declivity, and</p>
<p class="p1">while cautiously descending, with the aid of projecting fragments of</p>
<p class="p1">rock and smaller branches of trees and bushes, Georgia lost sight of the</p>
<p class="p1">girl. When she reached the bottom of the gorge, through which the</p>
<p class="p1">torrent raged and raved, Zuleime was no where to be seen.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">The night was very dark, and though a few large, brilliant stars were to</p>
<p class="p1">be seen directly over head, yet low from the horizon, heavy, black</p>
<p class="p1">masses of clouds were slowly rolling up. And the wind moaned and died</p>
<p class="p1">away at intervals—prophetic of the winter’s storm. The single, large</p>
<p class="p1">stars overhead were reflected in the stream—not clearly and calmly, but</p>
<p class="p1">plunging and leaping with the wild water. The banks each side lay</p>
<p class="p1">shrouded in gloom and mystery, rocks and trees indistinctly blended</p>
<p class="p1">together in dark and sombre hues. The everlasting mountains stood</p>
<p class="p1">around, vast, vague, and awful. The seven white peaks gleamed up in the</p>
<p class="p1">back ground, like the ghostly genii of the scene. A shiver of</p>
<p class="p1">superstitious fear shook the frame of Georgia, and she had turned to</p>
<p class="p1">retrace her steps home, when a sound between a moan and a suffocating</p>
<p class="p1">sob arrested her purpose. She crept towards the spot whence the sound</p>
<p class="p1">proceeded, and there, half hidden in the deep gloom of overhanging</p>
<p class="p1">willows, she dimly discerned the figure of the unhappy girl, bending</p>
<p class="p1">over the stream, and gazing intently upon the water, where the</p>
<p class="p1">reflection of the stars leaped and plunged with the waves. As if</p>
<p class="p1">communing with herself, she murmured—“There is peace there! There is</p>
<p class="p1">peace there!” Then her form bent lower, her gaze grew more earnest and</p>
<p class="p1">intense, as though body, soul and spirit were irresistibly fascinated,</p>
<p class="p1">drawn down by the glamour of the water! And—“There is peace, deep peace</p>
<p class="p1">there,” she muttered! How stormy must have been the soul that saw deep</p>
<p class="p1">peace in the raging torrent! Her eyes shone in the dusk with a bright,</p>
<p class="p1">phosphoric light, and still pouring their splendor upon the dark, wild</p>
<p class="p1">water, she murmured—“Peace! deep peace.” Suddenly up flew her arms, and</p>
<p class="p1">she sprang forward.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">The ready hand of Georgia caught her shoulder and pulled her back,</p>
<p class="p1">exclaiming—</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Mad girl! What are you about to do?”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Zuleime sprang around with her eyes all wide and ablaze, like one</p>
<p class="p1">suddenly waking up from a terrible dream, and not yet quite brought to</p>
<p class="p1">consciousness. Georgia drew her away from the dangerous proximity of the</p>
<p class="p1">torrent. Zuleime threw her hands to her head with sudden recollection</p>
<p class="p1">and intensity of consciousness, and sunk down at the feet of the lady,</p>
<p class="p1">clasping her knees, and exclaiming—</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Oh! you don’t know what you’ve done! Why did you pluck me back! There</p>
<p class="p1">was peace there! The only peace left for me!”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“You are frantic, miserable girl! _What_ is the meaning of this</p>
<p class="p1">madness?” asked Georgia, in a stern, curt tone. Convulsive sobs, shaking</p>
<p class="p1">as with a tempest the form of the girl, alone answered her.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“_What_ will your father—what will your intended husband think of this?</p>
<p class="p1">Say! Speak! What do you suppose Major Cabell—”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Oh! _do not_ speak of him!” gasped the girl.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Will you tell me what you mean by this conduct?” sneered Georgia.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Mamma—” commenced Zuleime but her voice broke down.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Zuleime! come get up and come home!”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Oh, no, no, no! _Not_ home! _Never_ home again!”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Once more, what am I to think of this frantic behaviour.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Mamma!”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Don’t call me mamma, if you please! It may not be pleasant or politic,</p>
<p class="p1">to acknowledge that tender relationship. But explain yourself, lest I</p>
<p class="p1">bring you to those who will demand the explanation with less</p>
<p class="p1">forbearance!”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Mercy! mercy! I will tell you anything! everything! Only do not kill my</p>
<p class="p1">father with the story!”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Speak, then!”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Lady—”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Well!”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">But some feeling stronger than fear, gripped her heart and stopped her</p>
<p class="p1">speech.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Zuleime! How long will you try my patience?”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Madam—”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Another hesitation.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“_What_, then?”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“I have been—a wife! I am—a widow! I am fated to be—”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Well,” asked Georgia, in a deep-drawn breath between her teeth, “you</p>
<p class="p1">are fated to be—”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“_A mother!_” breathed the girl, in a dying voice, covering her face</p>
<p class="p1">with both hands, and sinking lower on the ground.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">There was a long, deep pause, filled up with the roar of the torrent and</p>
<p class="p1">the moan of the rising wind. Suddenly up sprang Zuleime, with fire in</p>
<p class="p1">her eyes, and made a dash towards the water. The swift arm of Georgia</p>
<p class="p1">caught and dragged her back. No word was spoken yet. The impulse of</p>
<p class="p1">frenzy passed off, and Zuleime sunk into her old posture.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Get up,” at last said Georgia, half-shaking, half-putting the girl upon</p>
<p class="p1">her feet. “Get up and come with me.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">And she drew her to a fragment of rock, at a safer distance, pushed her</p>
<p class="p1">down on the seat, and dropped herself by her side.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Now, tell me of this,” she commanded, in a hard, curt tone. “You were</p>
<p class="p1">married?”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Yes, yes!”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Who was your husband?”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Ah, you know! You _must_ know! He who died in yonder field of blood,</p>
<p class="p1">under the tomahawk of the Shoshonowa—I am very wretched!”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Stay!—is this true—about the marriage, I mean?”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“True as God’s Word!”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Certainly the marriage was not legal without your father’s consent, and</p>
<p class="p1">would have been annulled by him. But now he will permit his consent to</p>
<p class="p1">be supposed. Let’s see! the widow of an army officer entitled to his</p>
<p class="p1">half-pay, perhaps; I do not know—perhaps to a pension, too, as he died</p>
<p class="p1">in the field of battle. Zuleime, upon the whole, I think that you were</p>
<p class="p1">rash to attempt suicide. Your position and prospects are not so bad. If</p>
<p class="p1">Major Cabell is anxious to possess you, now that he supposes you to be a</p>
<p class="p1">maudlin, love-sick girl, grieving yourself to death over the grave of</p>
<p class="p1">your lover, he will be quite as willing to marry you a year hence, when</p>
<p class="p1">he knows you to be the widow of Captain Fairfax—for _that_, I</p>
<p class="p1">understand, was his rank when he fell. Come, girl, live! Acknowledge</p>
<p class="p1">your marriage, like a truthful woman! Bring your child into God’s world</p>
<p class="p1">like a Christian woman! And after a sufficient time has elapsed, marry</p>
<p class="p1">Major Cabell, like a sensible woman! For I do assure you, that the</p>
<p class="p1">gallant Major is sufficiently enamored of your young beauty to wait that</p>
<p class="p1">length of time, if compelled to do so.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Ah, yes! I think he is enamored of me as the Shoshonowa was of poor</p>
<p class="p1">Frank’s hair!” bitterly said the girl.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“This marriage must be announced at once! Who performed the ceremony?”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Old Mr. Saunders, the Baptist preacher.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“What! He who was found dead in his bed.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Yes, yes, it was he!”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Pity for your sake that he is dead! But, you doubtless had some</p>
<p class="p1">confidant, some witness—Kate Kavanagh, perhaps, or some one else? Say!</p>
<p class="p1">speak! There was some witness to your marriage, who can be produced to</p>
<p class="p1">prove it?”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“No! There was none! It was _so_ sudden!”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“None!—no proof of your marriage? Yet stop—stay!—there is a chance yet,</p>
<p class="p1">I believe; I do not know. You were married with a license, of course?”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Yes, yes!”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“The county clerk who issued it will probably remember the occurrence.</p>
<p class="p1">That will be something in your favor, though, alas! only imperfect,</p>
<p class="p1">circumstantial evidence; for the mere taking out of a license is no</p>
<p class="p1">conclusive proof of a marriage.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Ah, great or small, as proof it is of no avail. The license was</p>
<p class="p1">procured _blank_, for Carolyn and Archer, because he had forgotten her</p>
<p class="p1">full name, and it was afterwards filled out with our names.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“No matter. You were married with it. And now I remember a saving thing!</p>
<p class="p1">The clergyman who married you of course affixed his certificate of</p>
<p class="p1">marriage to the license, and gave it to you. Where is it? All depends</p>
<p class="p1">now upon that. Where is it?”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“I do not know! I never saw it! If the parson gave one, probably Frank</p>
<p class="p1">took charge of it!”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Again a pause fell between them, and the noises of the wind and waters</p>
<p class="p1">arose in gloomy concert. At last Georgia spoke—</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Miserable girl! And so you have no proof whatever of this _asserted_</p>
<p class="p1">marriage?”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“None! none! But oh, what does that matter, after all? God knows that we</p>
<p class="p1">loved, and _were_ married, as He knows that we will soon be reunited!”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Wretched girl! who will credit the story?”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“No one in the world, perhaps! But, ah! what odds? Could the proving of</p>
<p class="p1">my marriage bring _him_ back to life, or give my father happiness?”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Most wretched girl! You seem quite lost to the shame you have brought</p>
<p class="p1">upon yourself! the dishonor you have brought upon your family!”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Ah, go on! You cannot say anything to me so bitter as my heart is</p>
<p class="p1">saying all the time!”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Your father! Your old, gray-haired father! to bring him to shame in his</p>
<p class="p1">old age! Can he survive the knowledge of your fall?”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“I know he cannot! I know it! Oh, oh!”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Carolyn, too! To destroy all her prospects in life. Who will ever wed</p>
<p class="p1">the sister of a supposed—”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Ah, spare me that! Why did you pluck me back! the river would have</p>
<p class="p1">covered all!”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Because I did not know or dream your folly! Zuleime, your father, who</p>
<p class="p1">could bear your death, could never survive your disgrace!”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Oh, God, I feel it!”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Zuleime—_you must die_!”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">A pause, when but for the roar of the torrent, and the howl of the wind,</p>
<p class="p1">their very hearts might have been heard slowly beating.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Zuleime, you must not live to bring shame upon us! You must die!”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Ah! Why did you hinder me when it would not have been a crime?”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“What mean you?”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“I was mad then! I knew not what I did! God would not have charged me</p>
<p class="p1">with my death! I am sane now!—sane, though most wretched!”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Zuleime, you must die!—not in reality, but in appearance. It must be</p>
<p class="p1">believed that you are dead—dead by your own act, as you intended. And I</p>
<p class="p1">will provide for your escape and your future support.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Alas! lady, what is it you advise me to do? Deceive my poor father, so</p>
<p class="p1">cruelly, and never, never undeceive him again? And never, never see him</p>
<p class="p1">again?”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Lost girl! if I had not saved you an hour ago, would you have been</p>
<p class="p1">alive to ask the question?”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Ah, no! But, oh, my father! Who will comfort him?”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Who would have comforted him had you effected your purpose this hour?</p>
<p class="p1">What would comfort him for your degradation? Foolish girl, that will</p>
<p class="p1">console him for your supposed death, which never could console him for</p>
<p class="p1">your fall—_time_. Besides, if you are supposed to be dead, it will not</p>
<p class="p1">only save us all from shame, but your father will be your heir, and can</p>
<p class="p1">appropriate that thirty thousand dollars to the payment of his debts.</p>
<p class="p1">Zuleime, it seems to me you owe us all this sacrifice.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“I—I am very weak and miserable. I—I scarcely know right from wrong! Do</p>
<p class="p1">what you please with me, only console my father!”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“And at any rate, girl, this plan is far better than the</p>
<p class="p1">self-destruction you meditated awhile ago. By this plan you will be able</p>
<p class="p1">to save your child.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Ah! to what end? To be as miserable as its mother?”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Zuleime! time presses. To-night you must journey to L——, and take the</p>
<p class="p1">stage thence to Richmond. I have a negro here on whose secrecy I can</p>
<p class="p1">depend; he shall take two horses from the stable and convey you to L——</p>
<p class="p1">in time to meet the Richmond stage. I will give you a letter that you</p>
<p class="p1">must deliver to its address as soon as you reach the city. Get up now</p>
<p class="p1">and come with me,” said Georgia, taking her hand to assist her in</p>
<p class="p1">rising.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">The unhappy girl mechanically yielded herself to the guidance of “the</p>
<p class="p1">dark ladie,” and they ascended the glen.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Retracing their steps through forest, field, orchard, vineyard and</p>
<p class="p1">garden, they reached the house, and entered by the back door. The hall</p>
<p class="p1">was deserted; the family being at that hour gathered around their parlor</p>
<p class="p1">fire, and the servants being at supper.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Zuleime, go quietly up into your chamber and get ready, while I go down</p>
<p class="p1">and find the man I spoke of,” said Georgia.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Zuleime mechanically obeyed——. The next hour, while her father and</p>
<p class="p1">sister and friends were enjoying their happy evening re-union in the</p>
<p class="p1">warm, bright parlor, the wretched Zuleime, through the dark night, and</p>
<p class="p1">the howling wind, commenced her journey. Of what followed the discovery</p>
<p class="p1">of her loss, you are already possessed.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">                            </span>A DOMESTIC SCENE</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">                     </span>A light, commodious chamber,</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">               </span>Looking out to the hills, where the shine</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">               </span>Of the great sun may enter.—MARY HOWITT.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Nearly twelve months have passed since the death of Mr. Clifton. It is</p>
<p class="p1">October, the most glorious month in the year, when the gorgeous beauty</p>
<p class="p1">of nature more than satisfies—when it enraptures the soul.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">I shall introduce you into a chamber, whose three large windows look out</p>
<p class="p1">upon the scene of glorious magnificence, only to be found when</p>
<p class="p1">mountains, vales and forests wear their gorgeous autumn livery. It is a</p>
<p class="p1">very large apartment, so long and lofty, that the great four-post</p>
<p class="p1">bedstead, standing with its head against the upper end, is not in the</p>
<p class="p1">way. At the lower end of the room, there is an old-fashioned fire-place,</p>
<p class="p1">where an oak fire is burning. The floor is covered with an ingrain</p>
<p class="p1">carpet, of warm, rich hues. The bedstead, lounge and cushioned chairs</p>
<p class="p1">are clothed with dark, bright chintz. The windows are curtained with</p>
<p class="p1">orange-colored damask, which give a mellow, autumnal tone to the</p>
<p class="p1">atmosphere of the room. The curtains are festooned back, to admit the</p>
<p class="p1">sunshine, and the glorious view without.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">The lounge is drawn up to the left of the fire-place, and Carolyn</p>
<p class="p1">Clifton, in deep mourning, reclines upon it. She is very much changed</p>
<p class="p1">since we saw her last. There is scarcely a trace of her disease</p>
<p class="p1">left—only a few pits scattered thinly over the lower part of the chin</p>
<p class="p1">and throat. But she is very, very fragile, and her thin, white face is</p>
<p class="p1">almost spectral, in contrast with her black dress. Her fair hair has</p>
<p class="p1">grown out richer, sunnier in hue than before. It is just long enough to</p>
<p class="p1">turn, in natural, smooth ringlets, that reach to her throat. And she</p>
<p class="p1">wears it so. And those bright curls soften and shade the pearly</p>
<p class="p1">whiteness of her cheek. The expression of her countenance has changed</p>
<p class="p1">also. It wears a subdued, almost patient air of suffering. She is</p>
<p class="p1">beautiful, although now that the roundness and bloom of her cheek are</p>
<p class="p1">gone, she does not think so. She is beautiful, as she lies there</p>
<p class="p1">contemplating, with remorseful tenderness, a miniature that she has</p>
<p class="p1">drawn from her bosom.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">In the cushion chair, on the right of the fire-place, sits Catherine</p>
<p class="p1">Kavanagh. She has also changed within the year. Her form is fuller,</p>
<p class="p1">rounder, more womanly. Her grave, almost stern features, have softened</p>
<p class="p1">into gentleness. Her voice is softer and deeper. Its tones indeed are</p>
<p class="p1">very beautiful, and modulated with every shade of feeling. She wears her</p>
<p class="p1">hair in the same old style, parted over the forehead, rippling down in</p>
<p class="p1">dark, bright wavelets around her cheeks, and carried behind, and woven</p>
<p class="p1">with the back hair into a large plait, and then rolled round and round</p>
<p class="p1">into a succession of rings—a rich, dark, burnished mass of hair—</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">                </span>“Golden where the sunlight played,</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">                </span>But where the tendrils sought the shade,</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">                </span>Dark, but very beautiful.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Her dress of dark brown stuff, with the little white throat-ruffle, and</p>
<p class="p1">the black silk apron, is not very becoming to her. But she thinks too</p>
<p class="p1">little of her personal appearance, to care for any quality in her</p>
<p class="p1">clothing beyond neatness and comfort. She is knitting very leisurely,</p>
<p class="p1">stopping occasionally to measure the stocking she is engaged upon with</p>
<p class="p1">the finished one which lies upon her lap. Kate is silent and thoughtful.</p>
<p class="p1">All her life, up to this date, has been passed in the ministry to</p>
<p class="p1">sorrow—yes, to all sorts of sorrow—to the suffering arising from vice—to</p>
<p class="p1">the despair caused by evil passions—to common illness—to pestilence</p>
<p class="p1">forsaken of all but her—to death! Yes! But little turned of sixteen</p>
<p class="p1">years of age, and to all these forms of human misery had she been—not a</p>
<p class="p1">ministering angel, but a ministering child and woman—that ministry of</p>
<p class="p1">sorrow had filled up all her years, from early childhood, to this hour.</p>
<p class="p1">Now her days were passed in soothing and cheering the solitude and</p>
<p class="p1">depression of her invalid companion. And Kate was grave and thoughtful,</p>
<p class="p1">because she was tempted to think that life was made up of nothing else</p>
<p class="p1">but trouble. Her hope in happiness beyond her experience was faint. Her</p>
<p class="p1">faith was dim. And no wonder. It seemed time she saw some one else’s</p>
<p class="p1">happiness, if not her own. It was hard to pour the words of faith, hope</p>
<p class="p1">and cheerfulness into the ear of another, when the fountain in her own</p>
<p class="p1">heart was failing. It was only a temporary darkening and failing of the</p>
<p class="p1">spirit. A silent, earnest prayer, and all was clear and strong again.</p>
<p class="p1">The room was provocative of thought, if not of pensiveness. It was so</p>
<p class="p1">still and warm and mellow, between the fire and the golden sunshine</p>
<p class="p1">coming softened through the curtains. And both girls were silent, while</p>
<p class="p1">Kate leisurely plied her knitting-needles, and Carolyn contemplated the</p>
<p class="p1">miniature. At last Miss Clifton spoke—</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Catherine, look upon that face. Study it. Should you believe, now, that</p>
<p class="p1">the owner of that beautiful face could be unrelenting, unforgiving?” And</p>
<p class="p1">she passed the miniature to her companion. Kate received it—glanced at</p>
<p class="p1">it. It was a faithful likeness of Archer Clifton. And those features, so</p>
<p class="p1">long unseen, and now suddenly revealed, thrilled with such electric</p>
<p class="p1">power to the heart of the girl, that after the first recognizing glance,</p>
<p class="p1">she instantly returned it. And though her heart had paused in its</p>
<p class="p1">pulsations, and now throbbed thick and fast, she answered, calmly—</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“He is not unrelenting or unforgiving, Miss Clifton.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Oh! he is! he is! It has been fifteen months since we parted in anger,</p>
<p class="p1">and no word or sign from him yet. Oh! Kate, what do you think of it?”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“I think he truly loves you, Miss Carolyn.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Oh! he _did_—he _did_, but I scorned and insulted him, and it is past,</p>
<p class="p1">past!”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“There is no past tense to real love, lady.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Ah, Catherine, you speak of what you have had no experience in. My</p>
<p class="p1">scorn killed his love.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Real love is immortal, lady, it cannot be killed.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Ah, child, you speak without knowledge.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Without experimental knowledge, Miss Clifton. And all the highest</p>
<p class="p1">truths we have are obtained without experimental knowledge. I know that</p>
<p class="p1">true affection is undying, by the same light that without the Bible</p>
<p class="p1">shows me that God exists—that He made all souls, and that all souls are</p>
<p class="p1">immortal. It is one of the ‘self-evident’ truths. Ah, Miss Clifton, true</p>
<p class="p1">affection can no more be killed by scorn, than an angel could be</p>
<p class="p1">overcome by a demon, than Heaven could be conquered by hell. In the</p>
<p class="p1">contest between true affection and scorn, it is affection must</p>
<p class="p1">conquer—scorn must yield. It must be so, lady. The heavens are pledged</p>
<p class="p1">to it. The sovereignty of the right is involved in it. And when, in such</p>
<p class="p1">a contest, affection fails, it is because it never was true. No, lady,</p>
<p class="p1">true affection is never conquered. It is scorn that is conquered. It is</p>
<p class="p1">scorn that has yielded now. You do not scorn him now, lady.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“No—I would I could!”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Then, in the death of your own scorn see the immortality of his love.</p>
<p class="p1">He will come back to you. He will come back the first free moment that</p>
<p class="p1">he has.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Ah, Catherine! In all this fifteen months he has not written to me.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“You do not know that, Miss Carolyn. _I_ believe that he has written to</p>
<p class="p1">you, and that the letter has been lost. You know how irregular and</p>
<p class="p1">uncertain the mail is from that distant frontier.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Catherine! I have been thinking of writing to him. What is your</p>
<p class="p1">opinion? What would you advise me to do?”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Not for the world, lady! For, trust me, for every step of advance a</p>
<p class="p1">woman makes, a man of high honor and fine sensibilities retreats.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Miss Clifton’s brow flushed, and she made a gesture, of impatience, as</p>
<p class="p1">she exclaimed—</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Then _why, why_ knowing that, does he not write?”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Because, perhaps, his first letters miscarried, and he stopped under</p>
<p class="p1">the supposition that you would not answer him. And then, lady, under all</p>
<p class="p1">these circumstances, the stiff pen and the cold paper cannot convey all</p>
<p class="p1">the burning words he would have to pour out at your feet. He will come!”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“‘He will come.’ Ah! in that very phrase is a knell deeper than all the</p>
<p class="p1">rest! He will come! And what a spectre he will see in me! He cannot</p>
<p class="p1">continue to love me! Impossible! Impossible! He can never love such a</p>
<p class="p1">faded and scarred ruin as I am.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Dear Miss Clifton, I have told you so often that you are _not_ a ruin!</p>
<p class="p1">Your face is very lovely, indeed it is! Fair and delicate and pensive,</p>
<p class="p1">and far more attractive to all good hearts than ever it was in its high</p>
<p class="p1">bloom.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Ah, but faded—faded—faded!” mournfully replied Carolyn.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“And then, dear lady, true affection is of the soul. It has been said</p>
<p class="p1">that love is blind. It is not so. Love has Divine eyes, and creates the</p>
<p class="p1">beauty that it looks upon. He will love you the more for the calamity</p>
<p class="p1">and sorrows that have fallen upon you. He will see a deeper beauty in</p>
<p class="p1">your pensive face, and his love will make it real.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Oh! impossible, I tell you! Impossible! The sight of me would shock</p>
<p class="p1">him. He would turn away.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Lady, do you love your cousin?”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“_Love him?_ Ah, God!”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Dear lady, if he had returned from the frontier with the loss of an</p>
<p class="p1">arm, a leg, or an eye—or with the hideous scar of a sword cut across</p>
<p class="p1">cheek and brow, could _you_ have turned from him revolted?”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Oh, no, no, no! Oh! Heaven, no! I should have done all I could to</p>
<p class="p1">convince him that he was beautiful to me still—that I loved him the</p>
<p class="p1">deeper for his misfortunes!”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Then, dear lady, judge his noble heart by your own.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Ah, but you said yourself, just now, when advising me not to write,</p>
<p class="p1">that men feel so differently from women!”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Yes, but not in tenderness—not in constancy!”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“There is the boy coming from the post-office, Catherine! It is</p>
<p class="p1">strange—it is strange—but though I have been disappointed a hundred</p>
<p class="p1">times, I still hope, and the coming of every mail makes my heart pause!</p>
<p class="p1">Go, dear Catherine, and see what there is.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Kate rolled up her knitting, and dropped it into a little straw basket,</p>
<p class="p1">and went below.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Only one letter, an’ the Pos’-Master say how it war for Miss Carolyn,”</p>
<p class="p1">said the boy below stairs.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">A letter for her at last! Carolyn’s heart stopped almost to death, until</p>
<p class="p1">Kate ran back up the stairs, entered the room, and placed the letter in</p>
<p class="p1">her hands.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“It is from Richmond,” she said, in a disappointed tone, as she opened</p>
<p class="p1">it.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“From my Aunt Cabell,” she added, and began to read it while Kate</p>
<p class="p1">resumed her knitting.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“I hope your friends are all well,” said Catherine.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Yes—” replied Miss Clifton; and then a smile of amusement flitted over</p>
<p class="p1">her face—and still running her eye down the letter, she continued—“My</p>
<p class="p1">Aunt Cabell writes me that my excellent step-dame, Mrs. Georgia Clifton,</p>
<p class="p1">is now the reigning belle of Richmond—the most beautiful woman, the most</p>
<p class="p1">charming musician, the most fascinating waltzer, and the most elegant</p>
<p class="p1">equestrian in the city! She passes for a wealthy (!) young widow—and her</p>
<p class="p1">credit is unlimited, and her debts and her extravagance, of course,</p>
<p class="p1">unbounded. She occupies a whole suit of rooms in the most expensive</p>
<p class="p1">hotel in the city, and entertains around her, both day and night, a host</p>
<p class="p1">of adoring worshipers. She has cut her father—worthy man—dead! She is</p>
<p class="p1">going to bring down a party of ladies and gentlemen to spend Christmas</p>
<p class="p1">at her country-seat, (!) White Cliffs. Now what do you think of that,</p>
<p class="p1">Catherine? Pray Heaven she may marry soon, and not wear our name long</p>
<p class="p1">enough to scandalize it! Mrs. Cabell goes on to say, that Mrs. Georgia</p>
<p class="p1">cannot long play that game—that Archer Clifton must soon return, and</p>
<p class="p1">take possession of his property, when it will be arrested. Alas! she</p>
<p class="p1">does not know that Captain Clifton is as much under the dominion of that</p>
<p class="p1">dangerous woman as it is possible to be. He will probably be proud to</p>
<p class="p1">leave Mrs. Clifton in possession here as long as she finds it convenient</p>
<p class="p1">or agreeable to stay. Now, what do you think of all this, Catherine?”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Dear lady, I know that you feel very unpleasantly, that all those gay</p>
<p class="p1">city strangers should be coming down here at Christmas, to turn the</p>
<p class="p1">quiet house into a hall of orgies. But I do not see how you can prevent</p>
<p class="p1">it. You can elude it, though! You can go to Hardbargain, you know, and</p>
<p class="p1">remain until Mrs. Georgia and her guests have departed again. I would do</p>
<p class="p1">that.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“No, dear Catherine, there will be no necessity for that, either! My</p>
<p class="p1">Aunt Cabell has anticipated my embarrassment, and proposed a plan. My</p>
<p class="p1">aunt and all her family are coming down here to spend the months of</p>
<p class="p1">October and November, while their city mansion is undergoing</p>
<p class="p1">repairs—painting, papering, and so on. And she proposes that I shall</p>
<p class="p1">return with her at the first of December, and pass the Winter in</p>
<p class="p1">Richmond.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“And will you go?”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“I do not know. But, Kate, dear, you have comforted me so much, and</p>
<p class="p1">aunt’s account of Mrs. Georgia’s city airs has diverted me so much, that</p>
<p class="p1">I think I have spirits for a ride. Go order the horses, and tell Dandy</p>
<p class="p1">to be ready to attend us. We will go up to Hardbargain and take tea with</p>
<p class="p1">Aunt Clifton, and amuse her with this letter!”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">                  </span>* <span class="Apple-converted-space">      </span>* <span class="Apple-converted-space">      </span>* <span class="Apple-converted-space">      </span>* <span class="Apple-converted-space">      </span>*</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Mrs. Cabell and her daughters, attended by Major Cabell, arrived in due</p>
<p class="p1">time, and were received with great pleasure by their orphaned relative.</p>
<p class="p1">And Catherine, now that she was no longer necessary to the cheerfulness</p>
<p class="p1">of Miss Clifton, took leave and returned to her brother’s cot. Life in</p>
<p class="p1">the mansion, and life in the hut, like day and night, about equally</p>
<p class="p1">divided the girl’s experience—a strange lot, to be ever alternating</p>
<p class="p1">between luxury and refinement, and poverty and coarseness. And though it</p>
<p class="p1">was a wonderfully strengthening discipline, Kate found the contrast so</p>
<p class="p1">painful as to wish that life would change—in some way.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">A month passed away—during which she heard nothing whatever from White</p>
<p class="p1">Cliffs. She was therefore in total ignorance of what was going on there,</p>
<p class="p1">until one cold morning that had succeeded a snow-stormy night, while she</p>
<p class="p1">was shoveling away the snow in front of the cottage door, Dandy rode up</p>
<p class="p1">and delivered her a note from Miss Clifton. The note ran thus:</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“DEAR CATHERINE,—</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“I am going to leave for Richmond with Aunt Clifton to-morrow morning.</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Come over, dear girl, and let me take leave of you before I start.</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Come, my good, wise Catherine, for I want to consult you about a</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>certain matter.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">                                                  </span>“Your friend CAROLYN.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Kate saddled her pony and set out, attended by Dandy. As soon as she</p>
<p class="p1">arrived at White Cliffs, she was invited immediately up into Miss</p>
<p class="p1">Clifton’s room. She found the young lady surrounded with trunks and</p>
<p class="p1">bandboxes, and busy with her maids, packing. Carolyn dismissed her</p>
<p class="p1">attendants, begged Kate to be seated, and sat down by her. After a few</p>
<p class="p1">mutual inquiries about health and so on, and a little introductory</p>
<p class="p1">conversation, and some considerable hesitation, Miss Clifton said—</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Catherine! I think—I hope that I have succeeded at last in emancipating</p>
<p class="p1">myself from the degrading slavery of that old love spell! At last the</p>
<p class="p1">dread sense of bereavement and desolation is deadened.... If I were to</p>
<p class="p1">see him again, however, I do not know how it might be.... Perhaps,</p>
<p class="p1">though, I shall never see him again.... Kate! I have had a proposal for</p>
<p class="p1">marriage.... My cousin Major Cabell!... It was at least generous in him,</p>
<p class="p1">all things considered.... Family feeling, I suppose.... Kate, I think of</p>
<p class="p1">accepting him!... We owe something to our position in society.... My</p>
<p class="p1">Aunt Cabell has been talking to me about it for a month past.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Miss Clifton made this communication in a hesitating, disjointed manner;</p>
<p class="p1">while Catherine looked and listened in grief and astonishment, feeling</p>
<p class="p1">regret amounting almost to remorse, that she had left her friend,</p>
<p class="p1">enfeebled in mind and body, so long under the influence of a</p>
<p class="p1">strong-willed thoroughly worldly-minded woman. And she understood the</p>
<p class="p1">instinct that had impelled the wavering girl to send for _her_ to steady</p>
<p class="p1">her. And then athwart these, her purest emotions, swept a dark, burning</p>
<p class="p1">impulse, like a breath of hell. It was the whisper of the devil, and it</p>
<p class="p1">said to her,—“Agree with her—agree with her! Let her marry another if</p>
<p class="p1">she wishes, and thus remove the greatest impediment that separates you</p>
<p class="p1">from the love, the hope of Archer Clifton.” Catherine stood for a moment</p>
<p class="p1">horrified by the darkness of the temptation. But then summoning the</p>
<p class="p1">whole strength of her soul, she inwardly exclaimed, “Get thee behind me,</p>
<p class="p1">Satan!” And the devil fled from her.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“You do not answer me, Catherine. My dear girl, I have so much</p>
<p class="p1">confidence in your rectitude of mind! Advise me!”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Dear Miss Clifton, _never_, as you value your whole life’s peace and</p>
<p class="p1">rectitude—_never_, for any purpose whatever—under any temptation</p>
<p class="p1">whatever—consent to marry a man you do not love; _never_, as you hope</p>
<p class="p1">for earthly content—as you trust in God—_never_ put an insurmountable</p>
<p class="p1">object between yourself and one you love! How criminal to become a wife,</p>
<p class="p1">while you love another living man! How terrible to find out, when it is</p>
<p class="p1">too late, that he loves you still! Perhaps from year to year to long for</p>
<p class="p1">the—! Lady, I have no words strong enough to express to you all that I</p>
<p class="p1">feel and fear on this subject! Grave faults sometimes follow little</p>
<p class="p1">errors! I would fain gain your promise not to entertain any gentleman’s</p>
<p class="p1">suit until you have met again with Captain Clifton. You cannot have long</p>
<p class="p1">to wait. He _must_ return to settle up this estate. And legal business,</p>
<p class="p1">if nothing else, must bring you together!”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Alas! alas! no! the affairs of this property will be settled by his</p>
<p class="p1">attorney. Kate, I am very miserable!”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Dear lady, I know it! Do not, when tempted by hopelessness, do that</p>
<p class="p1">which you may regret all your life! That which may shut out the</p>
<p class="p1">possibility of happiness forever! I wish I could go to Richmond with</p>
<p class="p1">you.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Oh, I wish you could! I think that you could save me from danger,</p>
<p class="p1">Kate.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“I think you want an honest friend near you, Miss Clifton! But, one</p>
<p class="p1">thing you can do—you can resolve not to form any matrimonial engagement</p>
<p class="p1">until you have again met with Captain Clifton. And you can bind your</p>
<p class="p1">resolution by a promise. Promise _me_, dear lady, by the interest I take</p>
<p class="p1">in you, to hold yourself free from entanglements, until you see your</p>
<p class="p1">cousin!”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Kate!—yes, I solemnly promise you, by all I hold sacred, that I will do</p>
<p class="p1">as you advise in this matter! And, Kate, enfeebled as I am, or may</p>
<p class="p1">become, in mind or body, I cannot break my pledged word! Good girl! You</p>
<p class="p1">have saved me again! Oh, Kate! Kate! do you think I don’t know the full</p>
<p class="p1">extent of your disinterestedness? Oh, Kate! noble girl! God reward you!”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Catherine began to tremble so violently, that Miss Clifton threw her</p>
<p class="p1">arms around her, and pressed her to her bosom, whispering,</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Never fear, dear girl! sweet girl! I will not breathe another word! I</p>
<p class="p1">would as soon sacrilegiously snatch the veil from the sanctuary, as</p>
<p class="p1">breathe another word about it!”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">                  </span>* <span class="Apple-converted-space">      </span>* <span class="Apple-converted-space">      </span>* <span class="Apple-converted-space">      </span>* <span class="Apple-converted-space">      </span>*</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">When Catherine reached home in the afternoon, she found a message</p>
<p class="p1">waiting her, from Mrs. Clifton, of Hardbargain. She went up immediately</p>
<p class="p1">to the farm-house, and found that lady looking very happy.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Catherine, my dear, sit down. I have good news. I have just received a</p>
<p class="p1">letter from Archer. He will be in Richmond in four days from this! But</p>
<p class="p1">his duties are such that he will not be able to leave Richmond for some</p>
<p class="p1">weeks. He begs me to meet him there! He has been promoted, Kate! He is</p>
<p class="p1">now Major Clifton, and has been appointed aid-de-camp to the Governor!”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“I am rejoiced to hear it, madam,” replied Kate, calmly, though her</p>
<p class="p1">heart stood still with the suddenness of this news. “You will send over</p>
<p class="p1">and inform Miss Clifton, will you not, madam?”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“No, I think not, Catherine. Why excite and disturb her on the eve of a</p>
<p class="p1">journey? Besides, Catherine, I have many misgivings! This long</p>
<p class="p1">persistence in silence—his never mentioning her name in any of his few</p>
<p class="p1">letters to me! his never replying to the letter I wrote upon the</p>
<p class="p1">subject!—all this is foreboding! I must not meddle farther in this</p>
<p class="p1">affair until I have seen my son, and can judge his state of mind in</p>
<p class="p1">regard to it!... But, Catherine, my dear, I sent for you for this: I am</p>
<p class="p1">going to Richmond on Tuesday, for the purpose of spending some weeks</p>
<p class="p1">near my son. I need a female companion, and I have your grandfather’s</p>
<p class="p1">and your brother’s consent for you to accompany me; that is, if you are</p>
<p class="p1">willing. Will you go with me, Kate?”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“I shall be very glad to do so, indeed, Mrs. Clifton!” said the young</p>
<p class="p1">girl.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Then return home at once, Kate, and prepare for the journey. You will</p>
<p class="p1">have a great deal to do, to make things comfortable for your grandfather</p>
<p class="p1">and brother during your absence, and to get yourself ready for your city</p>
<p class="p1">visit.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">                              </span>IN THE CITY.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">             </span>In a proud city and rich—</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">               </span>A city fair and old,</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">             </span>Filled with the world’s most costly things,</p>

<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">On her arrival at Richmond, Mrs. Clifton engaged for herself and</p>
<p class="p1">Catherine two rooms—a chamber with two beds, and a neat adjoining</p>
<p class="p1">parlor—in a quiet, retired boardinghouse.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Miss Clifton was the guest of Mrs. Cabell, in the most fashionable</p>
<p class="p1">quarter of the city. Captain Clifton had not yet arrived, but was daily</p>
<p class="p1">expected. Richmond was in the commencement of the fashionable season,</p>
<p class="p1">and was already quite full of gay company. Every evening witnessed some</p>
<p class="p1">one or two grand balls, or great private parties. The theatres and the</p>
<p class="p1">concert rooms were in full operation. But no faint echo of all these</p>
<p class="p1">various forms of revelry came to the sequestered neighborhood that Mrs.</p>
<p class="p1">Clifton had chosen for her retreat. No news of the fashionable world</p>
<p class="p1">reached her, except constant bulletins of Mrs. Georgia Clifton’s</p>
<p class="p1">progress through society. She was one of those city celebrities whose</p>
<p class="p1">sayings and doings are the exciting topic of all classes. Where she</p>
<p class="p1">went, and what she wore, and when she rode out. Whom she cut directly,</p>
<p class="p1">whom she smiled upon, whom she slighted, and whom she received, were the</p>
<p class="p1">most interesting subjects of discussion. The Belle of the Rappahannock,</p>
<p class="p1">the Dark Ladye, the Gipsy Beauty, were some of the many names she had</p>
<p class="p1">won. All these matters were freely and lightly commented upon in Mrs.</p>
<p class="p1">Clifton’s presence, by gentlemen boarders, who knew nothing whatever of</p>
<p class="p1">that lady’s connexion with the reigning toast of Richmond. Mrs. Clifton</p>
<p class="p1">rested two days before calling upon Mrs. Cabell and her family. Miss</p>
<p class="p1">Clifton expressed almost as much surprise as pleasure at the sight of</p>
<p class="p1">her aunt, but forbore to question her motive in coming so suddenly to</p>
<p class="p1">the city. Perhaps Carolyn had heard a rumor of Major Clifton’s</p>
<p class="p1">preferment and expected arrival, and for that reason was silent. Mrs.</p>
<p class="p1">Clifton never named the subject during her informal call. At taking</p>
<p class="p1">leave she left her address, and informed her niece that Kate Kavanagh</p>
<p class="p1">was in town with her. Carolyn expressed much pleasure at hearing this,</p>
<p class="p1">and promised to call very soon. The very next day Mrs. Cabell came in</p>
<p class="p1">her carriage, and invited and urged Mrs. Clifton and her protégé to</p>
<p class="p1">return with her, and make her house their home during their sojourn in</p>
<p class="p1">Richmond. After some hesitation and reflection, Mrs. Clifton accepted</p>
<p class="p1">the invitation, and promised to go over the next day. The next morning,</p>
<p class="p1">therefore, Mrs. Cabell sent her carriage to convey Mrs. Clifton and</p>
<p class="p1">Catherine. They were received by Mrs. Cabell with great politeness and</p>
<p class="p1">_empressement_, and conducted by that lady herself into two large and</p>
<p class="p1">luxuriously furnished chambers, connected with each other, where they</p>
<p class="p1">found a neat, pretty mulatto girl, ready to wait upon them—for Mrs.</p>
<p class="p1">Cabell, with all her hard worldliness, was truly kind and hospitable.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">The evening of the succeeding day was the appointed time for the</p>
<p class="p1">Governor’s first reception. Mrs. Cabell and her family were going, of</p>
<p class="p1">course. And Mrs. Clifton resolved to go—not for her own sake, but for</p>
<p class="p1">that of Catherine, whom she had determined should see all that was to be</p>
<p class="p1">seen during her stay in the metropolis. A somewhat haughty surprise</p>
<p class="p1">elevated the handsome black eyebrows of Mrs. Cabell, when she found that</p>
<p class="p1">Mrs. Clifton intended to take her _demoiselle du compagnie_, but she was</p>
<p class="p1">far too well bred to express it in any other manner. And as for Mrs.</p>
<p class="p1">Clifton, she always did whatever she thought proper to do, in the</p>
<p class="p1">coolest, calmest, most matter-of-course manner, without the slightest</p>
<p class="p1">regard to other people’s weaknesses and follies. You know, besides, that</p>
<p class="p1">she was a thorough republican. And Mrs. Cabell remembered that the</p>
<p class="p1">public reception at the gubernatorial mansion was a sort of _omnium</p>
<p class="p1">gatherum_, where all who behaved themselves might come—from the oldest</p>
<p class="p1">Major-General of the army to the shoemaker who made his boots. And</p>
<p class="p1">again, no one in Richmond knew who the girl really was. All these things</p>
<p class="p1">had Mrs. Cabell to recall to mind before she could reconcile herself to</p>
<p class="p1">the idea of Kate’s being of the party.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">When the night and the hour arrived, several gentlemen, beaux of the</p>
<p class="p1">Misses Cabell, came to escort the ladies. Major Cabell attended his</p>
<p class="p1">cousin Carolyn and one of his sisters. Judge Cabell took charge of his</p>
<p class="p1">wife and eldest daughter. Mrs. Clifton had hoped that her son would have</p>
<p class="p1">reached the city in time to have escorted herself and Catherine. When</p>
<p class="p1">they were all assembled in the parlor, Major Cabell brought a gentleman</p>
<p class="p1">up to Mrs. Clifton, whom he presented as Colonel Conyers, of the army,</p>
<p class="p1">leaving to Mrs. Clifton the responsibility of presenting the aristocrat</p>
<p class="p1">to the plebeian Kate. Mrs. Clifton did it at once, in the most natural</p>
<p class="p1">way in the world. And the gallant Colonel, after a few compliments,</p>
<p class="p1">hoped to have the honor of waiting upon Mrs. Clifton and her “lovely</p>
<p class="p1">charge” to the Mansion-House. Mrs. Clifton gratefully accepted his</p>
<p class="p1">services—and soon after, they entered the carriage, and were driven off.</p>
<p class="p1">This party reached their destination a full half hour before Mrs. Cabell</p>
<p class="p1">and family, and other ultra fashionables, who fancied that it was vulgar</p>
<p class="p1">to go early, and imagined that their _ton_ depended upon late hours and</p>
<p class="p1">other observances. Mrs. Clifton was very plainly dressed, in a black</p>
<p class="p1">satin with a lace scarf—Catherine very simply, in a white crape, with a</p>
<p class="p1">scarlet geranium twined in her black hair. A moment in the cloak-room</p>
<p class="p1">sufficed to re-arrange their simple toilet. They were then conducted</p>
<p class="p1">into the saloon. This apartment was fitted up in a somewhat different</p>
<p class="p1">style to those of the present day. It was illuminated by three large</p>
<p class="p1">hanging chandeliers, holding innumerable wax candles; and warmed by two</p>
<p class="p1">enormous coal fires, one at each extremity. It was already well filled</p>
<p class="p1">with a miscellaneous company. After their presentation to the Governor,</p>
<p class="p1">Colonel Conyers inquired whether they chose to join the promenade or to</p>
<p class="p1">take seats. Mrs. Clifton preferred the latter, and their polite escort</p>
<p class="p1">conducted them to a side sofa, from which they could note the entrance</p>
<p class="p1">of fresh guests, and watch the great circle of promenaders going round</p>
<p class="p1">and round in one long elliptic, three or four persons deep, in the most</p>
<p class="p1">stupid, treadmill monotony conceivable. Very much interested and amused</p>
<p class="p1">was our simple country girl, in taking observations of the various</p>
<p class="p1">characters passing in review before them. Here would be a dowager of</p>
<p class="p1">sixty, in rouge, ringlets, bare arms and a gossamer dress; here a girl</p>
<p class="p1">of seventeen, in a black, stiff brocade and heavy head-dress. Here comes</p>
<p class="p1">a stately, broad-chested, senatorial-looking man—he _looks_ the</p>
<p class="p1">incumbent of some high, official place—he _is_ the master tailor, of ——</p>
<p class="p1">street. Here comes a red-headed, red-faced, sharp-featured little man,</p>
<p class="p1">very quick and impatient in his motions, and very high in his voice—he</p>
<p class="p1">looks like an auctioneer or a constable—he is the great General ——, of</p>
<p class="p1">the United States Army. Here is a small, dowdy woman, all fuss and</p>
<p class="p1">flowers, like a barn-house actress—she is the wife of the late Governor</p>
<p class="p1">——. This is a queenly woman! tall, stately, dignified, with a fine,</p>
<p class="p1">royal countenance. Pooh! Don’t ask who she is—she is the “leading lady”</p>
<p class="p1">at the city theatre—plays in all the heavy tragedies, but is not even a</p>
<p class="p1">star. There, apart, watching and reflecting upon the scene, stands a</p>
<p class="p1">grave-looking individual, in a closely-fitting black suit, and</p>
<p class="p1">closely-cropped black hair, and set, sallow, saturnine face, looking</p>
<p class="p1">like an undertaker at a funeral—doubtless some famous preacher—though so</p>
<p class="p1">miserable a messenger of the glad tidings cannot be imagined. Preacher,</p>
<p class="p1">indeed! Why, he is H——, the low comedian, and he wears his hair cropped</p>
<p class="p1">that way by reason of the many different sorts of wigs he has to wear in</p>
<p class="p1">his different impersonations. To-night, he happens to be off the boards,</p>
<p class="p1">and enjoys the recreation of sadness and gravity. Ah! here is a</p>
<p class="p1">debonnair gentleman! all life! a laugh and jest, or a smile and a bow</p>
<p class="p1">for every one. Is he a French dancing-master? No—he is the Rev. Mr. ——,</p>
<p class="p1">the most popular preacher of the day. Yet these were not all. There</p>
<p class="p1">_was_ a small proportion of really well-dressed and dignified women and</p>
<p class="p1">stately, honorable men.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“How do you like the scene, Catherine?” asked Mrs. Clifton.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Kate laughed—then replied—</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“I am somewhat disappointed, but very much more diverted! It seems to me</p>
<p class="p1">so strange that people should look, dress and behave so very</p>
<p class="p1">inappropriately! and that they could possibly be so very ill-dressed and</p>
<p class="p1">dowdy at such a great expense. I expected something very recherché and</p>
<p class="p1">elegant in the saloon of the Governor’s mansion. But ‘motley is the only</p>
<p class="p1">wear!’”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">The officer laughed, gayly, and then observed—</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Why? Why did you look for something, or rather, for everything</p>
<p class="p1">recherché and elegant in this crowd? Because you see in the newspaper</p>
<p class="p1">reports of such gatherings, such phrases as ‘the beautiful Miss A——?’—by</p>
<p class="p1">the way, there she is—the young lady with the red hair, milk-white</p>
<p class="p1">complexion and little eyes; or ‘the elegant Mrs. B——?’ ‘the graceful</p>
<p class="p1">Mrs. C——?’ etc., etc., etc., with revised and improved accounts of their</p>
<p class="p1">costume, appearance, manners, etc.? Miss Kavanagh, when you have stayed</p>
<p class="p1">in the city longer, you will know that when a newspaper reporter and</p>
<p class="p1">letter writer speaks of that dowdy, but wealthy little woman, in the</p>
<p class="p1">flimsy, scarlet dress, as ‘the beautiful, elegant, and accomplished Mrs.</p>
<p class="p1">G——,’ and tells of ‘the immense (imaginary) sensation’ she made—_he_,</p>
<p class="p1">the reporter, is morally certain of an invitation to her private</p>
<p class="p1">parties.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Kate did not like his sarcastic tone, but before she could make any sort</p>
<p class="p1">of reply, her attention was called to a rising excitement in the room.</p>
<p class="p1">Every gentleman, from the fidgety little Major General, down to the</p>
<p class="p1">grave and dignified low comedian; and every lady, from the ex-Governor’s</p>
<p class="p1">fussy widow, to the stately and self-possessed stock actress, were on</p>
<p class="p1">the _qui vive_. Kate, while listening and watching for the cause of the</p>
<p class="p1">excitement, caught a few phrases that helped to enlighten her—they were</p>
<p class="p1">of this sort:—“A wonder! a perfect wonder! A miracle of dark beauty.”</p>
<p class="p1">“The wealthiest woman in the state, but that is nothing to her marvelous</p>
<p class="p1">beauty.” “Did you see her as ‘_Egypt_,’ at the fancy ball?” “Her</p>
<p class="p1">portrait, in oil, by ——, stands in Stationers’ Hall. It has attracted</p>
<p class="p1">crowds.” “No—I have seen the engraving from it in ‘Beauty’s Annual’ for</p>
<p class="p1">this year. But I have also seen it on the tops of cigar boxes—too bad!”</p>
<p class="p1">“Hush! here she comes!”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Catherine turned her eyes in the direction towards which all others were</p>
<p class="p1">gazing. It was Georgia—dark, bright, and more beautiful and bewitching</p>
<p class="p1">than ever. Her dress was of lustrous black _crape-de-lise_, sprinkled</p>
<p class="p1">over with gold spangles, that gleamed in and out through the dark,</p>
<p class="p1">transparent drapery, suggesting clear, starlight night. A crowd entered</p>
<p class="p1">with the star-bright Circe—a crowd attended her during all her progress</p>
<p class="p1">through the room.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">We must leave Georgia to her alluring wiles, and Catherine to her</p>
<p class="p1">observations, and seek Mrs. Cabell and her party. They are in the</p>
<p class="p1">dressing-room, and about to leave it. Only Mrs. Cabell turns again and</p>
<p class="p1">again to survey her form in the mirror, and re-adjust the flow of her</p>
<p class="p1">purple satin dress, or the wave of her white ostrich plumes. When all is</p>
<p class="p1">done, she turns for the last time to Carolyn, to rebuke her for not</p>
<p class="p1">adding a single ornament to her mourning dress of black velvet, which is</p>
<p class="p1">relieved only by the falls of fine Brussels lace on the neck and arms,</p>
<p class="p1">and the sunny ringlets falling all around her head as low as the throat.</p>
<p class="p1">Carolyn looks very fragile, but interesting and lovely, though she does</p>
<p class="p1">not know it. Major Cabell gave his right arm to his mother, and his left</p>
<p class="p1">to his cousin, and so, as it was now the acme of the fashionable hour,</p>
<p class="p1">they entered the saloon, and made their slow progress up to the upper</p>
<p class="p1">end, where the Governor and staff stood, to receive all comers—Mrs.</p>
<p class="p1">Cabell bowing and smiling to such acquaintances as she chose to</p>
<p class="p1">recognize in passing, until at length they stopped. A feeling of false</p>
<p class="p1">shame, a morbid notion that all eyes were upon her, and scrutinized the</p>
<p class="p1">few pits hidden under the golden curls on her temples, had caused</p>
<p class="p1">Carolyn to cast her eyes down, and keep them down, during the whole</p>
<p class="p1">progress through the room—and though her acute ears heard such murmurs</p>
<p class="p1">as these—“How fair she is,” “But how fragile, as if a zephyr would blow</p>
<p class="p1">her away”—she never fancied they were breathed of her, and never</p>
<p class="p1">surmised the admiration she elicited. “Governor T——, Miss Clifton, of</p>
<p class="p1">Clifton,” were the words that admonished Carolyn she was standing before</p>
<p class="p1">the great man, and must look up and curtsy. She curtsied before she</p>
<p class="p1">looked up, and when she raised her eyes, she saw only Archer Clifton</p>
<p class="p1">before her, who bowed when he met her glance! The Governor and many</p>
<p class="p1">others were there, but how could she see any one but Archer Clifton!</p>
<p class="p1">But, oh! the perversity of human nature! As soon as she met his eyes,</p>
<p class="p1">all the pride and scorn of her proudest, most scornful days, returned</p>
<p class="p1">upon her with a vengeance—all the more fiercely, ferociously, that she</p>
<p class="p1">believed herself a fright, and found Archer Clifton handsomer, more</p>
<p class="p1">dignified, higher in favor with God and man than ever! Major Cabell was</p>
<p class="p1">about to pass on instantly with his ladies, to give place to the next</p>
<p class="p1">arrivals. Returning Archer Clifton’s bow with a haughty bend, she threw</p>
<p class="p1">up her head and swept on with the most superb air of arrogance</p>
<p class="p1">imaginable. They joined the promenaders—Carolyn all the more unhappy for</p>
<p class="p1">her show of hauteur—the heart beneath that erected head and expanded</p>
<p class="p1">chest almost breaking with chagrin. Captain, now Major Clifton, stood at</p>
<p class="p1">the right hand of the Governor, with his eyes roving calmly over the</p>
<p class="p1">miscellaneous assembly, until they chanced to rest upon the stately form</p>
<p class="p1">of his mother when they lighted up with surprise and pleasure, and</p>
<p class="p1">excusing himself from his official attendance, he bowed and withdrew, to</p>
<p class="p1">hasten to the distant sofa, where she sat alone. Catherine, on the arm</p>
<p class="p1">of Colonel Conyers, was lost in the slowly revolving crowd of</p>
<p class="p1">promenaders. He reached Mrs. Clifton’s side, and—</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“My dearest mother!”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“My dear Archer!” were the greetings exchanged between them with the</p>
<p class="p1">clasped hands.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“How delighted I am to see you, yet how tantalizing to meet you in this</p>
<p class="p1">public assembly, after so long an absence!”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“When did you reach the city, Archer?”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Within the last half hour! Having important dispatches for the</p>
<p class="p1">Governor, I came at once hither.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“I did not see you enter.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“I came in by the private entrance, and joined his excellency’s circle</p>
<p class="p1">directly. But, my dearest mother! I scarcely hoped you would be in</p>
<p class="p1">town—how long have you been here?”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“About four days, Archer.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Suddenly both became grave and thoughtful—they were occupied with the</p>
<p class="p1">same thoughts—of the calamities that had befallen mutual friends since</p>
<p class="p1">their last parting. They were silent—they did not like to sadden this</p>
<p class="p1">first meeting by referring to the mournful subject. And before either</p>
<p class="p1">knew of her approach, Mrs. Georgia had glided swiftly and silently up to</p>
<p class="p1">them. Now, Mrs. Georgia had passed and repassed Mrs. Clifton a score of</p>
<p class="p1">times that evening, without once noticing her. But now that Archer</p>
<p class="p1">Clifton sat by his mother’s side, the Circe appeared before them, dark,</p>
<p class="p1">resplendent, alluring as ever. She was leaning upon the arm of the</p>
<p class="p1">Lieutenant-Governor. Archer Clifton sprang up immediately, and greeted</p>
<p class="p1">her with surprise and pleasure. Dismissing her escort with a charming</p>
<p class="p1">smile and wave of the hand she sank gracefully, languishingly into the</p>
<p class="p1">seat by the side of Mrs. Clifton, and glided into her own fascinating</p>
<p class="p1">style of conversation. After a few minutes, Archer Clifton seemed quite</p>
<p class="p1">lost to everything else, in the charm of the syren’s society, until a</p>
<p class="p1">certain, sweet, enticing restlessness on the part of the beauty,</p>
<p class="p1">suggested to him the propriety of inviting her to promenade. She arose</p>
<p class="p1">with a bewildering smile, that quite drove his mother out of his head,</p>
<p class="p1">and slipped her arm through his. They joined the promenaders. In the</p>
<p class="p1">meantime, Kate Kavanagh, on the arm of Colonel Conyers, was moving</p>
<p class="p1">around in the same circle, highly amused in making observations, and</p>
<p class="p1">scarcely appreciating the sincere admiration of her escort, that was</p>
<p class="p1">apparent to every one else, especially to the correspondent of the</p>
<p class="p1">Fiddle-de-dee, who, in his next letter, in giving an account of the</p>
<p class="p1">reception, made an item of the manifest admiration of the gallant and</p>
<p class="p1">distinguished Colonel C——, for the beautiful and accomplished Miss K——.</p>
<p class="p1">Catherine at length thought that her kind patroness might be lonely, and</p>
<p class="p1">expressed a wish to rejoin her. In turning to retrace their steps, they</p>
<p class="p1">met face to face with Archer Clifton and his companion. Major Clifton</p>
<p class="p1">recognized the poor mountain-girl in that saloon, with a look of</p>
<p class="p1">supercilious surprise, and Mrs. Georgia looked calmly through her body</p>
<p class="p1">without seeing her at all. With a slight bow, Major Clifton passed on</p>
<p class="p1">with his companion. And as for Kate, her heart had a habit of standing</p>
<p class="p1">perfectly still in an emergency, and now it had stopped so suddenly, and</p>
<p class="p1">stood still so long, that she was on the verge of fainting.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“You are not well. You are wearied. You have remained on your feet too</p>
<p class="p1">long. Let me take you to a seat, Miss Kavanagh,” said the Colonel. With</p>
<p class="p1">a gasp and a shiver, Kate recovered and rejoined Mrs. Clifton. And she</p>
<p class="p1">permitted herself to fall into no more weakness that night. But Kate had</p>
<p class="p1">unconsciously betrayed her secret to the officer. And by the</p>
<p class="p1">interference of her good angel, this knowledge thus obtained, enabled</p>
<p class="p1">Colonel Conyers to do Kate a service of vital importance in after years.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Archer is come,” said Mrs. Clifton, as Catherine took her seat.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“I know it. I met him,” replied Catherine, and both fell into silence,</p>
<p class="p1">for at that instant Major Clifton and the beautiful Georgia passed them.</p>
<p class="p1">And from that time, and so long as they sat there, again and again in</p>
<p class="p1">the slow revolving of the great circle of promenaders, the pair passed</p>
<p class="p1">and repassed them—Georgia smiling, cooing, murmuring, in her low,</p>
<p class="p1">alluring music—and Archer Clifton, bending over her with his brilliant</p>
<p class="p1">gray eyes, feeding on her lovely face, seeming to sink deeper and deeper</p>
<p class="p1">into the bathos of her charms, while Carolyn turned sick with jealousy,</p>
<p class="p1">and Catherine faint with dread, and the correspondent of the</p>
<p class="p1">Fiddle-de-dee made a note of the distinguished favor with which the most</p>
<p class="p1">beautiful Mrs. C——, the reigning belle of Richmond, received the devoirs</p>
<p class="p1">of her distant relative, the celebrated Major C——. Fear nothing,</p>
<p class="p1">Carolyn, or Catherine, Archer Clifton is not in love with his uncle’s</p>
<p class="p1">widow—that very relationship would repel the idea, if nothing else. But</p>
<p class="p1">he is not indifferent to the honor of monopolizing the reigning queen of</p>
<p class="p1">the ton.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Aunt Cabell,” said Carolyn, “I cannot sit up longer. I _must_ go home.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">And Mrs. Cabell consented to gratify her wish. In fact it was growing</p>
<p class="p1">late, and the ultra fashionables, the last to come, and the first to</p>
<p class="p1">leave, were beginning to disappear. Mrs. Georgia unwillingly discovered</p>
<p class="p1">this fact, but she thought that at least she could adroitly secure the</p>
<p class="p1">services of her companion as an escort home, and detain him to any hour</p>
<p class="p1">in the little paradise of her own boudoir. She therefore expressed</p>
<p class="p1">herself ennuied, and entreated Major Clifton to conduct her to the</p>
<p class="p1">cloak-room. He attended her thither. And there he met again his Cousin</p>
<p class="p1">Carolyn. She looked so fair, so wan, so fragile, that he could not for a</p>
<p class="p1">moment take his eyes from her. He hastily adjusted the mantle over the</p>
<p class="p1">shoulders of Georgia, handed her her muff and hood, and excusing himself</p>
<p class="p1">for a moment, hurried back to his mother’s side.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“You have company home, madam, have you not?”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Certainly, Archer. I should not be here without such a provision—here</p>
<p class="p1">comes Colonel Conyers now to attend us.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Good-night, then! I will see you early to-morrow! Good-night, Kate!” He</p>
<p class="p1">was off.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Mrs. Cabell and Carolyn, leaning on Major Cabell’s arms, reached their</p>
<p class="p1">carriage door. The Major dropped his cousin’s arm a moment to assist his</p>
<p class="p1">mother in, and to settle her in her seat. And during that moment Carolyn</p>
<p class="p1">felt an arm passed around her waist, and a voice whisper—</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Carolyn—my beloved cousin! my bride! am I forgiven?”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">She burst into tears and dropped her proud head on his bosom,</p>
<p class="p1">exclaiming—</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Oh, Archer! am _I_ forgiven?”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">He placed her in the carriage, and springing in past Major Cabell, took</p>
<p class="p1">the seat by her side, leaving the Major to follow as he could, and</p>
<p class="p1">forgetting the very existence of Mrs. Georgia.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Kate was close to them—she saw and heard it all. Nodding her head slowly</p>
<p class="p1">several times, she murmured—</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Thank God. Thank God! Oh, Merciful Father, help me to say that</p>
<p class="p1">sincerely. Thank God!”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Three weeks after this they were married. The ceremony was performed in</p>
<p class="p1">the ancient church of St. John’s on Richmond Hill—one of the oldest</p>
<p class="p1">places of worship on the whole continent. Mrs. Cabell would willingly</p>
<p class="p1">have made this event the occasion of a great deal of ostentatious</p>
<p class="p1">display; but the recent afflictions in the family, and the fragility of</p>
<p class="p1">the bride, rendered other arrangements necessary. Therefore, immediately</p>
<p class="p1">after the ceremony, which came off at an early hour of the morning, the</p>
<p class="p1">newly-married couple, taking advantage of the very fine weather,</p>
<p class="p1">departed for Norfolk, with the intention of sailing thence to Havana,</p>
<p class="p1">where, by the advice of an eminent physician, for the re-establishment</p>
<p class="p1">of the bride’s health, they purposed to spend the winter.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Mrs. Georgia Clifton, with all the other members of the family</p>
<p class="p1">connection, had, of course, been present at the marriage. And no one was</p>
<p class="p1">so lavish of smiles, tears, caresses, and congratulations, as the</p>
<p class="p1">dark-eyed syren. But when all was over, and the bridal pair had</p>
<p class="p1">departed, refusing the invitation of Mrs. Cabell to go home and dine</p>
<p class="p1">with a party of friends, she hurried to her lodgings, pushed open the</p>
<p class="p1">door of her luxurious boudoir, fastened it on the inside, and threw</p>
<p class="p1">herself down, rolling over, tearing at the carpet, and gnashing her</p>
<p class="p1">teeth in an agony of disappointment, jealousy and impotent rage.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">But not long did the Circe of Richmond yield herself up to anguish and</p>
<p class="p1">despair. Christmas was approaching, when she was expected to entertain a</p>
<p class="p1">select number of her worshipers at White Cliffs. It was expedient that</p>
<p class="p1">she should go down a few days in advance of the party, to make ready for</p>
<p class="p1">their reception. Therefore, about five days after the marriage, she left</p>
<p class="p1">the city.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Mrs. Clifton remained a week longer in town, to give Catherine an</p>
<p class="p1">opportunity of attending a course of lectures on Moral Philosophy. And</p>
<p class="p1">their escort every evening was Colonel Conyers.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>

<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">It was always Mrs. Clifton’s rule to spend Christmas at home—so she</p>
<p class="p1">arranged to leave Richmond on the twenty-third. It was three o’clock on</p>
<p class="p1">the dark, cold, winter morning, that the stage called for them. Our</p>
<p class="p1">travelers were muffled up to the ears in hoods, cloaks, shawls and furs,</p>
<p class="p1">and when they entered the coach, they seemed to fill up all the back. It</p>
<p class="p1">was so dark that they could see nothing, and the stage seemed to be</p>
<p class="p1">vacant of other passengers than themselves; until Mrs. Clifton, settling</p>
<p class="p1">her own outer garments, spoke, cautioning Catherine to fold her cloak</p>
<p class="p1">carefully about her. Then another voice spoke, from the opposite seat,</p>
<p class="p1">exclaiming, in a tone of surprise and pleasure—</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Why, is it possible! Mrs. Clifton and Miss Kavanagh?”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Yes, Colonel Conyers, and I am as much pleased as surprised to find you</p>
<p class="p1">here! How comes it that we are fellow travelers?” said the lady, placing</p>
<p class="p1">her own in his offered hand.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“And how-do-you-do, Miss Kavanagh?—really, I am so overjoyed to find you</p>
<p class="p1">here! Why, you must know, my dear Mrs. Clifton, that I have been due at</p>
<p class="p1">White Cliffs for several days. I am, in fact, the laggard of a party—but</p>
<p class="p1">in truth I could not tear myself from Richmond, while you and Miss</p>
<p class="p1">Kavanagh remained. But last night, after taking leave of you, as I</p>
<p class="p1">supposed, for some length of time,—under great depression of spirits,</p>
<p class="p1">Miss Kavanagh,—I sent and had a place taken in this stage, for L——,</p>
<p class="p1">which I understand to be the nearest stage station to White Cliffs. Why,</p>
<p class="p1">how little did I suspect that we were to travel by the same coach!</p>
<p class="p1">Truly, ‘life is full of paper walls.’ A word dropped by either of us,</p>
<p class="p1">last night, would have revealed the fact to the other! But how delighted</p>
<p class="p1">I am, Miss Kavanagh! And may I hope, Mrs. Clifton, that our journey lies</p>
<p class="p1">for some distance together?”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“For the whole distance, I am happy to say. The plantation of White</p>
<p class="p1">Cliffs and the farm of Hardbargain join. Our journey terminates at L——.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Really! Why this is excellent! So, instead of being separated, we shall</p>
<p class="p1">travel all the way together, and then continue to be neighbors for some</p>
<p class="p1">weeks! Miss Kavanagh, I am overjoyed.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">There was not much traveling at that season of the year, so our party of</p>
<p class="p1">three had the coach to themselves, and Colonel Conyers devoted himself</p>
<p class="p1">with great assiduity to the comfort of the ladies.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">At the end of the second day, just as the level beams of the setting sun</p>
<p class="p1">were gilding all the village windows, the stage rolled into L——.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">There, before the little tavern door, waited Mrs. Clifton’s</p>
<p class="p1">old-fashioned carriage.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Did you notify the family of White Cliffs of your intended arrival here</p>
<p class="p1">to-day?” asked Mrs. Clifton, of Colonel Conyers.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“No, madam! My journey was resolved upon so suddenly—out of ‘my grief</p>
<p class="p1">and my impatience’ at the supposed loss of your own and Miss Kavanagh’s</p>
<p class="p1">society—that I had no time to write.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Ah! that is the reason why their carriage is not waiting for you.</p>
<p class="p1">Colonel Conyers, if you will take a seat with us to Hardbargain, and</p>
<p class="p1">rest for a few hours or a few days as you please, we shall be very glad,</p>
<p class="p1">and we shall furnish you with a conveyance to White Cliffs whenever you</p>
<p class="p1">wish to go.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Colonel Conyers expressed himself but too happy to accept Mrs. Clifton’s</p>
<p class="p1">invitation, and they all entered the old-fashioned carriage, and set out</p>
<p class="p1">for Hardbargain. The farm was nine miles distant, and the road the very</p>
<p class="p1">roughest, even of mountain turnpikes. Colonel Conyers ventured to wonder</p>
<p class="p1">how any carriage could stand it, and surmised that R—— County must be</p>
<p class="p1">blessed with the best wheelwrights in the world—to which Mrs. Clifton</p>
<p class="p1">replied that they _had_ the very best to be met with anywhere.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">It was ten o’clock at night when they reached Hardbargain, but they</p>
<p class="p1">found the hall lighted up, fires blazing in the parlor, and the</p>
<p class="p1">dining-room, and a substantial supper waiting for the order of the</p>
<p class="p1">mistress. The farm-house looked cheerful, hospitable, and inviting; and</p>
<p class="p1">Colonel Conyers rubbed his hands in delight. He remained over night. The</p>
<p class="p1">next day was Christmas, and nothing but the binding engagement to render</p>
<p class="p1">an account of himself to the beautiful Georgia at least by Christmas,</p>
<p class="p1">could have forced him to White Cliffs that day. He accepted Mrs.</p>
<p class="p1">Clifton’s cordial invitation to come over often while he remained in the</p>
<p class="p1">neighborhood. In fact, Mrs. Clifton had seen that Colonel Conyers was</p>
<p class="p1">very much pleased with Catherine, and felt desirous that he should have</p>
<p class="p1">an opportunity of winning the affections of her favorite. Colonel</p>
<p class="p1">Conyers took the largest advantage of Mrs. Clifton’s hospitality, and</p>
<p class="p1">not even the charms of the syren of White Cliffs, could wile him away</p>
<p class="p1">from his daily evening ride over to Hardbargain. And so, after a few</p>
<p class="p1">weeks—as there is no accounting for tastes, and as the most</p>
<p class="p1">extraordinary things sometimes really do happen—it turned out that</p>
<p class="p1">Colonel Conyers actually did lay his heart, hand and fortune at the feet</p>
<p class="p1">of the humble girl whom his own subordinate officer, Captain Clifton,</p>
<p class="p1">had despised, and, farthermore, that he was rejected by her! Yes!</p>
<p class="p1">gratefully, kindly, but firmly and finally rejected! And full of</p>
<p class="p1">disappointment, humiliation and sorrow, the gallant Colonel abruptly</p>
<p class="p1">concluded his visit, and returned to town.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Oh, Catherine, my dear, if you could but have liked him well enough to</p>
<p class="p1">have married him. He is an honest, kind-hearted man,” said Mrs. Clifton,</p>
<p class="p1">with a sigh of regret.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Yes, he is a good man. Heaven bless him with a good wife,” answered</p>
<p class="p1">Kate.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Neither of these unworldly women once reverted to the advantages of rank</p>
<p class="p1">resigned with the rejected lover.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">And soon Catherine had other thoughts and occupations than those</p>
<p class="p1">connected with courtship and marriage. The situation of her grandfather</p>
<p class="p1">demanded all her care. For many months before this, the long and</p>
<p class="p1">persevering efforts of the patient girl had been blessed with success,</p>
<p class="p1">and the old man had abandoned the use of intoxicating spirits. But</p>
<p class="p1">within the last few weeks the total disuse of the stimulant to which he</p>
<p class="p1">was morbidly accustomed, had began to produce the most dangerous effects</p>
<p class="p1">upon his aged and infirm frame. He grew weaker and still weaker, until</p>
<p class="p1">at length he was confined to his bed. And so he slowly sank and failed</p>
<p class="p1">as weeks—weary weeks—dragged on to months. And through all this dreary</p>
<p class="p1">time, day and night, Catherine faithfully nursed him. Many a night she</p>
<p class="p1">sat the only watcher by his bedside, hourly expecting his death; and</p>
<p class="p1">many a morning he revived again, so deep a hold had life upon that old,</p>
<p class="p1">worn body. Scarcely for necessary food or rest would Catherine leave</p>
<p class="p1">him, always watching, waiting on and cheering him, sometimes—whenever he</p>
<p class="p1">desired it—reading the Bible to him, singing or praying with him. In</p>
<p class="p1">vain Mrs. Clifton noticing the care-worn, toil-worn, emaciated</p>
<p class="p1">countenance of the girl, besought her to take care of her own health.</p>
<p class="p1">Catherine cared for nothing on earth so much as the aged man daily</p>
<p class="p1">fading away from her sight. And so passed the winter. And so opened the</p>
<p class="p1">spring. And then his old disease, if it could be called a disease, took</p>
<p class="p1">a most alarming turn. After a paroxysm more violent than ever had come</p>
<p class="p1">on him before, he fell into a state of greater prostration. And the</p>
<p class="p1">physician hastily summoned, declared that another such attack would be</p>
<p class="p1">fatal, and that only the use of brandy could ward the fit off, and save</p>
<p class="p1">his life. Carl Wetzel replied that he felt if he should taste the</p>
<p class="p1">intoxicating liquid again, the fatal appetite for alcohol would return</p>
<p class="p1">upon him with tenfold violence for the temporary abstinence, and that it</p>
<p class="p1">would totally subject him to its dominion. The doctor called him a fool</p>
<p class="p1">and a fanatic, without self-control or self-reliance, and left him to</p>
<p class="p1">his fate. When the physician had left the hut, the old man called his</p>
<p class="p1">grand-daughter to his bedside.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Kate, you heard what the doctor said?”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Kate nodded—her heart was too full for speech.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“My dear child—my dear, good Kate!—he says that unless I drink brandy I</p>
<p class="p1">shall die. But, Kate, if I taste brandy again, I feel I shall live—a</p>
<p class="p1">drunkard! Kate, I know you are wise and good beyond your years. Kate, I</p>
<p class="p1">have full faith in you! My child, I will do as you decide for me.</p>
<p class="p1">Darling, shall I drink or die?”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Kate sank upon her knees by his bedside, took both his venerable hands</p>
<p class="p1">and kissed and pressed them to her bosom, bowed her face over them, and</p>
<p class="p1">wept in silence. At last, raising her head, she gazed earnestly,</p>
<p class="p1">reverently, lovingly in the old man’s face, and answered—</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Dearest grandfather, do not ask me, a poor, weak, erring girl! Dearest</p>
<p class="p1">grandfather, ask God!”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">The old man feebly raised his hand, and placed it on her head and</p>
<p class="p1">blessed her, adding—</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“I thank Thee, oh, Father! that out of the mouths of babes and sucklings</p>
<p class="p1">Thou hast perfected praise!”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">The next morning, when the doctor came, he found the old man sinking</p>
<p class="p1">fast, yet clinging as human nature will cling, to the wish for—the hope</p>
<p class="p1">of—life.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Doctor, is there no other way of saving me than that you spoke of?”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“None, whatever, my good friend; unless you consent to save yourself by</p>
<p class="p1">taking alcohol, you must die.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Then I will die[1]!” replied Carl Wetzel.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Footnote 1:</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>A Fact</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">And within a week from this time the old man died and was buried.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">After the funeral was over, Mrs. Clifton invited and urged Catherine to</p>
<p class="p1">come and take up her permanent residence at Hardbargain. There were now</p>
<p class="p1">no reasons why Catherine should not, and many why she should, accept</p>
<p class="p1">this very advantageous offer.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Her brother Carl was about to bring home a wife, after which he would no</p>
<p class="p1">longer need Catherine’s services. And now that the spring had fully</p>
<p class="p1">opened, Mrs. Clifton’s health, as usual at that season, failed, and she</p>
<p class="p1">really needed the companionship and care of our unprofessed Sister of</p>
<p class="p1">Charity. And, therefore, Catherine accepted her proposal, and came to</p>
<p class="p1">take possession of the room, Mrs. Clifton had fitted up for her</p>
<p class="p1">adjoining her own chamber. It had once been Archer Clifton’s room. That</p>
<p class="p1">was of no consequence to Catherine now, however. You need not now be</p>
<p class="p1">told again that the girl was a true Christian. She had great faith—she</p>
<p class="p1">believed in miracles, asserting that the days of miracles had not</p>
<p class="p1">passed—could not pass until the days of God’s Omnipotence and man’s</p>
<p class="p1">faith should be passed. When the passion of her heart was about to</p>
<p class="p1">become the sin of her soul, she prayed to God to remove the last vestige</p>
<p class="p1">of that erring, ill-fated love—and it was removed—gone! She could think</p>
<p class="p1">of him, speak of him, without an altered pulse. She knew that he and his</p>
<p class="p1">wife were soon expected at White Cliffs, and she felt that she would</p>
<p class="p1">meet them again without any other emotion than pleasure. On the day of</p>
<p class="p1">her removal to Hardbargain, Mrs. Clifton said to her—</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Catherine! I see by the Richmond Standard, that Archer has resigned his</p>
<p class="p1">post in the army.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“It is not possible, madam!”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Yes, indeed. I was very much astonished to see it.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“What in the world could have been his motive?”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“I cannot even form an idea. No motive was assigned in the paper.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“And did he never mention his intention to you in any of his letters?”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Never, Kate. But indeed, I have not heard from him for six weeks. I</p>
<p class="p1">cannot tell the reason why he does not write. Perhaps his letters have</p>
<p class="p1">been lost—the foreign mails are so irregular.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Was he at Havana when you heard from him last, madam?”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Yes, Catherine—but then he spoke of a speedy return home. They should</p>
<p class="p1">have been here long before this time, or at least, he should have</p>
<p class="p1">written to account for their delay. I send Henny regularly to the</p>
<p class="p1">post-office—I have sent her to-day. I hope I may get a letter, though</p>
<p class="p1">the chances seem to diminish.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Even while they spoke, the girl came in with a letter in her hand. Mrs.</p>
<p class="p1">Clifton took it and looked at it, saying—</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“At last! It is from Havana, Catherine, from Archer.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">She opened it, and as she read it, her face became very grave. And</p>
<p class="p1">having finished, she fell into thought, and said—</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“It is as I feared.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“I trust there is no bad news, madam?” said Catherine.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“You shall hear, Kate,” replied the lady, taking up the letter and</p>

<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“MY DEAR MADAM—</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“I have to entreat your forgiveness for a silence of four or five</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>weeks. I know that you will pardon the seeming neglect when you are</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>advised of the cause. Every moment of my time for the last month has</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>been taken up in attendance upon the sick couch of my dearest Carolyn.</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Since the opening of the spring, her health, for the last year so</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>fragile, has fearfully failed. I have had the best medical advice to</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>be found on the island, but her illness has baffled their utmost</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>skill. They have recommended me to take her to the South of France. In</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>order to do this, I have been obliged to resign my commission in the</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>army. You have doubtless seen my resignation announced in the papers.</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I suppose the unsettled business of the White Cliffs estate must also</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>suffer by my absence at this time. But what is that—what is anything!</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>all things! in comparison to the health of my beloved Carolyn! I write</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>in great haste, on the very eve of sailing, for we go on board the</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Swallow, bound from this port to Marseilles, to-day.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“With undying respect and affection,</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">                                                       </span>“ARCHER CLIFTON.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“That is very distressing! Alas! then is life made up of nothing but</p>
<p class="p1">vain desires and blighted hopes—of sorrow and sickness and death?”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“I knew it would be so, Catherine—that was a secret reason I had for not</p>
<p class="p1">meddling this last time in bringing about a reconciliation between</p>
<p class="p1">Carolyn and Archer. I have known for two years past that she was</p>
<p class="p1">following her mother. All those Gowers die early of consumption.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“But, madam, let us hope better things. This sea voyage and residence in</p>
<p class="p1">the South of France, may restore her.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Never, Catherine. And it was even cruel in the doctors to send her</p>
<p class="p1">there, to die in a foreign land, among strangers. They had better have</p>
<p class="p1">sent her home to the scenes of her childhood and youth, where we could</p>
<p class="p1">have cheered and nursed her. Catherine, I feel very sad.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">The tears were rolling down Kate’s face. The fountain of consolation in</p>
<p class="p1">her heart was almost dry—and again she had to lift her heart to the</p>
<p class="p1">Divine source of all strength and light for new faith and hope. Little</p>
<p class="p1">else but suffering and sorrow had the girl seen since she came into the</p>
<p class="p1">world—and no part had she filled in life but that of servant, nurse, or</p>
<p class="p1">comforter.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">The summer passed with Mrs. Clifton and Catherine in almost</p>
<p class="p1">uninterrupted retirement. They heard, at long intervals, from Major</p>
<p class="p1">Clifton and his bride, and then the news was various and unsatisfactory.</p>
<p class="p1">Sometimes Carolyn was better, and there would be a talk of speedy</p>
<p class="p1">return, and, perhaps, the very next letter, after a long interval, would</p>
<p class="p1">speak of a season of prostration by extreme illness. And about the</p>
<p class="p1">middle of the autumn, Mrs. Clifton received a letter from her son</p>
<p class="p1">announcing their intention of wintering in Lisbon. The irregular</p>
<p class="p1">arrivals of these bulletins were the most interesting, and nearly the</p>
<p class="p1">_only_ interesting events of the summer and autumn, if we except a</p>
<p class="p1">descent upon White Cliffs by Mrs. Georgia and her friends. The syren,</p>
<p class="p1">after her return from a summer tour to the fashionable watering places,</p>
<p class="p1">determined to fill up the dull interim before the commencement of the</p>
<p class="p1">season in town, by a visit to her “seat in R——,” as she persisted in</p>
<p class="p1">calling White Cliffs. Accordingly, she made up a party of idle ladies</p>
<p class="p1">and sporting gentlemen, and came down to spend September.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Colonel Conyers was among the guests. He renewed his visits to</p>
<p class="p1">Hardbargain, and his suit to Catherine—received a second rejection, and</p>
<p class="p1">hurried off to town, under the sting of mortification as before. At the</p>
<p class="p1">first of October, the “city riff raff,” as the old family servants of</p>
<p class="p1">Clifton irreverently and indignantly called the moneyed aristocrats,</p>
<p class="p1">returned to Richmond, whither they were shortly followed by their</p>
<p class="p1">beautiful hostess, to prepare for her winter campaign. From this time to</p>
<p class="p1">the middle of December, no event marked the even tenor of the life at</p>
<p class="p1">Hardbargain. The inmates had not lately heard from Major Clifton. It was</p>
<p class="p1">near Christmas. In her anxiety to hear from Lisbon, Mrs. Clifton was in</p>
<p class="p1">the habit of sending to L—— twice a week, when the mail came in, and</p>
<p class="p1">sitting up till a very late hour, waiting for the return of the</p>
<p class="p1">messenger.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">One evening after supper, Mrs. Clifton and Catherine sat each side their</p>
<p class="p1">work-stand, before the fire, awaiting the arrival of the boy who had</p>
<p class="p1">been dispatched to the post-office. So often had the lady thus sat and</p>
<p class="p1">waited, and been disappointed, that hope waxed very faint. This time,</p>
<p class="p1">however, she was destined to have her heart gladdened by the full</p>
<p class="p1">fruition of hope. About nine o’clock the messenger returned and entered</p>
<p class="p1">the parlor with a packet of letters and papers. The boy’s face was</p>
<p class="p1">lighted up with sympathetic joy, and he exclaimed, as he handed the</p>
<p class="p1">bundle—</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“I almos’ rid myself to death, mist’ess, I was so glad I had de letters</p>
<p class="p1">to bring yer.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“You have made great haste indeed, Neddy. Go tell Henny to give you your</p>
<p class="p1">supper,” said the lady.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Good boy,” said Kate, pressing his little sooty hand as he passed her</p>
<p class="p1">and went out.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Mrs. Clifton was reading a letter from Archer. It was written in a glad,</p>
<p class="p1">buoyant spirit and contained the best possible news. Against all hope,</p>
<p class="p1">Carolyn’s health since her arrival at Lisbon had steadily improved, and</p>
<p class="p1">it was now so far re-established, that they were already looking forward</p>
<p class="p1">to their voyage at the earliest opening of spring. Carolyn had gained</p>
<p class="p1">flesh and color as well as health, and strength and cheerfulness, and</p>
<p class="p1">was looking far better than she had looked since his first meeting her</p>
<p class="p1">again at Richmond. Mrs. Clifton repeated all this to Catherine, adding—</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“It is true, Kate, that none of her family who have perished by her</p>
<p class="p1">disease ever tried a change of climate, and although in most cases such</p>
<p class="p1">a change hurries the patient to the grave, yet, in some instances, it</p>
<p class="p1">seems to work wonders in the way of cure; and who knows, if Carolyn is</p>
<p class="p1">so greatly benefited, that she may not get over this danger, and if not</p>
<p class="p1">positively cured, yet live to a good old age, and die at last of</p>
<p class="p1">something else, as I have heard of consumptives doing.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“I’m so glad!” Catherine sat with her face suffused with the flush, and</p>
<p class="p1">her eyes filled with the tears of sympathizing joy and thanksgiving.</p>
<p class="p1">After reading and re-reading the letter, and dwelling on it, and talking</p>
<p class="p1">of it, Mrs. Clifton finally unfolded the paper, the Richmond Standard,</p>
<p class="p1">and running her eyes over its columns, suddenly exclaimed—</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Catherine, ‘When joys come they come not as single spies but in</p>
<p class="p1">battalions’—here is excellent news of an old friend—listen—only two or</p>
<p class="p1">three lines among the ‘items’ of a newspaper column, yet of what great</p>
<p class="p1">moment to many—hear.” And the lady read:—“At the conclusion of the</p>
<p class="p1">recent treaty of peace between this government and the Shoshonowa</p>
<p class="p1">Nation, among the prisoners held to ransom was the gallant Captain</p>
<p class="p1">Fairfax, supposed to have fallen under their tomahawks, at the massacre</p>
<p class="p1">near Fort Protection. This brave but unfortunate officer is now</p>
<p class="p1">understood to be on his way to the seat of government.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Catherine was positively speechless with joy; only her clasped hands and</p>
<p class="p1">fervent countenance revealed what she felt. In the great, though calm</p>
<p class="p1">surprise and rejoicings over the event, these friends forgot its</p>
<p class="p1">singularity, until after a long while Catherine exclaimed—</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Poor Zuleime! Oh, how _could_ such a fatal misrepresentation have been</p>
<p class="p1">made of the case? It was reported that he was cloven down from his</p>
<p class="p1">saddle, and then butchered!”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“It was not a willful misrepresentation. It was a misapprehension. The</p>
<p class="p1">few who escaped to tell the tale of the massacre, no doubt had seen him</p>
<p class="p1">struck down; and don’t you see in the terror and confusion, they</p>
<p class="p1">imagined the rest—knowing perfectly well that scalping and rifling the</p>
<p class="p1">bodies are the almost invariable custom of the savages? And then</p>
<p class="p1">remember, Catherine, the body taken for the corpse of Captain Fairfax,</p>
<p class="p1">was so rifled and mutilated, as to be unrecognizable, except upon</p>
<p class="p1">circumstantial evidence.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“So indeed it was said to be! I would the mistake had never been made</p>
<p class="p1">though! It killed Zuleime!”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Catherine, my child, I have no idea that Zuleime was really drowned.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Madam!”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Do you not know, Catherine, that any body drowned in that part of the</p>
<p class="p1">river where the supposed signs of her suicide were found, must have come</p>
<p class="p1">to light. Don’t you know that the current is very rapid there, and that</p>
<p class="p1">a ledge of rocks crosses the river a few yards below it, upon which her</p>
<p class="p1">body must have been thrown, if she had been in the river at all? And,</p>
<p class="p1">Catherine, if I have never breathed this thought before, it was upon</p>
<p class="p1">account of poor Carolyn. I knew that in her weak, depressed state of</p>
<p class="p1">mind and body, she could better bear the belief of Zuleime’s death, than</p>
<p class="p1">the frightful uncertainty of her fate. You are discreet, Kate; you will</p>
<p class="p1">not breathe this to Carolyn, or to any one, lest it should reach her</p>
<p class="p1">ear.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Never! And do you know, dear Mrs. Clifton, I have sometimes had the</p>
<p class="p1">thought that Zuleime might yet be living—and I dared not indulge the</p>
<p class="p1">hope secretly—much less breathe it aloud.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“And what was _your_ reason for such a supposition, Catherine?”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Why my thought was not so well founded—so logical as yours. I knew</p>
<p class="p1">nothing about the peculiarities of the river. My thought was only a</p>
<p class="p1">vague hope, and it agitated me so much as to interfere with my practical</p>
<p class="p1">duties. I had to banish it.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“You are so sensitive, so sympathetic, my dear girl. Well, Kate, no more</p>
<p class="p1">exciting talk to-night. We will return thanks to God for these glad</p>
<p class="p1">tidings, and then retire to rest.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">                             </span>CHAPTER XXIII.</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">                                </span>ZULEIME.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">            </span>Among a jumbled heap of murky buildings.—KEATS.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Zuleime had been placed by Georgia under the care of a poor woman, the</p>
<p class="p1">wife of a carver and gilder, who had occasionally worked for her father.</p>
<p class="p1">And as long as the funds of the belle had held out, the trifling</p>
<p class="p1">expenses of such poor board and lodging had been regularly paid. But</p>
<p class="p1">when the syren was reduced to support her own extravagance entirely by</p>
<p class="p1">credit, founded upon the false reputation of wealth—her small</p>
<p class="p1">remittances to her protégé, or rather her victim, ceased. Zuleime was</p>
<p class="p1">afraid to seek her, afraid to write to her—there was nothing she feared</p>
<p class="p1">more than discovery, and the recognition of her hand-writing on the</p>
<p class="p1">superscription of a letter might have led to that. It was long after the</p>
<p class="p1">death of her father before she heard of it—nor then did she hear any of</p>
<p class="p1">the particulars of time, place or circumstance. The fact came to her</p>
<p class="p1">knowledge irregularly, through the report of the transcendant charms and</p>
<p class="p1">conquests of his beautiful young widow. A long and dangerous illness was</p>
<p class="p1">the result of this sudden news. It was some weeks after her recovery</p>
<p class="p1">before the poor people of the house, who had long despaired of getting</p>
<p class="p1">anything for her board, could find it in their kind hearts to ask her to</p>
<p class="p1">seek another home. And even then they sent a sigh after the desolate</p>
<p class="p1">young widow—the child who went forth carrying in her arms another child.</p>
<p class="p1">And how she lived during the interval between that and the period at</p>
<p class="p1">which I shall again introduce her to you, I cannot tell. Sometimes a</p>
<p class="p1">little fine needle-work came to her hands; sometimes a spell of want,</p>
<p class="p1">reaching almost to starvation; then a little assistance from neighbors;</p>
<p class="p1">and a little going in debt to shopkeepers. And then she always lodged</p>
<p class="p1">with the poor. And the poor seldom persecute the poor; remember that the</p>
<p class="p1">needy family who first sheltered her, had been for months at the sole</p>
<p class="p1">expense of her food, lodging, and long illness—and yet they had never</p>
<p class="p1">reproached or persecuted her for unpaid debts—though they scarcely</p>
<p class="p1">refrained from reproaching themselves for sending her away.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">In a quiet, back street, mostly inhabited by very humble people, in the</p>
<p class="p1">middle of the square, and fronting immediately upon the battered</p>
<p class="p1">pavement, stood an old two-story brick house, occupied by a poor</p>
<p class="p1">cabinet-maker and old furniture dealer. The lower front room was used as</p>
<p class="p1">the ware-room, and crowded and piled up with every description of</p>
<p class="p1">miserably dilapidated household furniture, apparently good for nothing</p>
<p class="p1">else under the sun but kindling wood, and scarcely worth splitting up</p>
<p class="p1">for that. Old worm-eaten, carved mahogany bureaus and bedsteads; tables</p>
<p class="p1">without legs or leaves; chairs without backs; cradles without bottoms or</p>
<p class="p1">rockers; clocks wanting faces; beaufets wanting doors; sofas minus arms;</p>
<p class="p1">smoky pictures without frames; and tarnished frames without pictures;</p>
<p class="p1">worm-eaten cabinets, and mildewed looking-glasses; broken pots, pans and</p>
<p class="p1">kettles; and mismatched crockery-ware in any quantity.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Reader, I do not wish to give you an inventory of an old furniture-shop,</p>
<p class="p1">but merely some idea of the inextricable confusion in which this</p>
<p class="p1">heterogeneous mass of worn out, broken, worm-eaten, mildewed,</p>
<p class="p1">fly-stained, dust-clothed, cobweb-veiled items, were piled up from floor</p>
<p class="p1">to ceiling. It would make your heart and head ache with wondering what</p>
<p class="p1">sort of a living could be picked out from so much dirt, disorder and</p>
<p class="p1">decay—and who on earth could be the patrons of the establishment. You</p>
<p class="p1">would unconsciously gather close about you your most worthless dress in</p>
<p class="p1">passing through the shop, and look up in involuntary dread of a broken</p>
<p class="p1">head or limbs, by the fall of some of those dilapidated, ill-balanced,</p>
<p class="p1">old chairs and tables.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">The family of the chair-maker consisted of himself, his wife, and two</p>
<p class="p1">daughters. They were Germans, with the usual talent of that race for</p>
<p class="p1">money-getting and money-keeping. And the man made at least a hundred per</p>
<p class="p1">cent. on every old, rickety, worm-eaten bureau or table that, mended and</p>
<p class="p1">varnished, left his shop. They added to their income, by letting the</p>
<p class="p1">rooms of their house, and occasionally by taking a profitable boarder.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">It was in the early part of the same autumn which found her sister</p>
<p class="p1">Carolyn in Lisbon—and Mrs. Clifton and Catherine alone at Hardbargain,</p>
<p class="p1">that Zuleime became a tenant of the German cabinet-maker. She occupied</p>
<p class="p1">the back room, on the second floor; the two daughters of the family</p>
<p class="p1">using the front room as a sleeping apartment. She had the use of the</p>
<p class="p1">street passage door, and so reached her room without passing through the</p>
<p class="p1">shop or any part of the house occupied by the family or their boarders.</p>
<p class="p1">The refinement in which she had been born and bred, was not lost amid</p>
<p class="p1">her bitter poverty. It constrained her to seek privacy of life at least.</p>
<p class="p1">She supported herself and child, just now, by doing fine needle-work for</p>
<p class="p1">some ladies on a transient visit to the city. But the work was</p>
<p class="p1">precarious, and the supply might be cut off at any moment. Her expenses</p>
<p class="p1">were small, however, and her economy wonderful. Her neat, but poorly</p>
<p class="p1">furnished room, cost her but ten shillings a month; a bushel of meal and</p>
<p class="p1">a pint of salt, five shillings; milk for the child, two shillings; fuel,</p>
<p class="p1">eight shillings; washing, three shillings; candle-light, two shillings;</p>
<p class="p1">and the attendance of a boy to bring water and cut wood, three</p>
<p class="p1">shillings—making the sum total of her monthly expenses only one pound,</p>
<p class="p1">fourteen shillings, or little more than six dollars. Her only food was</p>
<p class="p1">mush or corn-cakes prepared from the meal. She could not have kept up</p>
<p class="p1">very long under this regimen; indeed, although she knew it not, she was</p>
<p class="p1">slowly dying of a disease as common as lingering, and as universally</p>
<p class="p1">ignored as that of a broken heart—namely, innutrition or slow</p>
<p class="p1">starvation. Her German hostess, kind-hearted, notwithstanding her money</p>
<p class="p1">grasping propensities, often sent her a bowl of “noodle soup,” with a</p>
<p class="p1">little plate of “sour-krout,” and a tumbler of schnapps, or some such</p>
<p class="p1">combination of German luxuries. But Zuleime, who managed to exist upon</p>
<p class="p1">coarse food, could not endure gross food, and she would turn away from</p>
<p class="p1">such, scarcely able to conceal the sickness the very odor so appetizing</p>
<p class="p1">to a Dutch stomach, excited in hers. Still her refusal of the viands was</p>
<p class="p1">couched in words so gentle and grateful, as never to offend her</p>
<p class="p1">landlady. Some of my readers may wonder why Zuleime did not do her</p>
<p class="p1">washing, water-drawing, etc., with her own hands, and take the money</p>
<p class="p1">paid for having those things done, and buy better food? Because, for one</p>
<p class="p1">reason, she had not the requisite physical strength or skill—and</p>
<p class="p1">besides, perhaps, she shrank from the exposure necessarily incurred in</p>
<p class="p1">these labors. She had not in these two years, forgotten the delicacy and</p>
<p class="p1">refinement in which she had been nurtured. On the contrary, everything</p>
<p class="p1">in her appearance and manners, betrayed the gentle-woman. She had but</p>
<p class="p1">one dress in the world—all the others had been cut up to make clothes</p>
<p class="p1">for her little girl. Her sole gown was black bombazine, which she had</p>
<p class="p1">worn daily for nearly two years—yet so good was its original quality,</p>
<p class="p1">and so well had it been preserved, that it was now neither rusty nor</p>
<p class="p1">threadbare. It was shaken out and hung up every night, and well brushed</p>
<p class="p1">and sponged every week. This dress, with the little inside ‘kerchief of</p>
<p class="p1">linen, was always neat and lady-like. Zuleime’s fine needle-work gave</p>
<p class="p1">out—as she knew it would—and she found herself without employment, or</p>
<p class="p1">funds. It was then that Bertha and Wilhelmina Erhmientraut, the</p>
<p class="p1">daughters of her landlord, told her of a German clothier on Main street,</p>
<p class="p1">who had advertised for a number of needle-women to make vests. Zuleime</p>
<p class="p1">confessed her total ignorance of that branch of needle-work. But the</p>
<p class="p1">kind German girls promised that if she would procure the work, they</p>
<p class="p1">would give her some instructions how it should be done. Zuleime</p>
<p class="p1">gratefully accepted their offer, and prepared to set out on her long</p>
<p class="p1">walk by donning the little black bonnet and shawl, as neat and as well</p>
<p class="p1">preserved as her dress had been. She could not further tax the kindness</p>
<p class="p1">of her landlord’s family by leaving her child in their care, she had</p>
<p class="p1">been obliged to put the little one to sleep, and lock it up in her room,</p>
<p class="p1">only leaving her key with her landlady—“in case anything should happen”</p>
<p class="p1">while she was gone. It was a long, weary tramp to Main street, where the</p>
<p class="p1">clothier’s store was situated. When she entered the show-shop and made</p>
<p class="p1">her business known, she was directed into a back room, where a man,</p>
<p class="p1">behind a long table, was engaged in cutting out garments—and many</p>
<p class="p1">bundles of cut out but unmade clothes, tied around with skeins of</p>
<p class="p1">thread, lay piled up at one end. Zuleime walked up to this table. The</p>
<p class="p1">foreman, as he appeared to be, laid down his shears and looked up,</p>
<p class="p1">saying deferentially—</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“What did you wish to look at, madam? Mr. Schneider, attend this lady.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“You are in error. I do not wish to look at your wares. You advertised</p>
<p class="p1">work to give out; can I have some?”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">The tailor looked at her again. He saw, from her gentle manners and</p>
<p class="p1">appearance, that she was a lady, guessed from her dress that she was a</p>
<p class="p1">widow, and knew by her errand that she was self-dependent, unprotected;</p>
<p class="p1">so there existed no earthly reason why a coarse-minded, craven-hearted</p>
<p class="p1">man, who spent his whole days in smirking, cringing, deprecating and</p>
<p class="p1">deferring to others, should not refresh his soul by a little</p>
<p class="p1">impertinence and insolence to so safe a subject as a _poor lady_.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“And you ever make vests?” he asked, in a short, curt, insolent manner.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“No,” answered Zuleime, “but I sew very neatly—unusually neatly, my</p>
<p class="p1">patrons say—and as you cut and baste the work, very little instruction</p>
<p class="p1">would enable me to make them very nicely.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“I shan’t trust you! I have had quite enough in my time of giving out</p>
<p class="p1">work to people who know nothing about the business.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">It was not the words so much as the insulting manner of the man that</p>
<p class="p1">shocked the gentle-hearted woman, and she turned and left the shop,</p>
<p class="p1">ready to sink, not so much under disappointment, though she knew not</p>
<p class="p1">where to turn for work or money or food—but under the deeply humiliating</p>
<p class="p1">sense of the rudeness and vulgarity to which she was forced to expose</p>
<p class="p1">herself in this bitter struggle through the world. She walked slowly,</p>
<p class="p1">thoughtfully, sadly away from the shop, till the sudden thought of her</p>
<p class="p1">child’s awakening, electrified her, and she hurried on until she reached</p>
<p class="p1">home. She obtained her key from the landlady, in the basement, and</p>
<p class="p1">entered the passage. It was then that she heard a very sweet, gentle</p>
<p class="p1">voice, apparently near her room door, saying—</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Don’t cry, baby! _poor_ baby, don’t cry! mother will come by-and-by!</p>
<p class="p1">_Dear pretty_ baby, don’t cry! I’ll bring you all my playthings, and a</p>
<p class="p1">little dog, when I can get in.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">And then, in the pause of the child’s wails and broken talk, and baby</p>
<p class="p1">plaints, she ran up stairs at once, and there, kneeling before her door,</p>
<p class="p1">and talking through the key-hole, was a sweet little dark haired girl of</p>
<p class="p1">about five years old, and dressed in deep mourning. Her hat of the</p>
<p class="p1">finest Leghorn straw, the richness of the black ribbon that bound it—the</p>
<p class="p1">fineness of the black bombazine frock and the linen cambric tucker, the</p>
<p class="p1">delicate shoes and stockings—the gentle, refined manner, all bespoke a</p>
<p class="p1">child of a different rank from those seen in that neighborhood, and</p>
<p class="p1">especially in that house. The child got up and stood aside when she saw</p>
<p class="p1">the lady come with the key to unlock the door. When Zuleime had entered</p>
<p class="p1">her room, and lifted the babe to her lap, she called the little girl up</p>
<p class="p1">to her side. She was a lovely child indeed, with fair skin and delicate</p>
<p class="p1">features—jet black hair, eyebrows and eyelashes, and large, mournful,</p>
<p class="p1">dark gray eyes.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“You are a dear little girl. What is your name? asked Zuleime, pulling</p>
<p class="p1">her around her waist caressingly.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Ida ——; see what a nice new black dress I’ve got. They gave it to me</p>
<p class="p1">when father died. Mother wears one, too. You’ve got a black dress on,</p>
<p class="p1">too! Is your father dead?”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Yes, darling,” said Zuleime, with her eyes suffused.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Don’t cry, please! Mother cries so much. I do wish she wouldn’t! Is the</p>
<p class="p1">baby’s father dead, too?”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Yes—yes, love—the baby’s father is dead, too!”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Well—_please_ don’t cry so! Mother says we have all got a father in</p>
<p class="p1">Heaven! _Oh! please_ don’t cry so! It gives me such a—such an ache in</p>
<p class="p1">the breast to see anybody cry so,” said the child, and her mournful, but</p>
<p class="p1">most beautiful eyes assumed a pleading, painful, almost _querulous_</p>
<p class="p1">look.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Who _is_ your mother, sweet Ida?” asked Zuleime, to change the subject</p>
<p class="p1">of her own and her little companion’s thoughts.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Mrs. Knight, you know, the leading lady. Did they put the baby’s father</p>
<p class="p1">in a long red box, and send him away?”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Yes, yes, Ida. Where does your mother live?”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“She lives here, in the back room, down stairs. We came to-day. She is</p>
<p class="p1">going to play to-night, and then I’ll be by myself. Did they hold the</p>
<p class="p1">baby up to kiss her father like they did me? And did he put his hand on</p>
<p class="p1">her head and call her his fawn-eyed darling? That was when he was on the</p>
<p class="p1">bed. And afterwards he went to sleep. And they said he was dead. Was</p>
<p class="p1">that the way with the baby’s father?”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“I don’t want to talk about it, dear Ida. Tell me of your mother. What</p>
<p class="p1">does she play on—the organ?”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“No! I don’t know. Yes I do, too!—the stage. Look at my nice new hat. It</p>
<p class="p1">used to have a wreath of red roses round it. But when father died,</p>
<p class="p1">mother took it off and put this black ribbon there. Mother wears roses</p>
<p class="p1">on her head, though. At night, I mean. All day long she wears black, and</p>
<p class="p1">looks so pale and weeps. But at night, she puts beautiful flowers in her</p>
<p class="p1">hair, and sometimes gold and fine feathers—and she has such sweet long</p>
<p class="p1">curls and rosy cheeks—and such beautiful dresses. And father used to</p>
<p class="p1">wear beautiful clothes at night, red and gold, and feathers. I do want</p>
<p class="p1">to see father so much. I wish they’d bring him back. Do you think it</p>
<p class="p1">will be long before I see him?” asked the child, as the large tears</p>
<p class="p1">rolled down her cheeks.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Perhaps not, my love. Is your mother an actress, then?”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Yes, that is what she is. Don’t cry, now! It gives me a pain in my</p>
<p class="p1">bosom. _Please_ don’t cry; if _you_ don’t, _I_ won’t,” said the child,</p>
<p class="p1">wiping her eyes. Then suddenly she exclaimed, “Oh! I forgot, I promised</p>
<p class="p1">to bring the baby my playthings and my curly dog”; and so saying, the</p>
<p class="p1">child ran away and scampered down stairs.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Zuleime looked in vain for her return, and finally concluded that her</p>
<p class="p1">mother had detained her. But if the child did not come, somebody else</p>
<p class="p1">did. Wilhelmina entered, and kindly inquired after her lodger’s success</p>
<p class="p1">in seeking work. When she learned her failure, she begged Zuleime not to</p>
<p class="p1">be troubled, for that there was work in the house for her if she would</p>
<p class="p1">take it. That the new boarder, Mrs. Knight, the leading lady of the</p>
<p class="p1">Richmond Theatre, wanted assistance in making up some dresses, that were</p>
<p class="p1">to be ready in a few days. That she, Wilhelmina, had recommended their</p>
<p class="p1">lodger, and if the young lady pleased, she would conduct her down and</p>
<p class="p1">introduce her to Mrs. Knight. Zuleime thanked the kind-hearted girl, and</p>
<p class="p1">prepared to accompany her—sensible amid all her other emotions of a</p>
<p class="p1">rustic’s curiosity to see a really living actress, for she had never in</p>
<p class="p1">her life seen one off the boards. She followed Wilhelmina down the</p>
<p class="p1">stairs into the passage. Near the foot of the stairs was a door leading</p>
<p class="p1">into the first floor back room. At this door Wilhelmina rapped. It was</p>
<p class="p1">opened by Ida, who, as soon as she saw Zuleime, exclaimed—</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Oh! it’s you! Come in. Mother! here is the baby’s mother!”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“It is I, Mrs. Knight, with the person I spoke of. May we come in?”</p>
<p class="p1">inquired Wilhelmina.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Assuredly. Do so,” replied the sweetest, deepest voice Zuleime thought</p>
<p class="p1">she had ever heard. And they entered the room. Wilhelmina introduced</p>
<p class="p1">Mrs. Fairfax, and withdrew. The apartment in which Zuleime found</p>
<p class="p1">herself, was the best furnished room in the house—decidedly—having a</p>
<p class="p1">good warm, hued carpet on the floor, crimson stuff curtains at the only</p>
<p class="p1">back window, a grate with a coal fire, a four-post bedstead, with</p>
<p class="p1">tester, net valance and a white counterpane, a bureau with tall</p>
<p class="p1">dressing-glass, and wash-stand, with china toilet service. But it was in</p>
<p class="p1">a state of confusion only less than that of the adjoining shop. Trunks,</p>
<p class="p1">boxes, and band boxes of all sizes, forms and colors, some corded and</p>
<p class="p1">piled up one above the other, and some open and boiling up and over with</p>
<p class="p1">all sorts of finery and tinsel, satins, silks and velvets, feathers,</p>
<p class="p1">flowers and fustian, which also trailed upon the carpet, and strewed the</p>
<p class="p1">chairs. An oil painting, in a large heavy gilt frame, leaned with its</p>
<p class="p1">face against the wall. On the bed, a black mantle and bonnet, with a</p>
<p class="p1">widow’s veil, lay side by side with a gorgeous scarlet velvet train,</p>
<p class="p1">embroidered with gold, an imitation ermine robe, a crown of gilt and</p>
<p class="p1">paste, a plume of feathers, and great bunches of sham pearls. On a low</p>
<p class="p1">trunk, in the midst of this sad chaos of poverty and glitter, mummery</p>
<p class="p1">and mourning, sat one who immediately drew and fixed Zuleime’s</p>
<p class="p1">attention. A tall, noble looking woman, of perhaps thirty years of age,</p>
<p class="p1">clothed in deep mourning, with her heavy black hair banded around her</p>
<p class="p1">forehead and temples, and shading a countenance dark and cavernous, with</p>
<p class="p1">its large hollow eyes and hollow cheeks, but majestic with power,</p>
<p class="p1">earnestness and truth, and beautiful with those grand, mournful eyes,</p>
<p class="p1">whose mesmeric spell was felt by Zuleime, on whom they were now brought</p>
<p class="p1">to bear.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Take a seat, Mrs. Fairfax. You find me here in great confusion, because</p>
<p class="p1">I have but just arrived, and have had to unpack and look over all these</p>
<p class="p1">trunks, to select and prepare no less than four costumes for the</p>
<p class="p1">evening,” said the same rich, full, deep tones, as their owner cleared a</p>
<p class="p1">chair of spangled robes and plumes, and offered it to her visitor.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Mother is going to wear _this_ dress this evening—isn’t it pretty?”</p>
<p class="p1">said Ida, climbing upon the foot of the bed.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Zuleime turned her eyes with childish interest towards the robes; and</p>
<p class="p1">Mrs. Knight, observing her look of curiosity, said—</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“They form a portion of the Queen Katherine costume. They are going to</p>
<p class="p1">bring out Henry VIII., this evening.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Zuleime glanced from the costume to the haggard, but noble looking</p>
<p class="p1">woman, and thought that she might represent the unhappy Queen very well,</p>
<p class="p1">as far as personal appearance would go, but instead of expressing this</p>
<p class="p1">opinion, she said—</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“The young German girl told me that you wanted some assistance in</p>
<p class="p1">needle-work. I shall be glad to help you.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">The dark, mournful eyes rose slowly, and grew still, looking at the</p>
<p class="p1">young widow, in whom they now began to recognize that most piteous of</p>
<p class="p1">all beings—_a reduced lady_.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Sit down—pray sit down,” she said, to Zuleime, who still remained</p>
<p class="p1">standing.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Zuleime took the vacant chair.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Would you object, Mrs. Fairfax, to sitting with me while you sew? There</p>
<p class="p1">are alterations to be made in these four Queen Katherine dresses, in</p>
<p class="p1">which you would require my advice.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Zuleime hesitated, and then answered—</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“I should not like to leave my little child alone, madam.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Let me!—let me!—let me go up and stay with the baby!” eagerly</p>
<p class="p1">interrupted Ida, jumping down from the bed, and running up and seizing</p>
<p class="p1">the hand of her mother.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">The dark eyes sank fondly on the little one, and the rich voice—richer</p>
<p class="p1">now with maternal love, replied—</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Certainly you may go, if the lady will permit you to do so.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Zuleime hesitated again, then said—</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Thank you. I shall be very glad. Let me go up first, and make the fire</p>
<p class="p1">safe.” And she left the room, followed by Ida, who ran back first, to</p>
<p class="p1">throw her arms around her mother’s neck, and kiss her “good-bye.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">When Zuleime reached her room, she placed the blower before the grate,</p>
<p class="p1">for safety—hid away all implements with which the children might harm</p>
<p class="p1">themselves, and leaving the little ones at play upon the rag carpet,</p>
<p class="p1">returned below stairs, and went to work. Her new occupation was indeed</p>
<p class="p1">of an odd and miscellaneous description—ripping off gold lace, and</p>
<p class="p1">sewing in its place imitation sable; trimming buskins, and lastly,</p>
<p class="p1">making up an ancient coiffure, all under the direction of the</p>
<p class="p1">shadowy-faced woman, who, all this time, sat upon the trunk, with a</p>
<p class="p1">tattered play-book on her knee, studying her part.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Zuleime spoke of Ida—her beauty, her charming manner.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Is she? Do you find her so? I thought that might be only my partiality.</p>
<p class="p1">Poor little one! She is a great comfort and a great sorrow to me, if you</p>
<p class="p1">can understand such a paradox.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Yes, I can understand it,” said Zuleime.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“I have to leave her all the forenoon, for the purpose of attending the</p>
<p class="p1">rehearsals, and then, before it is time for her to go to bed, I have to</p>
<p class="p1">leave her, alone, and go to the theatre, and be absent till a late hour</p>
<p class="p1">of the night. And then the fear of fire, or of accident, while I am gone</p>
<p class="p1">from her, wears me out. Worse than that, all day and night, while away</p>
<p class="p1">from her, is the dread of her getting in the street, and into evil</p>
<p class="p1">company.” And the eyes of the woman assumed an anxious, haggard,</p>
<p class="p1">querulous look, as she dropped them upon her book.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Give your little girl into my care. I am never absent from home except</p>
<p class="p1">early in the morning—as to-day—and at that hour you are here.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">The dark eyes flew up and fastened themselves upon the face of Zuleime,</p>
<p class="p1">and the deep voice inquired—</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Would you really take charge of her for me? Oh, it is too much for you,</p>
<p class="p1">and too good in you. I don’t understand it.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Indeed I shall be very glad to do so. The presence of a lovely child is</p>
<p class="p1">a great pleasure to me. Leave Ida with me this evening while you are</p>
<p class="p1">gone, and I will put her to bed when the time comes.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“For this evening I will gratefully accept your kindness, but you may</p>
<p class="p1">find her more inconvenient than you anticipate,” said Mrs. Knight. And</p>
<p class="p1">then she dropped her eyes again upon her book, and Zuleime went on</p>
<p class="p1">silently with her sewing. About sunset the work was nearly completed,</p>
<p class="p1">and the costume, with the exception of the coiffure, upon which Zuleime</p>
<p class="p1">was still engaged, was packed in bandboxes, to be conveyed to the</p>
<p class="p1">theatre. Then Mrs. Knight rang a little hand bell, and when it was</p>
<p class="p1">answered by the entrance of Bertha Erhmientraut, she said,—“Please send</p>
<p class="p1">me a lad to carry these boxes for me, and ask your mother to make me a</p>
<p class="p1">very strong cup of coffee.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Bertha disappeared, and Mrs. Knight put on her bonnet and shawl. And</p>
<p class="p1">soon a ragged boy appeared at the door, who agreed to carry the boxes</p>
<p class="p1">for a sixpence. Mrs. Knight loaded and dispatched him at the same moment</p>
<p class="p1">that Bertha re-appeared with a huge cup of strong coffee, which she took</p>
<p class="p1">and drank off, standing. Then, as she handed back the empty cup to the</p>
<p class="p1">German girl, and received from Zuleime the finished coiffure pinned up</p>
<p class="p1">in a paper, she said—</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“That cup of coffee will give me strength to go through my heavy part</p>
<p class="p1">to-night, but will leave me at its close more exhausted than ever; thus</p>
<p class="p1">I discount future health and life for present bread.” And so she went</p>
<p class="p1">off, her eyes gleaming under the excitement of a stimulant narcotic, as</p>
<p class="p1">fatal, if not as disreputable, as opium or alcohol. Zuleime went up to</p>
<p class="p1">her own room, and prepared the frugal supper for herself and the two</p>
<p class="p1">children, that were still playing on the carpet. She got a double</p>
<p class="p1">portion of milk from the German people, on account of her little guest,</p>
<p class="p1">Ida declaring that she liked milk with corn cake crumbled in it better</p>
<p class="p1">than anything, it was so sweet. And then when the babe was undressed and</p>
<p class="p1">put to bed, the little girl’s eyes waxed heavy and dim, and Zuleime took</p>
<p class="p1">her down stairs into her mother’s room, and disrobed and washed and</p>
<p class="p1">prepared her for bed. And when the child was about to kiss her friend</p>
<p class="p1">and spring into bed, Zuleime said—</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Stop, Ida. Don’t you say your prayers?”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“No, ma’am.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“But don’t you wish to?”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Oh, yes, ma’am,” said the child, and running back, she kneeled down at</p>
<p class="p1">Zuleime’s knees, and placed her little hands together and looked up for</p>
<p class="p1">instruction.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Zuleime thought the shortest, simplest infant’s prayer she knew of was</p>
<p class="p1">the best, because readily understood and easily remembered. And so she</p>
<p class="p1">took the little one’s folded hands between her own, and bade her repeat</p>
<p class="p1">after her—</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">                   </span>“Now I lay me down to sleep,</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">                   </span>I pray the Lord my soul to keep.</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">                   </span>If I should die before I wake,</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">                   </span>I pray the Lord my soul to take.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“That is a sweet little verse. What _is_ my soul?” asked the child.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Zuleime hesitated, puzzled for an answer; then she said for want of a</p>
<p class="p1">better—</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“It is what you think with, and wonder with, and what you are sorry or</p>
<p class="p1">glad with, and what will live forever.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“I love you with it then. Good-night, good, pretty lady.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Good-night, sweet child.” And Zuleime laid her in the bed, and kissed</p>
<p class="p1">her fair eyelids down to slumber.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>

<p class="p1">living. But in the days when Zuleime lived and suffered, it was even</p>
<p class="p1">more so. It was especially hard in Virginia, where, owing to the</p>
<p class="p1">prevalence of the law of entail, the rich were very rich, and the poor</p>
<p class="p1">very poor. Where, besides, ladies took pride in their domestic and</p>
<p class="p1">industrious habits, the favorite and most inveterate of which was that</p>
<p class="p1">of doing their own sewing, forgetful of the poor widow and orphan, who</p>
<p class="p1">might be suffering for the want of the work. It was for such reasons</p>
<p class="p1">that Zuleime found little or no employment—at most of the houses where</p>
<p class="p1">she applied she was told that—“We never give out needle-work,” or that,</p>
<p class="p1">“The ladies of the house do all the family sewing.” All very well, in</p>
<p class="p1">moderation. Industry is a praiseworthy habit, when it does not</p>
<p class="p1">compromise justice and mercy—when it does not hinder us to “live and let</p>
<p class="p1">live.” Let us be different in our several callings; but for Heaven’s</p>
<p class="p1">sake, if we can possibly afford it, let us never refuse to give work to</p>
<p class="p1">those who need, or who ask it of us. They may be suffering for it, they</p>
<p class="p1">may be starving for it, they may be dying for it, as Zuleime was. They</p>
<p class="p1">may be driven to vice, to crime, for the want of it, as Zuleime was not,</p>
<p class="p1">thank Heaven. Reader, this portion of my story at least is no fiction.</p>
<p class="p1">Nor was Zuleime’s case _then_ a solitary one. Nor would it be such</p>
<p class="p1">_now_. There are many poor women, in every city, who have not work</p>
<p class="p1">enough to earn their necessary food and fuel. And this is one of the</p>
<p class="p1">causes:—There are hundreds of ladies, of the middle classes of society,</p>
<p class="p1">who work themselves nearly to death, and really shorten their lives, by</p>
<p class="p1">sewing for their large families, in order to save money to lay out in</p>
<p class="p1">dress for themselves and children, more genteel than needful; or in</p>
<p class="p1">furniture, which they do not live very long to enjoy. And all this time</p>
<p class="p1">there are hundreds of poor women around them suffering for a part of</p>
<p class="p1">this very work with which _they_ are killing themselves. Yes, hundreds</p>
<p class="p1">who die annually of innutrition—a slow, cruelly slow starvation,</p>
<p class="p1">prolonged from month to month, or from year to year, according to their</p>
<p class="p1">relative strength of constitution. I know it. For I have lived among</p>
<p class="p1">them, and seen for myself, and not another. The doctors call the want,</p>
<p class="p1">of which they die, consumption—I think it is rather _non_-consumption.</p>
<p class="p1">Zuleime sank deeper and deeper into penury. As autumn advanced into</p>
<p class="p1">winter, and as her necessities increased, her ability to supply them</p>
<p class="p1">decreased. Her poverty began to betray itself sadly in her personal</p>
<p class="p1">appearance. Her face was thin and wan, with great, bright, hungry</p>
<p class="p1">looking eyes—her hands wasted to semi-transparency. Her only gown, her</p>
<p class="p1">black bombazine, was rusty and threadbare, and embossed with darns—her</p>
<p class="p1">shoes were so bad as to look scarcely decent. And amid all her other</p>
<p class="p1">troubles, there was room for humiliated feelings upon even this account.</p>
<p class="p1">The present was wretched—the future hopeless. She had heard of people</p>
<p class="p1">perishing from cold and hunger, and to such an end she thought her life</p>
<p class="p1">seemed tending. Yet miserable as was the condition of Zuleime, there</p>
<p class="p1">were many then, are many now, in much worse situations. She at least was</p>
<p class="p1">starving in a tolerably clean room, in privacy and in peace. Far happier</p>
<p class="p1">than some who perish in the midst of vice and filth and squalor. Yes,</p>
<p class="p1">reader, there are such things; they _do_ exist in my neighborhood, and</p>
<p class="p1">yours, and it is just as well that they should sometimes be remembered.</p>
<p class="p1">Zuleime was dying of want. And did the people of the house know nothing</p>
<p class="p1">of this? Yes, they knew something of it, and her German landlord</p>
<p class="p1">trembled for his rent, his wife wished that they had never seen the poor</p>
<p class="p1">thing, and the two girls pitied her very deeply. And Mrs. Knight saw it</p>
<p class="p1">all, and suffered in sympathy, and gave the poor, dying girl, all the</p>
<p class="p1">work she had to give, and paid her for doing it as liberally as she</p>
<p class="p1">could afford. But Mrs. Knight was not able, from her scanty salary, to</p>
<p class="p1">keep up her expensive, professional wardrobe, and support two families</p>
<p class="p1">besides. The greater part of the money Zuleime made, by sewing for the</p>
<p class="p1">poor actress, was paid for rent, to keep the roof over her head that</p>
<p class="p1">bitter weather, and to supply the daily two pence worth of milk for the</p>
<p class="p1">child. If a few pence were left over, they were spent in cheap pilot</p>
<p class="p1">bread, sparingly eaten by herself. For weeks together she had no fire,</p>
<p class="p1">no fuel, but would manage to keep her child warm by seating her in the</p>
<p class="p1">middle of the bed, well wrapped up. By the side of the head of the</p>
<p class="p1">bedstead, and looking to the south, was the only back window of her</p>
<p class="p1">room. When she had work, she would sit by this window and sew, while her</p>
<p class="p1">child sat wrapped up in the bed. When she had no work, she would still</p>
<p class="p1">sit there and rock her child upon her bosom, singing to her all the</p>
<p class="p1">while. Unearthly and spiritual was the wan, moonlight face, with its</p>
<p class="p1">large, luminous eyes—unearthly and spiritual was the voice in which she</p>
<p class="p1">sang her child to rest, as she sat by the south window. She found room</p>
<p class="p1">in her burdened heart to love that sunny window, with its glimpses of a</p>
<p class="p1">river landscape, with waterfalls and hills and forests, and nearer,</p>
<p class="p1">lying between her and the water, the pleasure-grounds around a fair</p>
<p class="p1">mansion of white freestone, that fronted on the river. That fine place</p>
<p class="p1">took in nearly a whole square, and was separated from this poor house</p>
<p class="p1">and lot, first, by a broad, back alley, then a tall brick wall, with</p>
<p class="p1">capacious stables and coach-houses, then the garden, with terraces and</p>
<p class="p1">conservatory, and so up to the Venetian back piazza of the mansion.</p>
<p class="p1">Every day, and all day long through the glowing autumn weather, she had</p>
<p class="p1">sat and feasted her eyes and mind upon these pleasure-grounds, with</p>
<p class="p1">their gorgeous flowers and magnificent trees, and the palace-home in the</p>
<p class="p1">midst, a picture of beauty and glory, telling besides of plenty,</p>
<p class="p1">elegance, refinement, leisure, artistic taste, intellectual pursuits,</p>
<p class="p1">family union, domestic happiness. Many a time, when going out to look</p>
<p class="p1">for work, she had walked quite around the square to get in front of the</p>
<p class="p1">mansion, and satisfy her soul with the architectural beauty and elegance</p>
<p class="p1">of the edifice, as it stood elevated by a flight of terraces far above</p>
<p class="p1">the street, and commanding for many miles the mighty course of the</p>
<p class="p1">river. Often in the autumn weather, had she walked under this southern</p>
<p class="p1">wall, and even in the midst of her deep distresses, looked up in</p>
<p class="p1">childish longing at the splendid autumnal flowers, trailing luxuriantly</p>
<p class="p1">over the iron railing. Why did this place interest her so? Not because</p>
<p class="p1">it was a palace-home, in such strong contrast to her own poor</p>
<p class="p1">dwelling—not because she passed it almost every day—not because its</p>
<p class="p1">magnificent grounds were ever before her sight from her own poor room.</p>
<p class="p1">Ah, no! But because there was a rural character, and a fine, old,</p>
<p class="p1">ancestral look about the place, that reminded her of her dear, lost</p>
<p class="p1">home. Everything connected with the premises interested her, even that</p>
<p class="p1">capacious family carriage, with its round bodied, gray coach horses, and</p>
<p class="p1">its fat coachman, which appeared every afternoon at a certain hour to</p>
<p class="p1">take the family out to drive. She did not care to inquire who lived</p>
<p class="p1">there. One day, when walking in front of the house on the other street,</p>
<p class="p1">she had seen a lady in deep mourning come out and get in the carriage.</p>
<p class="p1">She had time to see that the lady appeared bowed in grief, but possessed</p>
<p class="p1">so sweet and benevolent a face, that she was encouraged to call and ask</p>
<p class="p1">for work. So the next day she entered the beautiful grounds, and</p>
<p class="p1">ascended the stone steps that led flight by flight up the rising</p>
<p class="p1">terraces until she reached the Grecian portico and rang the bell. The</p>
<p class="p1">door was opened by a man servant, to whom she communicated her business.</p>
<p class="p1">He called a waiting-woman, who came, and after hearing what the visitor</p>
<p class="p1">wanted, explained civilly enough that all their needle-work was done by</p>
<p class="p1">a young person, who lived companion to her mistress, who was too infirm</p>
<p class="p1">to see strangers. Zuleime never tried there again. But the sweet,</p>
<p class="p1">sorrowful face of the lady haunted her, and she gazed from her poor</p>
<p class="p1">window upon the magnificent pleasure-grounds with more of interest than</p>
<p class="p1">ever.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Truly the world _is_ “full of paper walls.” How little Zuleime surmised</p>
<p class="p1">that the mourner in the palace sorrowed over the very same bereavement</p>
<p class="p1">that had laid her own life waste—that the fair-haired, tender-eyed lady,</p>
<p class="p1">whose grief-worn countenance haunted her so, was the mother of her lost</p>
<p class="p1">Frank; that the proud mansion-house, in the midst of its</p>
<p class="p1">pleasure-grounds, was the rightful inheritance of the poor babe that</p>
<p class="p1">rested on her wasted bosom.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">How little did the childless and desolate recluse of the palace guess</p>
<p class="p1">that her lost son’s widow sat pining, starving so near her! The world is</p>
<p class="p1">full of paper walls, but fate makes them firmer, stronger, more</p>
<p class="p1">indestructible than adamant.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Upon that very same December night that found Mrs. Clifton and Catherine</p>
<p class="p1">rejoicing over the good news they had heard from their friends, upon</p>
<p class="p1">that very night Zuleime sat shivering in her room, without fire, food or</p>
<p class="p1">light. She had given her child its cup of milk, and thanked Heaven that</p>
<p class="p1">she had it to give, though she herself went hungry. And she had wrapped</p>
<p class="p1">the babe in her shawl, and sat by the window, singing and rocking her to</p>
<p class="p1">sleep. The room was intensely cold, she was chilled to the heart, her</p>
<p class="p1">feet were numb, and almost lifeless. The only warmth in her body seemed</p>
<p class="p1">to be the bosom at which the child was pressed. The snow was falling</p>
<p class="p1">fast without, but even through its flakes she saw the lighted windows of</p>
<p class="p1">the mansion-house glowing through the crimson curtains, and streaming</p>
<p class="p1">redly across the snow-clad ground. And she sat and thought of the</p>
<p class="p1">comforts within that parlor. While she sat there thinking, there came a</p>
<p class="p1">gentle knock at her door.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Who is there?” inquired Zuleime.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“It is I, Mrs. Fairfax,” replied the voice of the actress.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Come in, Mrs. Knight.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">The actress entered, saying, with a little pardonable tact—</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Oh, you are putting your child to sleep in the dark. It is singular</p>
<p class="p1">some little ones never will go to sleep where there is a light burning.</p>
<p class="p1">_Is_ she asleep?”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Yes,” replied Zuleime.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Then please put her in bed, my dear, and come down stairs with me. I</p>
<p class="p1">have something to talk to you about.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Zuleime laid her little girl in bed, and tottering with weakness, from</p>
<p class="p1">her long fast and the cold, accompanied the actress down stairs.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Mrs. Knight opened her own room, and revealed a warm coal fire burning</p>
<p class="p1">in the grate, and a little supper-table set out, with coffee, French</p>
<p class="p1">rolls, nice butter, and stewed oysters. She set the cushioned</p>
<p class="p1">rocking-chair for Zuleime, between the fire and the table, and pushed</p>
<p class="p1">her gently into the seat, saying—</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“I have holyday to-night, and for a week from to-night, because the</p>
<p class="p1">opera troupe are here. And so I thought I would just celebrate its</p>
<p class="p1">commencement by a supper and a ball for two!” And she placed before her</p>
<p class="p1">visitor a plate of oysters and a cup of coffee. When the little supper</p>
<p class="p1">was fairly commenced, Mrs. Knight said, “I did not send for you, only to</p>
<p class="p1">take coffee with me—I wished to speak to you on a matter of business. I</p>
<p class="p1">have been wishing some time to do so, but scarcely knew how to do it</p>
<p class="p1">without wounding or offending you.” She paused.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Ah! are you so considerate? Yet you need not fear—I know _you_ could</p>
<p class="p1">not think of anything to say which would—</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“At least, I only mean your good, and if I err, you will forgive me.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Gentle friend! I am used to all the hardness and vulgarity against</p>
<p class="p1">which a woman has to break her heart and spirit, in struggling through</p>
<p class="p1">the rough world. Now think of that. And think whether I can be hurt by</p>
<p class="p1">anything your kind heart impels you to say. No, I shall be very</p>
<p class="p1">grateful!”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Well, this is it, then, my dear. I have not been able to avoid seeing</p>
<p class="p1">your fruitless efforts to maintain yourself and child, for the last</p>
<p class="p1">three months. I fear you have scarcely made five shillings a week.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“I have not made that for the last month.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“And there seems to be no chance of doing better—with your needle, I</p>
<p class="p1">mean.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Ah, no, no.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“And your situation is getting worse every day. Poor child! your very</p>
<p class="p1">shoes are almost gone—there—forgive me—I have spoken rudely.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“No, no—you have spoken the truth in love. Any truth can be told in the</p>
<p class="p1">spirit of love.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“And you are wasting away—you will be thrown upon your sick bed—then</p>
<p class="p1">what will become of your child?”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Alas, God knows! If we both could die—”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Yes, if you both _could_. Death is no evil at all.” As the actress said</p>
<p class="p1">this, her hollow, shadowy face grew dark, and her large, luminous eyes</p>
<p class="p1">glanced aside, and fell upon the door—fixed in an intense, suffering,</p>
<p class="p1">almost querulous gaze—as if of one enduring pain. “It must come abruptly</p>
<p class="p1">at last,” she said, looking up, suddenly. “My dear, have you any</p>
<p class="p1">insurmountable prejudices against a theatrical life for yourself?”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Startled by the abruptness of the proposition, Zuleime raised her eyes</p>
<p class="p1">to the beautiful, dark, irritated countenance before her, without</p>
<p class="p1">replying.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“You don’t understand me. Well, then, to put it plainer, if nothing</p>
<p class="p1">better at all could be found for you, would you absolutely refuse to go</p>
<p class="p1">upon the stage?”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Zuleime had understood her very well, and if she still hesitated, it was</p>
<p class="p1">from a reluctance to wound the spirit of the actress.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Do you, then, consider the histrionic profession disreputable?” asked</p>
<p class="p1">Mrs. Knight, with the same suffering, querulous, almost cross expression</p>
<p class="p1">of the eyes.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“No,” said Zuleime, very gently, “I do not. Not the profession that Mrs.</p>
<p class="p1">Siddons ennobled. I think it truly</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">                   </span>“‘The youngest of the sister arts,</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">                   </span>Where all their beauties blend.’”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Well, then, my question—Would you object to going on the stage</p>
<p class="p1">yourself?”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“I am not fit for it,” replied Zuleime, evasively.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“I do not know that. I need not tell you that you are young and pretty,</p>
<p class="p1">and singularly graceful—nor that you have a very fine voice for</p>
<p class="p1">singing—these form a very good foundation. And in elocution, my dear, I</p>
<p class="p1">would myself become your instructress. What say you?”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“That you are kinder to me than any one has ever been since I left home;</p>
<p class="p1">and that I am very, very grateful,” Zuleime said, very gently.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“But that you despise the calling too thoroughly to follow it, even for</p>
<p class="p1">bread,” said the actress, bitterly.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“No, no—I did not say or mean that, indeed—but I, you see, have neither</p>
<p class="p1">the taste, talent, nor courage requisite!”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Why not?”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“I was brought up in the privacy of domestic life; in the deep seclusion</p>
<p class="p1">of the country. I have never been used to _society_, much less to</p>
<p class="p1">_publicity_, and I am sure, that no matter how well I might be</p>
<p class="p1">instructed in my part, when I should come before an audience, I should</p>
<p class="p1">forget all about it, and half die of shame.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Ah, I suppose you have no vocation for it. An actress forgets her own</p>
<p class="p1">identity in that of the character she represents, and that enables her</p>
<p class="p1">to go through things she could not otherwise endure. But, my dear, I do</p>
<p class="p1">not see anything else you can do; and as for the ‘stage fright,’ as it</p>
<p class="p1">is called among us, you would soon get that off.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Zuleime shook her head.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“My dear, you do not yet know the plan I have for you. I never</p>
<p class="p1">thought—no one would ever think of a sudden grand debut for _you_.</p>
<p class="p1">Nothing but great genius, strong vocation, and perfect self-possession</p>
<p class="p1">on the part of the _debutante_, would justify such a thing. No—the art</p>
<p class="p1">must be acquired, as other arts are—slowly. This is the plan I had for</p>
<p class="p1">you, and it entirely precludes the possibility of a stage fright, since</p>
<p class="p1">you are gradually inured to it. Do you understand me, now?”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“No, I do not!”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Well, then, for instance—and to come to the point! The opera season is</p>
<p class="p1">about to commence, and the manager wishes to engage about half a dozen</p>
<p class="p1">young girls as chorus singers. Will you be one? The lowest salary they</p>
<p class="p1">ever give a chorus singer is six dollars a week—that is four times as</p>
<p class="p1">much as you ever earned by the tedious needle. Will you consent?”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Still Zuleime was silent.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“After the opera season is over, I make no doubt that your youth, beauty</p>
<p class="p1">and grace, and your very fine voice, will secure you a permanent</p>
<p class="p1">engagement at an advanced salary. Will you go with me to the manager</p>
<p class="p1">to-morrow?”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“No,” said Zuleime, “I should not dare to go upon the stage. I could not</p>
<p class="p1">face an audience.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“And you need not face them! You would be in a group of young girls, and</p>
<p class="p1">no one would notice you, except casually as a part of the scenery. The</p>
<p class="p1">attention of the audience is taken up with the principal performers.</p>
<p class="p1">Besides, no one will know who you are. Your name need not appear upon</p>
<p class="p1">the bills. I will take every care of your feelings, if, indeed, you can</p>
<p class="p1">be sensible of them when hunger and cold are felt.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“I do not like the life,” said Zuleime. “I had almost as willingly</p>
<p class="p1">starve.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">The actress arose and rung the bell.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Oh! it is nothing to me, Mrs. Fairfax. Do as you please. I have no</p>
<p class="p1">earthly interest to serve in persuading you to this step,” she said,</p>
<p class="p1">with the old, cross, querulous look on her haggard face, and in her</p>
<p class="p1">beautiful dark, gray eyes.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Bertha came in and cleared away the table.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Mrs. Knight walked up and down the room in a hasty. irritated manner.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“I wish I was at work again! I am sick of my holyday already! Since I</p>
<p class="p1">cannot afford to abandon this hateful art, I wish I were always delving</p>
<p class="p1">at it, and there came no pause for self-recollection. I wish I were</p>
<p class="p1">perpetually Queen Katherine, Mrs. Haller, Isabella, Imogene, Lady</p>
<p class="p1">Macbeth, Bianca Fazio, and the others, going incessantly through the</p>
<p class="p1">circle like the earth through the signs of the zodiac. I wish I were</p>
<p class="p1">always somebody else, anybody else than poor Ida Knight.” And she threw</p>
<p class="p1">herself into a chair, glancing at Zuleime with a strained, appealing,</p>
<p class="p1">accusing look. But the wan face of the dying girl, with its hectic</p>
<p class="p1">flush, smote the rock in her heart, and she moved to her side and took</p>
<p class="p1">her hand and said, gently, though with the same tone and look of</p>
<p class="p1">querulous suffering. “It _is_ a wretched life! I feel it so—only it is</p>
<p class="p1">not so bad as starving, and seeing your child starve. My dear, it _is_</p>
<p class="p1">something to me whether I persuade you to do this thing or not. I cannot</p>
<p class="p1">bear to see you suffer so. Your necessities weigh upon my heart in</p>
<p class="p1">addition to my own. And really,” she added, with the same frowning,</p>
<p class="p1">irritated look, “really, I have such a burden of my own, that I grow</p>
<p class="p1">restive under a feather of anybody else’s.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Then do not take my sorrows on your shoulders, dear lady; I can bear</p>
<p class="p1">them myself, or die under their weight uncomplainingly. Do not take my</p>
<p class="p1">troubles to heart!” said Zuleime, gently.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">The actress looked up with a sharp, rebuking glance, saying—</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“As if I could help it! You are not sincere when you ask me to do so!</p>
<p class="p1">No, the only way I can get your griefs off my heart is to get them off</p>
<p class="p1">your own. I must get you into _living_ circumstances. I must persuade</p>
<p class="p1">you to go on the stage with me. It is not a pleasant profession for a</p>
<p class="p1">lady, I grant you—neither is freezing or starving, and getting into debt</p>
<p class="p1">and being dunned and rebuffed, pleasant—but—” she added, with a look of</p>
<p class="p1">almost fierce self-assertion and self-defence—“neither is it actually</p>
<p class="p1">_sinful_, that I know of. It necessarily transgresses no command of God</p>
<p class="p1">with which I am acquainted. One need not be a heathen because she is an</p>
<p class="p1">actress. Mrs. Siddons was a member in full communion with the Church of</p>
<p class="p1">England. The stage has its dangers, I grant you, but you may safely pass</p>
<p class="p1">through them, if you please. I have done so! I was not born or brought</p>
<p class="p1">up to that life, my dear; I was the daughter of an English country</p>
<p class="p1">curate—then a nursery governess—then a traveling companion to an earl’s</p>
<p class="p1">daughter—then I accidentally met with my husband, and we married from</p>
<p class="p1">mutual affection. He was a tragedian—that is the way in which I became</p>
<p class="p1">an actress. Now I follow the histrionic profession as the only means of</p>
<p class="p1">living left open to me. I have seen the dangers—nay, I have _felt_ them.</p>
<p class="p1">But nightly—no matter how utterly wearied out with toil I may have been,</p>
<p class="p1">I have uttered two lines of sincere prayer, that God would keep me from</p>
<p class="p1">falling into deeper sin. And He has kept me! Does that surprise you? God</p>
<p class="p1">is the God of the publican as well as of the Pharisee. Who dares</p>
<p class="p1">excommunicate me? What child of the Universal Father shall dare to say</p>
<p class="p1">that another is excluded from His love and care and protection? Verily,</p>
<p class="p1">the day of Judgment will be a day of startling revelations. And many</p>
<p class="p1">that are first shall be last, and the last shall be first.” And then the</p>
<p class="p1">actress fell into silence, and her fine countenance lost that look of</p>
<p class="p1">captious self-defence, and settled into meditative earnestness.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Zuleime arose to go. Mrs. Knight took her hand, and said, gently—</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“My dear, think over what I have proposed to you. If you decide to</p>
<p class="p1">accept my proposition, I will take every possible care of you. You shall</p>
<p class="p1">be as my own daughter. I will shield you from all dangers. I will</p>
<p class="p1">instruct you in your art. And I will give you the freedom of my</p>
<p class="p1">wardrobe. Good-night. Will you kiss me?”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">And she drew Zuleime to her bosom. The poor girl pressed her lips to</p>
<p class="p1">those of the actress, and slipping through the door, passed up in the</p>
<p class="p1">dark and cold to her own room.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Ida went to bed, but the poor, generous, irritable woman could not sleep</p>
<p class="p1">for sympathy, for anxiety, and for the sound of Zuleime’s racking cough.</p>
<p class="p1">“She will never be able to sing much, I am really afraid. But she shall</p>
<p class="p1">be paid well for dressing, and for making her beautiful face and form a</p>
<p class="p1">part of the pageantry—that I am determined upon, if I have any influence</p>
<p class="p1">with the management,” thought Ida, as she sank to sleep.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Rusty and threadbare clothing, broken shoes, cold, hunger, and a</p>
<p class="p1">suffering child, are forcible arguments, and they seconded the</p>
<p class="p1">persuasions of Ida with tremendous power.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Zuleime yielded, and was carried down the current of fate as easily,</p>
<p class="p1">with as little resistance as the sapling beaten down by the rain,</p>
<p class="p1">uprooted by the wind, and carried off by the flood, is whirled down the</p>
<p class="p1">stream.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">It was the fatal night of the 26th of December, 1811, the night of the</p>
<p class="p1">burning of the Richmond Theatre, a night ever to be remembered in the</p>
<p class="p1">annals of that city, and ever to be mourned in the hearts of her</p>
<p class="p1">citizens. That evening more than six hundred lovers of pleasure were</p>
<p class="p1">gayly preparing for the theatre; not dreaming, alas! that they also were</p>
<p class="p1">doomed to take fearful part in an awful tragedy—a tragedy unprecedented</p>
<p class="p1">in the history of the stage. Before eight o’clock, more than six hundred</p>
<p class="p1">persons, from pleasant city homes all around, assembled in the fated</p>
<p class="p1">building; before twelve o’clock, more than one hundred had perished</p>
<p class="p1">horribly in the flames! and the scarcely surviving five hundred, many</p>
<p class="p1">wounded, maimed, or burned, all despairingly mourning the awful fate of</p>
<p class="p1">nearest relatives and friends, returned or were borne back to their</p>
<p class="p1">desolate homes!</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">That afternoon, unprophetic of doom as any of the others, Zuleime and</p>
<p class="p1">her friend were preparing to go on the stage. Zuleime had no part to</p>
<p class="p1">perform—she was as yet only an attaché—and was to appear but in one</p>
<p class="p1">scene, as one of a group of villagers. She was engaged in fixing up a</p>
<p class="p1">peasant dress, consisting of a straw hat, black spencer, short gray</p>
<p class="p1">skirt, and striped stockings. Mrs. Knight was, as usual, doing two</p>
<p class="p1">things at once—arranging her costume and studying her part. But the eyes</p>
<p class="p1">of Ida often wandered towards Zuleime, as she heard that hacking,</p>
<p class="p1">racking cough, and she noticed with pain the waning face. Yes! within a</p>
<p class="p1">few days even, the thin face had become perceptibly thinner, and the</p>
<p class="p1">flushed cheek burned with a darker crimson. “And she will make a sorry</p>
<p class="p1">looking peasant,” thought Ida; “a very sorry peasant, with that</p>
<p class="p1">delicate, spiritual, almost ærial face and form of hers. How absurdly</p>
<p class="p1">inappropriate are most of the affairs we get up! Truly, our art is in</p>
<p class="p1">the rear of all others. Now, this evening, all go on as villagers—vulgar</p>
<p class="p1">and refined—all reduced to one level. Those coarse, brawny Miss</p>
<p class="p1">Butchers, and this fragile, delicate Zuleime, all peasants—very well for</p>
<p class="p1">the Miss Butchers, but for Zuleime! To-morrow evening all go on as</p>
<p class="p1">faries; excellent well for this ærial Zuleime, but for the Miss</p>
<p class="p1">Butchers! Well, our notions are fanciful as arbitrary—and there may be</p>
<p class="p1">peasants who have delicate, white, semi-transparent fingers, and there</p>
<p class="p1">may be faries with large, flat feet, and great red hands, for aught we</p>
<p class="p1">know.” While Mrs. Knight silently cogitated, and covered her white satin</p>
<p class="p1">shoes anew, and studied her part, Zuleime worked on also in silence, but</p>
<p class="p1">too despairing, too exhausted, even to think of the wayward fate which</p>
<p class="p1">had brought her to this pass.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">At about sunset their preparations were completed. Ida, as usual, rang</p>
<p class="p1">for her cup of coffee and her errand boy, and packed up and sent away</p>
<p class="p1">the costume for the evening. Then she put her own little girl and</p>
<p class="p1">Zuleime’s child to sleep together in her bed, and got Bertha to promise</p>
<p class="p1">to look in, in the course of the evening, and see that all was safe. And</p>
<p class="p1">then poor Ida carefully wrapped Zuleime up in her own mantilla, and</p>
<p class="p1">wound her own furs around her neck, saying, in answer to all</p>
<p class="p1">expostulation—</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Never mind _me_, my dear! I’ve got no cough. Haggard as I look, I’m</p>
<p class="p1">whit-leather! _You_ must take care of your poor little self.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">And then they left the house, walking briskly through the biting air,</p>
<p class="p1">and crunching the crusted snow under their quick footsteps. Though but</p>
<p class="p1">little after sunset, owing to the heavy clouds, it was almost dark when</p>
<p class="p1">they hurried along the streets. There was the usual number of</p>
<p class="p1">foot-passengers abroad, and once, as the slight figure of a man in a</p>
<p class="p1">military cloak swiftly hurried past, Mrs. Knight felt her arm suddenly</p>
<p class="p1">grasped with spasmodic force by her companion, and turning around, she</p>
<p class="p1">saw the face of Zuleime deadly pale.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Why, what is the matter, my dear child?”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Nothing, nothing!” said Zuleime; “let us hurry on.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“But you are trembling like an aspen leaf! You have walked too far—you</p>
<p class="p1">are not strong enough for this evening’s work; let me take you home</p>
<p class="p1">again.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“No, no, no, no! let’s go on!”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Why, Zuleime—”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Oh, it is nothing—nothing when you hear it! I—I felt the presence of</p>
<p class="p1">one long dead! It was weak nerves, or fancy, or perhaps the prescience</p>
<p class="p1">of one on the confines of the unseen world. Let us hasten on.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">They hurried along. In the meantime, he who had passed them, the slight</p>
<p class="p1">man in the military cloak, walked on down the square, suddenly stopped,</p>
<p class="p1">muttered to himself, “Absurd! impossible!” then went on again, again</p>
<p class="p1">stopped, as by an irresistible impulse, turned and rapidly retraced his</p>
<p class="p1">steps, after the two ladies in black, overtook them, was close behind</p>
<p class="p1">them, but not placing any confidence in what he termed his own wild</p>
<p class="p1">thoughts, he dared not accost or peep under the bonnets of two reserved</p>
<p class="p1">and closely veiled women. But he kept them in sight until he saw them</p>
<p class="p1">enter the side door of the theatre. Then he asked a door-keeper—</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Who are those?”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Two of the ladies attached to the theatre,” replied the man.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Fool that I was!” exclaimed Frank Fairfax, as he turned away.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Captain Fairfax had reached Richmond that day at noon—too late, by half</p>
<p class="p1">a day, for the stage to L——, whither he would have gone, if possible, on</p>
<p class="p1">the wings of the wind. His mother, warned by the newspapers, had been</p>
<p class="p1">daily expecting his arrival, and was prepared to receive him when he</p>
<p class="p1">presented himself. He had spent the whole afternoon with her at Fairview</p>
<p class="p1">House, and in the evening had walked out to book his place in the next</p>
<p class="p1">day’s stage for L——. It was when hurrying along on that errand, that he</p>
<p class="p1">passed so near his wife, electrifying her with his unknown presence, and</p>
<p class="p1">being himself drawn to follow, and to hover near her all the evening.</p>
<p class="p1">For when he had turned from the theatre, and hurried on and reached the</p>
<p class="p1">stage office and secured his place, finding out that the coach did not</p>
<p class="p1">start till three o’clock the next morning, he said to himself—</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“How on earth shall I contrive to forget some of these miserable hours</p>
<p class="p1">that must intervene before I can fly to my wife? My mother’s ill-health</p>
<p class="p1">obliges her to retire early to bed. If I go back to Fairview House, I</p>
<p class="p1">shall have the whole mansion to myself. I will even go to the theatre,</p>
<p class="p1">and see if I can find out among the women there the particular one whose</p>
<p class="p1">air and gait reminded me so strongly of my Zuleime.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">And so to the theatre he went. It was quite early, and he was fortunate</p>
<p class="p1">in securing a seat in the centre of the first row of boxes, immediately</p>
<p class="p1">in front of the stage. In the meantime, Zuleime had been conducted by</p>
<p class="p1">Mrs. Knight into the theatre, and introduced into the common</p>
<p class="p1">dressing-room of the stock actresses. This was a large room, with a</p>
<p class="p1">broad shelf or dresser running around three sides of the walls, and</p>
<p class="p1">about four feet from the floor. This served as bureaus, dressing-tables,</p>
<p class="p1">and wash-stands for nine women, each of the three sides being occupied</p>
<p class="p1">by three, who equally divided the shelf, each one having her hand-boxes</p>
<p class="p1">under the shelf, and her looking-glass on top of it, leaning against the</p>
<p class="p1">wall, and her wash-basin, jars of rouge, boxes of powder, pots of</p>
<p class="p1">pomatum, etc., standing around it. On introducing her companion into</p>
<p class="p1">this apartment, Mrs. Knight said—</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“All women belonging to the theatre use this as a common dressing-room,</p>
<p class="p1">except the ballet girls, who have one to themselves, and the stars, who</p>
<p class="p1">have separate and well furnished rooms.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">About half a dozen women were present now, each before her own glass,</p>
<p class="p1">with her own tallow candle, making her toilet.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Who’s that, Knight, that you’ve got there?” asked a coarse-featured,</p>
<p class="p1">black-eyed girl, who always played the hoyden, or the wit, and fondly</p>
<p class="p1">believed herself a proficient in the Rosalind and Beatrice line. “I say,</p>
<p class="p1">Knight! is that the young ‘lady?’” she repeated, turning around with a</p>
<p class="p1">little wad of raw cotton, dipped in carmine, between her finger and</p>
<p class="p1">thumb, and exhibiting a face in process of being rejuvenated—namely,</p>
<p class="p1">with one young and blooming cheek, and one prematurely old and sallow.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Yes, this is the young lady, Barry,” said Mrs. Knight, very gravely, as</p>
<p class="p1">she led her protégé off to her own corner of the common dresser.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“I think she might have sent her down with the ballet girls, as she is</p>
<p class="p1">really one of them,” grumbled a large, important looking female,</p>
<p class="p1">arranging a huge turban and curls upon her head, at the farther end of</p>
<p class="p1">the room. Two new ideas besides that of the common dressing-room and the</p>
<p class="p1">dressing shelf in general, Zuleime had got—namely, first, that there</p>
<p class="p1">really was some very lofty notions of rank and exclusiveness even among</p>
<p class="p1">the members of the stock company of a second rate theatre—secondly, that</p>
<p class="p1">they really, after all, did not differ much in that or any other respect</p>
<p class="p1">from people she had met in very high society, except, indeed, that they</p>
<p class="p1">had the odious habit of calling each other “Knight” or “Barry,” as men</p>
<p class="p1">do, without a prefix of any sort.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Mrs. Knight dressed herself for her part, as she was to appear in the</p>
<p class="p1">early scene in the play, and then gave the use of her toilet nook to</p>
<p class="p1">Zuleime. But the cold walk through the evening air, and the standing in</p>
<p class="p1">the chilly dressing-room, had so increased her cough, that Mrs. Knight</p>
<p class="p1">went out and sent a call-boy for opium, and administered a dose. It was</p>
<p class="p1">under the influence of that stupefier that Zuleime, leaning on the arm</p>
<p class="p1">of Mrs. Knight, entered that terra-incognita, the green-room. It was a</p>
<p class="p1">long room, papered, curtained, carpeted, furnished with sofas and</p>
<p class="p1">easy-chairs, and warmed by a fine coal fire—upon the whole it differed</p>
<p class="p1">in no other respect than its motley crowd, from a large family parlor.</p>
<p class="p1">Mrs. Knight conducted her to a corner of the sofa nearest the fire, and</p>
<p class="p1">leaving her sitting there, obeyed the call-boy’s summons, and went upon</p>
<p class="p1">the stage. Composed into a dreamy state by the opium, Zuleime sat there</p>
<p class="p1">while the strange scene, with its fantastical crowd, passed before her</p>
<p class="p1">like the phantasmagoria of a midnight dream. And all this time Frank sat</p>
<p class="p1">in the centre box of the front row, not seeing the play enacting before</p>
<p class="p1">him—not thinking of it, only seeing the turnpike road to L——. Only</p>
<p class="p1">thinking of the dearest girl in the world, whom he should meet at the</p>
<p class="p1">end of his journey. Paper walls again!</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Zuleime remained in the corner of the sofa near the fire in the</p>
<p class="p1">green-room, not thinking at all, not even dreaming, only conscious in a</p>
<p class="p1">vague dreamy way, that a strange vision, changing and changing like</p>
<p class="p1">figures in the kaleidoscope, was passing before her. She was scarcely</p>
<p class="p1">aroused by Mrs. Knight’s gentle voice, saying in her ear—</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Come, my dear, it is time for you to go on now. Come, don’t be afraid.</p>
<p class="p1">Bless you, you are nobody, you know. No one will look at you. You will</p>
<p class="p1">be only one of a group that forms a sort of back-ground to the scene.</p>
<p class="p1">Come, I will go with you to the side entrance, where the others stand.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Zuleime obeyed mechanically, and was led, between various walls of</p>
<p class="p1">canvas, to a side entrance, at which were grouped a number of persons in</p>
<p class="p1">villagers’ costume.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“There, just go on with the crowd, and stand there, that is all you have</p>
<p class="p1">to do,” whispered Mrs. Knight, as she left her.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">And at the same moment the group moved on, carrying the somnolent</p>
<p class="p1">Zuleime with them, and she found herself in a dazzling glare of light,</p>
<p class="p1">and heard the deafening rant of a stentorian lunged actor near her, and</p>
<p class="p1">grew painfully conscious of the many hundred eyes upon the scene, upon</p>
<p class="p1">herself, perhaps—and dared not raise her eyes an instant from the floor,</p>
<p class="p1">upon which, with a deeply burning cheek, they were fixed. But suddenly</p>
<p class="p1">an attraction—a fatality—I know not what—but something stronger than her</p>
<p class="p1">fear, stronger than her will, drew her glance up to the centre box of</p>
<p class="p1">the front row, and her eyes met Frank’s eyes. Yes, there he sat, gazing</p>
<p class="p1">at her, astonished, fixed, spell-bound as by a nightmare, without the</p>
<p class="p1">power of moving or waking. She! she too, gazed for a moment. She was not</p>
<p class="p1">astonished at seeing him there, any more than she would have been</p>
<p class="p1">astonished at _dreaming_ of seeing him anywhere. It was all like a wild</p>
<p class="p1">dream, everything! It seemed not unnatural that he should form a part of</p>
<p class="p1">it. Only to her weakened and half-stupefied brain, the _last, nearest_</p>
<p class="p1">event was the most distinct—and so, strangely, she did not think of his</p>
<p class="p1">death or life, but only of the reproach she had brought upon _him_, her</p>
<p class="p1">proud Frank, in appearing there! and covering her face with both hands,</p>
<p class="p1">she sank to her knees upon the floor.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">It was lucky the drop-curtain fell just then. It was lucky the audience</p>
<p class="p1">took that by-scene for a part of the play. But to Zuleime it was still</p>
<p class="p1">like a fever-dream, from which she tried to wake. Like a dream the</p>
<p class="p1">drop-curtain had rolled down. But not like a dream was the rough seizure</p>
<p class="p1">of her arm by a girl who set her upon her feet, and said, in a not</p>
<p class="p1">unfriendly tone—</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“What did you do that for? _That_ warn’t a part of _your_ part.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“I—I—have,” began Zuleime, passing her hand back and forth across her</p>
<p class="p1">forehead, “I have been taking opium to stop my cough. I—never was used</p>
<p class="p1">to it, and I think it has bewildered me a little; don’t _you_ think so?”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“I think _something_ has! Wake up, and try to listen to what is going</p>
<p class="p1">on. Mr. —— is going to sing now. Come off.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">As the girl led her away between the walls of canvas, one of those</p>
<p class="p1">insignificant incidents occurred, upon which nevertheless the fate of</p>
<p class="p1">hundreds sometimes hang. Away among the back scenes through which they</p>
<p class="p1">passed to reach the green-room, there was a chandelier hanging flaring</p>
<p class="p1">in the draught. A boy seemed busy with it.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Hoist it up higher, sir, why don’t you?” exclaimed one of the players,</p>
<p class="p1">who happened to come up.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“If I do, it will set fire to the scenes,” replied the boy.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Confound your insolence, do you think I would give you the order, if</p>
<p class="p1">there were the least danger! Do as you are directed, sir.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">The boy obeyed; and the scenery instantly took fire. The chandelier was</p>
<p class="p1">hastily drawn down; the alarm was given in the rear of the stage, and a</p>
<p class="p1">scene shifter directed to cut the cords by which the combustible</p>
<p class="p1">material was suspended. But the man became panic struck and fled.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">The performers and their assistants in vain sought to take down the</p>
<p class="p1">scenery. The canvas was covered with a resinous composition, and the</p>
<p class="p1">draught of wind was strong; and Zuleime and her companion were swiftly</p>
<p class="p1">encircled by walls of blazing canvas. The strong girl, terror-stricken,</p>
<p class="p1">left her weak companion and fled. And the poor invalid, forgotten by all</p>
<p class="p1">in the terror and confusion, sank down overpowered, suffocated by the</p>
<p class="p1">heat and smoke. All this had happened in less than three minutes from</p>
<p class="p1">the raising of the chandelier.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">And at this time one of the performers was playing near the orchestra,</p>
<p class="p1">and the greater part of the stage, with its appalling danger, was</p>
<p class="p1">fatally concealed from the audience by the curtain. The flames spread</p>
<p class="p1">with the rapidity of lightning; and the first notice the audience had of</p>
<p class="p1">their danger, was the fire falling from the ceiling upon the head of the</p>
<p class="p1">performer. Even then many supposed it to be a part of the play, and were</p>
<p class="p1">for a short time restrained from flight by a cry from the stage that</p>
<p class="p1">there was no danger. But soon the fire flashed in every part of the</p>
<p class="p1">house with a rapidity horrible and appalling. Then terror seized upon</p>
<p class="p1">the hearts of all, and the audience broke up in confusion. Those in the</p>
<p class="p1">pit escaped by the pit entrance, and were every one saved. Those in the</p>
<p class="p1">boxes, who, had they known it, might _at first_ have escaped by way of</p>
<p class="p1">the pit, all turned and hurried towards the only door of egress into the</p>
<p class="p1">lobby. This door was unfortunately hung to open on the inside. And this</p>
<p class="p1">circumstance was fatally overlooked by the frenzied crowd, who pressed</p>
<p class="p1">and pressed against the door, trying to push it open, but really keeping</p>
<p class="p1">it fast closed. The fire advanced upon them, filling the house with</p>
<p class="p1">suffocating smoke, and with flame that seized the clothing of those</p>
<p class="p1">behind, goading them horribly to still more frantic pressure upon those</p>
<p class="p1">before. The most frightful uproar ensued; women shrieking, praying—men</p>
<p class="p1">groaning, expostulating; all crowding one upon another, or rather</p>
<p class="p1">hundreds upon hundreds, and all pressing towards the door that would not</p>
<p class="p1">yield. The pit was now a lake of fire, darting out huge tongues of flame</p>
<p class="p1">that wound themselves around the forms of the hindmost, who fell</p>
<p class="p1">shriveled into the blaze. Then arose cries of horror, anguish and</p>
<p class="p1">despair—children crying for lost parents, and parents calling in agony</p>
<p class="p1">upon the names of missing children—for in the fierce pushing and</p>
<p class="p1">struggling for life, parties got separated and families divided—children</p>
<p class="p1">forced from the parents, women from their protectors, and the weaker</p>
<p class="p1">unconsciously thrown down and trampled to death by the strong. Many,</p>
<p class="p1">half roasted, dropped into the burning pit; many with their garments in</p>
<p class="p1">flames, maddened by pain and terror, threw themselves headlong from the</p>
<p class="p1">windows, and met another death. Many even chanced to save their lives in</p>
<p class="p1">that way at the cost of broken limbs. And at last the door yielded; and</p>
<p class="p1">as many as possible escaped that way; but to what a life, alas! darkened</p>
<p class="p1">forever by the memory of dearest relatives and friends who perished in</p>
<p class="p1">the fire. The whole building was now in flames. In less than an hour all</p>
<p class="p1">was over. Naught remained but a heap of smoking ruins; and around them</p>
<p class="p1">the agonized crowd of those who lived and raved—and around these again,</p>
<p class="p1">an awe-struck, mourning city.</p>

<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">The spell that bound Captain Fairfax, when he recognized his wife upon</p>
<p class="p1">the stage, was broken by the fall of the drop-curtain. He instantly left</p>
<p class="p1">the boxes and hastened around behind the scenes. After many baffled</p>
<p class="p1">inquiries, and many misdirections, he prosecuted his search alone, and</p>
<p class="p1">at length found her prostrate form. The wind had blown the smoke and</p>
<p class="p1">flame in another direction, and she lay there uninjured, though</p>
<p class="p1">insensible, and in extremity of danger. He raised her, threw his cloak</p>
<p class="p1">around her, ran with her into the fresh air, called a hackney coach,</p>
<p class="p1">placed her in it, jumped in and took his seat by her side, drew her</p>
<p class="p1">insensible form within his arms, upon his bosom, and directed the</p>
<p class="p1">coachman to drive rapidly to Fairview House. As they passed swiftly</p>
<p class="p1">through the streets, the cry of “Fire! fire! fire!” rung through the</p>
<p class="p1">air, but he scarcely heard it. The rushing of crowds of people in the</p>
<p class="p1">opposite direction to that in which they were driving, frequently</p>
<p class="p1">impeded the progress of the carriage, but he scarcely knew it. All his</p>
<p class="p1">senses, all his thoughts, all his emotions were absorbed in the gentle</p>
<p class="p1">form that lay swooning on his bosom. And “Oh! how _thin_ she is! how</p>
<p class="p1">_thin_, good Heaven!” he groaned many times, as he held his arm around</p>
<p class="p1">the fragile waist, or felt the emaciated arm and hand, or pressed his</p>
<p class="p1">cheek against the wan face. “How thin she is, good Heaven, how thin! Is</p>
<p class="p1">this illness? Illness unto death, perhaps! Drive fast, coachman! Fast!”</p>
<p class="p1">He longed to lay her at rest upon her bed, that he might perchance</p>
<p class="p1">silence his anxiety. And—“Faster, coachman! Faster!” he continued to</p>
<p class="p1">cry, whenever the thickening crowd arrested the progress of the</p>
<p class="p1">carriage.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">At length they reached Fairview House. He lifted her out and bore her</p>
<p class="p1">into the hall. His mother had retired to rest long since; but he rang</p>
<p class="p1">the bell violently, and said, to the astonished servants, who came at</p>
<p class="p1">the summons—</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Go instantly and prepare a room for my wife. I have but just saved her</p>
<p class="p1">from the burning theatre!” The wonder-struck maids hurried to obey.</p>
<p class="p1">“Stop! Don’t disturb your mistress, on your lives,” he said, and with</p>
<p class="p1">this warning, dismissed them. To one of the men present, he exclaimed,</p>
<p class="p1">“Run instantly to Doctor Cummings, and ask him to hurry hither.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">The man disappeared to obey. And during the issuing of these orders,</p>
<p class="p1">Frank Fairfax was sitting on the sofa, sustaining the fainting form of</p>
<p class="p1">his wife with one arm, while with the other hand he unlaced the velvet</p>
<p class="p1">boddice. Presently one of the maids returned and announced that the room</p>
<p class="p1">was ready. And Frank raised and carried his precious burden up stairs,</p>
<p class="p1">into a pleasant front chamber, and laid her on a bed. Then, with the</p>
<p class="p1">assistance of one of the women, he got off the stage dress, and supplied</p>
<p class="p1">its place with one of his mother’s white wrappers, brought for the</p>
<p class="p1">purpose by one of the maids.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">He had scarcely done this, when the chamber door opened, and old Mrs.</p>
<p class="p1">Fairfax entered, roused up by the noise in and outside the house. She</p>
<p class="p1">came in, wrapped in a flannel dressing-gown, and saying, anxiously—</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“My dear Frank! they tell me that the Richmond Theatre is on fire. I am</p>
<p class="p1">so grateful that you are not there. Ah what is this? Who is that?” she</p>
<p class="p1">asked, perceiving the form of Zuleime upon the bed, and advancing</p>
<p class="p1">towards it. “Some sufferer you have saved from the fire, my dear Frank?</p>
<p class="p1">God bless your brave, kind heart, my dear boy. But you should not have</p>
<p class="p1">brought her in here—or you should not be here yourself. Retire, and</p>
<p class="p1">leave the lady to the care of myself and my women,” concluded the lady,</p>
<p class="p1">gravely.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“My dearest mother, yes! She is a sufferer I have saved from the fire! a</p>
<p class="p1">most beloved sufferer! my wife! my wife! Dearest mother, I cannot leave</p>
<p class="p1">her! I have a _right_ to stay here.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Here followed a wild, hasty disclosure of his imprudent marriage, kept</p>
<p class="p1">secret up to that moment. And then amid the grief and surprise of Mrs.</p>
<p class="p1">Fairfax, he also learned the fact of Mr. Clifton’s death, and of</p>
<p class="p1">Zuleime’s disappearance and suspected suicide. In bitter self-reproach,</p>
<p class="p1">Frank had made his confession—in deepest sorrow, he heard his mother’s</p>
<p class="p1">revelations.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“How much she must have suffered! Good Heaven! how much she must have</p>
<p class="p1">suffered!” he exclaimed. Then almost madly he cried, “Mother! look at</p>
<p class="p1">her! Look at her! Oh, tell me, do you think she can live?”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Mrs. Fairfax had been all this time chafing her temples with cologne,</p>
<p class="p1">while the two maids rubbed her hands and feet. But up to this instant</p>
<p class="p1">she had given no signs of recovery, or of consciousness. And the old</p>
<p class="p1">lady shook her head mournfully, and plunged Frank into deeper despair.</p>
<p class="p1">They persevered in their efforts for half an hour longer, and then she</p>
<p class="p1">sighed and opened her eyes. Her husband was bending over her. She met</p>
<p class="p1">his eyes, and smiled faintly in recognition, without astonishment, and</p>
<p class="p1">without joy—indeed she was too feeble for either—and murmuring, “Dearest</p>
<p class="p1">Frank,” she sank away again, fainting, they supposed, until her low</p>
<p class="p1">breathing revealed that she slept the sleep of utter prostration. And</p>
<p class="p1">how changed was now that countenance. The look of weariness, care and</p>
<p class="p1">sorrow had vanished, and the sweet, wan face wore the easy, confiding</p>
<p class="p1">air of infancy; and even in sleep, she must have felt the shelter of</p>
<p class="p1">protecting love around her, for often with closed eyes she smiled, as in</p>
<p class="p1">delighted visions! All night they watched beside her bed while she</p>
<p class="p1">slept. In the morning the doctor arrived. He had been absent all night,</p>
<p class="p1">by the couch of one who had been severely burned at the theatre, and</p>
<p class="p1">that accounted for his failure to come before morning; now, however, he</p>
<p class="p1">stood beside the patient with grave and thoughtful brow.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Doctor, for Heaven’s sake give me some hope of her. Tell me something</p>
<p class="p1">about her, at least! Is she ill?”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“She is very ill,” replied the physician.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“I cannot believe it! I will not believe it! See how sweetly she sleeps!</p>
<p class="p1">how comfortably! how free from suffering!”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Yes—but, my dear Captain Fairfax, there would be more hope if there</p>
<p class="p1">were more suffering—however, the case may be much more favorable than it</p>
<p class="p1">appears to me now; I cannot fully judge of it until she wakes.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Allow me to arouse her, then! Nay, I wish to do it! I have not spoken</p>
<p class="p1">to her yet! Let me wake her now!”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“By no means! It might prove fatal. Indeed, you must be very careful.</p>
<p class="p1">Her life hangs by a thread. Sleep will do her more good now than</p>
<p class="p1">anything else. When she awakes naturally, you may send for me at once.”</p>
<p class="p1">And so saying, the doctor took leave, without even writing a</p>
<p class="p1">prescription.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Soon after he left the house she opened her eyes again, and seeing</p>
<p class="p1">Frank, smiled faintly, and murmured—</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“My own—my dearest—dearest husband.” And in an instant her senses seemed</p>
<p class="p1">swallowed up again in sleep, which lasted half an hour, at the end of</p>
<p class="p1">which she awoke again, and looked around in uneasiness, and breathed,</p>
<p class="p1">half aloud,—“My child—my baby—my little Fan—” and then sank away again,</p>
<p class="p1">as if she were too feeble to retain her hold on consciousness.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“What is she talking about, dear mother?” inquired Frank, in the</p>
<p class="p1">extremity of anxiety, when he heard her words.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Mrs. Fairfax shook her head, and said she did not know. But the woman</p>
<p class="p1">who waited in the chamber came forward, and said that if her mistress</p>
<p class="p1">would excuse her interfering, _she_ would tell them what the young lady</p>
<p class="p1">meant.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Speak on, then, at once, in the name of the Lord!” exclaimed Frank,</p>
<p class="p1">impatiently.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Mrs. Fairfax endorsed his order. And then the woman informed her</p>
<p class="p1">mistress that she had known the sick young lady all the winter by</p>
<p class="p1">sight—that she had been there at the house to ask for sewing—that she</p>
<p class="p1">took in sewing for a living—that she lodged at the cabinet-maker’s, over</p>
<p class="p1">the way—and that she had a little girl almost two years old, who was no</p>
<p class="p1">doubt at the cabinet-maker’s now, which she supposed was what had made</p>
<p class="p1">the mother look around, and inquire so anxiously.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">The woman’s story was scarcely over before Captain Fairfax seized his</p>
<p class="p1">hat, and hurried from the room. As soon as he was gone, Mrs. Fairfax</p>
<p class="p1">called the woman up before her, and said—</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Nelly, you heard your master tell me of his marriage with this young</p>
<p class="p1">lady?”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Yes, madam.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“I need not tell you that it is my will that there be no kitchen gossip</p>
<p class="p1">about this matter. This young lady—once Miss Zuleime Clifton, is now,</p>
<p class="p1">and has been for nearly three years past, Mrs. Francis Fairfax, the wife</p>
<p class="p1">of my son, and is also your own young mistress. You understand?”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Yes, madam.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Then let there be no idle conversation about this marriage, if you</p>
<p class="p1">would avoid my severest displeasure.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Farther colloquy was arrested by the hurried entrance of Captain</p>
<p class="p1">Fairfax, bringing his little wee girl in his arms. Mrs. Fairfax</p>
<p class="p1">immediately arose to take her from him, but the child’s quick eyes had</p>
<p class="p1">recognized her mother lying on the bed, and she began to clap her hands</p>
<p class="p1">and call—</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Mamma! mamma!”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Frank held her closely, and tried to still her joyful, eager cries, but</p>
<p class="p1">the magical sound of her child’s voice had already awakened the sleeper,</p>
<p class="p1">and she opened her eyes, and seeing the babe in its father’s arms,</p>
<p class="p1">smiled a feeble smile of content, and fell away again into oblivion.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Mrs. Fairfax had the doctor summoned again, and told him that if he</p>
<p class="p1">wished to see her daughter-in-law awake, he must remain at her bedside,</p>
<p class="p1">for that she only awoke to relapse instantly into slumber.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">The physician then took his seat by the bedside of his patient, and</p>
<p class="p1">requested all except a maid-servant to leave the chamber.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Mrs. Fairfax and Frank went out, taking the little girl with them, and</p>
<p class="p1">leaving the doctor with the invalid.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">After the lapse of an hour, the physician came out and went down stairs.</p>
<p class="p1">Captain Fairfax was waiting for him in the hall, and drew him into the</p>
<p class="p1">parlor, anxiously requesting to know his opinion. Perhaps he was really</p>
<p class="p1">sanguine, and hoped the doctor’s verdict might set his fears at rest. At</p>
<p class="p1">any rate he insisted upon knowing the precise state of the case. The</p>
<p class="p1">doctor gravely motioned him to sit down, and then took a seat himself.</p>
<p class="p1">He said that his patient was not sinking so much under any local disease</p>
<p class="p1">as under a general atrophy, for which, considering _the circumstances_,</p>
<p class="p1">he could not possibly account—_for_, if he had met precisely such a case</p>
<p class="p1">in the very lowest walks of life, he should at once have declared that</p>
<p class="p1">the patient had been brought to this state by the want of proper and</p>
<p class="p1">sufficient food—that, in short, she was dying of a slow starvation. A</p>
<p class="p1">deep groan broke from the lips of Francis Fairfax, and he started up,</p>
<p class="p1">covered his face with his hands, and walked the floor in rapid strides.</p>
<p class="p1">Suddenly he stopped before the physician, with a countenance convulsed</p>
<p class="p1">with grief and remorse, with all pride and hesitation gone, and</p>
<p class="p1">exclaimed, in thrilling tones—</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Doctor! suppose her case—my wife’s case had been as you would have</p>
<p class="p1">surmised, finding it any where else!—suppose that for months past she</p>
<p class="p1">has been starving—Great God—_starving_!—Now that the cause of this utter</p>
<p class="p1">failure of the vital powers is removed—now that she has every thing that</p>
<p class="p1">wealth, that the most devoted affection can give her, may she not</p>
<p class="p1">recruit and live? Oh! tell me?”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">The physician answered sternly—</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“I do not know, sir! This tampering with the laws of life—this pursuing</p>
<p class="p1">it to the very edge of death is not safe. Is she inclined to take food</p>
<p class="p1">at all?”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“No—only a little gruel, and that mechanically, without appetite.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Exactly—a few days fasting makes one ravenous, but a long, partial</p>
<p class="p1">starvation so exhausts the victim, that he loses all inclination for</p>
<p class="p1">food, as well as all power to assimilate it.” The doctor spoke severely.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Sir! I forgive your sternness and your evident suspicions, perhaps they</p>
<p class="p1">are partially just. If they were otherwise, God knows I am so stricken</p>
<p class="p1">that I have scarcely manhood enough left to resent them—but oh! tell</p>
<p class="p1">me—do not evade the question. Can she be restored? and how?”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Captain Fairfax, I told you that she was sinking, not so much under any</p>
<p class="p1">local disorder as under general atrophy—and yet she _has_ a local</p>
<p class="p1">disease superinduced by this same slow starvation. Upon examination by</p>
<p class="p1">the stethoscope, I find tubercles forming upon the left lung. There is</p>
<p class="p1">also morbid action of the heart. You know how it is with phthisis! With</p>
<p class="p1">proper care, and under favorable circumstances, the patient may live for</p>
<p class="p1">years, perhaps for many years, and die at length in old age of something</p>
<p class="p1">else.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Oh, _no_ care, _no_ pains—nothing that money—nothing that love can do,</p>
<p class="p1">shall be wanting! There is hope?”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“I dare not say there is _much_ hope in this instance. This atrophy is a</p>
<p class="p1">very unfavorable thing—all our hope is in being able to save the</p>
<p class="p1">digestive functions. I have left a prescription, with written</p>
<p class="p1">directions, above stairs.” The doctor took his hat, and saying that he</p>
<p class="p1">would see the invalid again in the afternoon, departed.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“All alike! all alike! They sway from right to left, raising one’s</p>
<p class="p1">hopes, and then rousing their fears! He lies! he lies! It is not so! she</p>
<p class="p1">is in no danger! Great God she must not die! she shall not!” So</p>
<p class="p1">unjustly, wildly, sinfully Frank Fairfax talked, walking distractedly up</p>
<p class="p1">and down the floor, convulsed by grief, remorse and fear for her he</p>
<p class="p1">loved so strongly, and felt he had wronged so greatly. He dared not seek</p>
<p class="p1">her bedside now in his excited state—he rushed into his library, locked</p>
<p class="p1">the door, and gave himself up to all the power of remorse.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">In the afternoon he sought the sick room again. And the deep, sweet</p>
<p class="p1">peace that pervaded the apartment fell like a soothing spell upon his</p>
<p class="p1">excited nerves. The front windows were open, for the day was very fine,</p>
<p class="p1">and the fresh air and the sunshine came in together, with the cheerful</p>
<p class="p1">view of the expanse of water, and the wooded hills across James River.</p>
<p class="p1">The coolness of the air was sufficiently tempered by a glowing coal fire</p>
<p class="p1">in the grate. Zuleime lay raised up with pillows on the bed, and upon</p>
<p class="p1">the counterpane by her sat her little girl. The face of the youthful</p>
<p class="p1">mother seemed as soft, as feeble, and as free of care and sorrow as that</p>
<p class="p1">of the infant herself. On seeing Frank enter, she smiled a gentle,</p>
<p class="p1">pleased, childish smile, and feebly moved her hand towards him. He went</p>
<p class="p1">to her, at first successfully repressing all his strong emotions, and</p>
<p class="p1">kissed her very gently, but then sank upon his knees, and dropping his</p>
<p class="p1">face upon her hand, burst into tears, and wept passionately. Her other</p>
<p class="p1">hand wandered playfully through his curls, and she said, gently—</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Don’t weep, Frank, please don’t—indeed I am happy—it is so nice to be</p>
<p class="p1">here—don’t weep.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">But when men weep and sob, it is no passing shower, like the easily shed</p>
<p class="p1">tears of women, but a great gust, shaking all the nature. So it was a</p>
<p class="p1">long time before Frank mastered his emotion. When he recovered his</p>
<p class="p1">composure, and arose and sat by her side and looked at her, he found</p>
<p class="p1">that the hectic fever burned crimson on her cheeks, and that her</p>
<p class="p1">brilliant eyes wandered about deliriously. And he knew that he had</p>
<p class="p1">harmed her again. And soon she began to talk at random, babbling</p>
<p class="p1">childishly, delightfully, about White Cliffs, and the forest walks, and</p>
<p class="p1">the garden. And she addressed her father and sister, as if they were</p>
<p class="p1">present. And very lovingly she spoke to Catherine; or, coming nearer to</p>
<p class="p1">the present moment, talked with Ida about her feminine shrinking from</p>
<p class="p1">appearing upon the stage. Frank listened in the deepest trouble, and in</p>
<p class="p1">the wandering of her mind he learned much that had transpired at White</p>
<p class="p1">Cliffs, a great deal that had occurred since her flight thence, and</p>
<p class="p1">_all_ that he ought to have known.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">When the physician arrived in the evening, he instituted strict</p>
<p class="p1">inquiries, and discovered the cause of her high fever. Then he rebuked</p>
<p class="p1">the indiscretion of her friends, and leaving fresh prescriptions, with</p>
<p class="p1">peremptory orders that the deepest quiet should be preserved, departed.</p>
<p class="p1">Her fever unabated raged all night. In the morning it went off.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Captain Fairfax would not permit himself to enter her room again until</p>
<p class="p1">he had obtained the power of perfect self-control. At about eleven</p>
<p class="p1">o’clock he went in. The crimson curtains of the windows were drawn</p>
<p class="p1">aside, and the room was light and cheerful. The white muslin drapery of</p>
<p class="p1">the bedstead was festooned, and revealed the fair invalid reclining</p>
<p class="p1">there, wan, placid, child-like as ever. She welcomed her husband with</p>
<p class="p1">the same soft, faint smile. And he went and sat by her side, and</p>
<p class="p1">crushing down all strong emotions, took her hand, and spoke to her</p>
<p class="p1">calmly and pleasantly, inquiring how she felt.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“So well—it is so nice to be here,” she answered simply. And she lay</p>
<p class="p1">there looking at him contentedly, smiling softly, answering vaguely when</p>
<p class="p1">he spoke to her; but never asking any question; or making any comment;</p>
<p class="p1">or volunteering any speech whatever. This pained him more than all—for</p>
<p class="p1">he knew that mind as well as body was sinking—lapsing away into a sort</p>
<p class="p1">of dreamy, happy fatuity. And all attempts to rouse her from that state</p>
<p class="p1">only threw her into fever, and often into delirium.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">One day, with a view to interest without exciting her, he inquired—</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Dearest, is there any one you would like to see?”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Yes—Ida,” she said.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“And who is Ida, love?” asked Frank, very cautiously and gently, for he</p>
<p class="p1">felt as if he were running the risk of hurting her again.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Ida! La! don’t you know? She was so good to me,” she replied, with a</p>
<p class="p1">pitying smile.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Captain Fairfax left the room, and at a venture went over to inquire at</p>
<p class="p1">the cabinet-maker’s. And he soon returned, accompanied by Mrs. Knight.</p>
<p class="p1">Zuleime received her visitor without any emotion whatever; smiling</p>
<p class="p1">gently, and holding out her hand, and afterwards lying and silently and</p>
<p class="p1">pleasantly watching her as she sat by the bed. And when she arose to</p>
<p class="p1">leave, she put up her lips for a kiss. Poor Ida pressed those lips very</p>
<p class="p1">gently, and then quietly left the room: but as soon as she had passed</p>
<p class="p1">the door, burst into tears.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Every day Zuleime’s mind flowed away. Every day she became more</p>
<p class="p1">infantile in weakness and simplicity. One day she made known a wish—the</p>
<p class="p1">only one she had ever voluntarily expressed. It was affecting from its</p>
<p class="p1">utter childishness.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Dear Frank, you and your mother are rich. I want you to bring Ida and</p>
<p class="p1">her child home to live here, so that she may not have to go on the stage</p>
<p class="p1">any more.” She reverted to this subject so frequently, repeating this,</p>
<p class="p1">the only wish she had ever expressed, so often and earnestly, that her</p>
<p class="p1">husband felt strongly inclined to gratify her desire, strange as it</p>
<p class="p1">really was. He consulted his mother, and they concluded that it might be</p>
<p class="p1">done, in a measure. Then they told her that it should be as she wished;</p>
<p class="p1">that Ida and her child should come and live with them, if she would.</p>
<p class="p1">Captain Fairfax went again to the cabinet-maker’s, saw the poor actress,</p>
<p class="p1">and told her that his wife needed a female companion to sit with her a</p>
<p class="p1">portion of the day, and that she would hear of no one for the post but</p>
<p class="p1">her old friend, Mrs. Knight, if Mrs. Knight would come and name her own</p>
<p class="p1">salary. And when he had let slip that last word, he turned away his face</p>
<p class="p1">with his forehead burning under the astonished, indignant gaze of those</p>
<p class="p1">proud, dark eyes of Ida’s, as she said—</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Captain Fairfax, I receive a ‘salary’ in the regular line of my</p>
<p class="p1">profession, when I am engaged in it; as Captain Fairfax also receives</p>
<p class="p1">pay for his military services—but as he would spurn all offers of</p>
<p class="p1">pecuniary remuneration for attentions to a wounded comrade, so should I</p>
<p class="p1">decline all compensation for attentions to a sick neighbor; and I am</p>
<p class="p1">most surprised that you should have made such a proposal to me.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">So was Captain Fairfax himself really surprised that he should have been</p>
<p class="p1">betrayed into such an error, as to forget that the very profession of</p>
<p class="p1">the poor tragic actress really fostered a morbid pride. Her phrases</p>
<p class="p1">might have been a little stilted after the manner of the stage, but the</p>
<p class="p1">sentiments were really true and high, and worthy of all consideration.</p>
<p class="p1">So Captain Fairfax apologized, as he best could, and arose to take his</p>
<p class="p1">leave. Then she said—</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Do not quite misunderstand me. I am very anxious to do all in my power</p>
<p class="p1">to serve Mrs. Fairfax, for I love her dearly! I am willing to devote all</p>
<p class="p1">my time, night and day, to her service, for the affection I bear her.</p>
<p class="p1">And I can do it now; for since the burning of the theatre I have been</p>
<p class="p1">disengaged.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Captain Fairfax replied by expressing his grateful acknowledgments of</p>
<p class="p1">her kindness, and begging her to come over frequently to see his wife.</p>
<p class="p1">Then he took leave indeed and returned home, with the determination to</p>
<p class="p1">ask his mother to go and invite Mrs. Knight to come and spend a few</p>
<p class="p1">weeks with her friend at Fairview House. Old Mrs. Fairfax had quite a</p>
<p class="p1">struggle with her Virginian pride and prejudices, before she could make</p>
<p class="p1">up her mind to ask an actress to become her guest, but benevolence</p>
<p class="p1">conquered, and as whatever she once resolved upon doing she did</p>
<p class="p1">graciously and gracefully, she called upon Mrs. Knight, and gave her the</p>
<p class="p1">invitation in a manner that insured its acceptance. Ida, with her little</p>
<p class="p1">girl, came over the next day. And the old lady felt fully rewarded for</p>
<p class="p1">her self-conquest, when she saw the smile of childish delight with which</p>
<p class="p1">the gentle patient greeted her poor friend.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“See, Ida,” murmured Zuleime, as her visitor seated herself at the</p>
<p class="p1">bedside, “see, Ida, we are both now in the nice house we used to look at</p>
<p class="p1">so longingly from our poor, back windows.” She paused from weakness, and</p>
<p class="p1">then said, “I used to call it my _Heaven_, you know! Ah, I did not know</p>
<p class="p1">it was really _my_ Heaven. I did not know Frank had ever lived here—how</p>
<p class="p1">strange!” She paused again, but this time from thought, as well as from</p>
<p class="p1">exhaustion, and then she took breath and said again, “I never could make</p>
<p class="p1">it out clearly and it makes my head ache to try. But see, dear Ida. Look</p>
<p class="p1">at the crimson window-curtains—don’t you know they are the very same</p>
<p class="p1">crimson curtains that used to throw the warm, red glow across the snow,</p>
<p class="p1">when we used to sit at the back window and watch them, and almost envy</p>
<p class="p1">the people that lived here?”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Yes, I know, but do not talk too much, darling.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“I won’t—but it is so strange. There, look through the windows, you can</p>
<p class="p1">see our little, narrow, pinched, back windows, with their check</p>
<p class="p1">curtains, as plainly from here, as we used to see these from there. We</p>
<p class="p1">did not think we should ever get here to live, did we?—how strange!”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Her talk, rambling as it was, revealed one hopeful fact—that her mind</p>
<p class="p1">was at length waking up. Frank saw it with joy. Day by day, from this</p>
<p class="p1">time, her intellect seemed to clear and strengthen. Frank spoke of this</p>
<p class="p1">to the doctor, who heard him with great gravity, and without comment.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">As winter advanced towards spring, her mind “brightened more and more</p>
<p class="p1">towards the perfect day.” She had gleaned, partly from scraps of speech</p>
<p class="p1">carelessly dropped, and partly by inquiry, the history of Frank’s</p>
<p class="p1">captivity among the Shoshonowas, that first originated the report of his</p>
<p class="p1">death—and she was very gradually brought to understand the true position</p>
<p class="p1">of affairs—so gradually through so many weeks, that the knowledge may be</p>
<p class="p1">said rather to have slowly grown upon her. But as her mind cleared and</p>
<p class="p1">strengthened, her heart became saddened and depressed. She understood</p>
<p class="p1">too much now for her happiness. She no longer lay and watched her</p>
<p class="p1">husband with a delighted smile as he sat beside her bed—no, but rather</p>
<p class="p1">with a look of earnest, mournful love. Well she might. Frank was sad</p>
<p class="p1">enough—he thought his heart was breaking.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">One day, while lying propped up by pillows, she heard the name of Mrs.</p>
<p class="p1">Georgia Clifton mentioned.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Is she in the city?” inquired she.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Yes, love,” replied her husband.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Send for her to come and see me—I _must_ see her.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Captain Fairfax arose and left the room immediately, and instead of</p>
<p class="p1">sending a servant, went himself to bring Mrs. Georgia. For so great was</p>
<p class="p1">his desire to gratify promptly every wish of his loved one’s heart, that</p>
<p class="p1">he seldom trusted the execution of them to any but himself, lest they</p>
<p class="p1">should fail or be delayed. It was well in this instance, at least, that</p>
<p class="p1">he went in person. A servant could not have effected the purpose. The</p>
<p class="p1">conscience-stricken Georgia would not have ventured to come. Even when</p>
<p class="p1">unannounced, by reason of his haste, Captain Fairfax entered her parlor,</p>
<p class="p1">the beauty turned deadly pale, under the fear of detected guilt. But</p>
<p class="p1">when she saw his calm, kind manner, and heard him entreat, as a favor,</p>
<p class="p1">that she would put on her bonnet immediately, and return with him to see</p>
<p class="p1">his wife, who was extremely ill at Fairview, the sorceress was</p>
<p class="p1">reassured, and with her usual bewitching grace consented to accompany</p>
<p class="p1">him.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">When they arrived at Fairview House, and were shown up into the sick</p>
<p class="p1">chamber, the patient smiled and held out her hands. Georgia hastened</p>
<p class="p1">towards her, and seized both hands, covering them with kisses, and</p>
<p class="p1">making a show of great emotion. Zuleime raised her feeble voice, and</p>
<p class="p1">begged all to go out of the room, and leave her alone with her visitor.</p>
<p class="p1">And when every one had departed, and the door was closed, she said—</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Sit down, please, here by my bedside.” Mrs. Georgia took the nurse’s</p>
<p class="p1">arm-chair. “Dear Georgia,” she said, gently taking both her hands, and</p>
<p class="p1">looking kindly in her face, “I sent for you, because I thought you must</p>
<p class="p1">be so unhappy about what you have unintentionally caused me to suffer.</p>
<p class="p1">And I wished to tell you not to remember it in bitterness any more. Oh!</p>
<p class="p1">I grieve so much at the memory of what I have made my dear father</p>
<p class="p1">suffer, that I can feel for others who are tortured by remorse, and I</p>
<p class="p1">would not, for the whole world, that any one should mourn for what they</p>
<p class="p1">have caused me to suffer. So, dear Georgia, I acquit you of all blame,</p>
<p class="p1">from the bottom of my heart, indeed I do—and I pray that God may make</p>
<p class="p1">you happier than _I_ have ever been. And I will never, never drop a</p>
<p class="p1">hint, by which any one shall suspect—I mean I will never let fall a word</p>
<p class="p1">to any one, that shall injure you, Georgia. I would not die and bequeath</p>
<p class="p1">you so bitter a legacy as an enemy. Though I knew you would not come and</p>
<p class="p1">ask me, I sent for you to assure you of this, Georgia, and to reconcile</p>
<p class="p1">myself with you, that we might be friends before I die. And now, God</p>
<p class="p1">bless you! Kiss me, and say good-bye, for my fever is rising.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">And she held up her lips. Georgia was weeping.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Zuleime, my dear child, why don’t you call me mamma, as heretofore?”</p>
<p class="p1">she asked.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Oh, don’t you know long ago you told me not to do it. But I will, if</p>
<p class="p1">you wish it, now. Kiss me, dear mamma. There, now, go and be at peace.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Georgia hurried from the room. They never met again.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Zuleime revived slightly when the spring opened. She had heard that her</p>
<p class="p1">sister Carolyn had nearly recovered her health, and was just about to</p>
<p class="p1">set out on her voyage home. And two secret wishes the poor girl</p>
<p class="p1">indulged: once more to visit White Cliffs, and to live to see her only</p>
<p class="p1">sister again. But she kept them to herself in the fear of giving Frank</p>
<p class="p1">trouble, for she knew that he would try to move Heaven and earth to</p>
<p class="p1">please her, and deeply grieve if he should fail. She concealed her</p>
<p class="p1">wants, but they were discovered by him who watched day and night to</p>
<p class="p1">anticipate her wishes. And Captain Fairfax called upon the family</p>
<p class="p1">physician, and consulted him upon the possibility of taking Zuleime to</p>
<p class="p1">White Cliffs, as soon as the spring weather should be permanently</p>
<p class="p1">settled. The physician’s opinion was highly favorable to his wishes. He</p>
<p class="p1">said that she might be removed by easy stages to the country, and that</p>
<p class="p1">if proper care and attention were bestowed, the journey and the change</p>
<p class="p1">of air would probably be found very beneficial to her health. Captain</p>
<p class="p1">Fairfax hastened home to cheer his wife with the news. And she was</p>
<p class="p1">gladdened by it. She caught both his hands and kissed them, and held</p>
<p class="p1">them to her face, and looking at him fondly, said—</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Dear Frank! dearest Frank! you try to perform miracles for me!”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">The same night, Captain Fairfax wrote to Mrs. Clifton, of Hardbargain,</p>
<p class="p1">to go over to White Cliffs and prepare to receive the invalid. And from</p>
<p class="p1">that day Zuleime revived, and by the first of June was so much better,</p>
<p class="p1">as to be able to be placed in the comfortable family carriage, in which,</p>
<p class="p1">sometimes reclining upon downy cushions, sometimes resting upon the</p>
<p class="p1">bosom of her husband, and supported by his arms, she traveled by easy</p>
<p class="p1">stages to White Cliffs. They reached the end of their journey upon the</p>
<p class="p1">afternoon of the third day. Mrs. Clifton and Catherine were there to</p>
<p class="p1">receive them. Zuleime was lifted out of the carriage, very much</p>
<p class="p1">exhausted. Yet, as she was gently carried through the yard, her eyes</p>
<p class="p1">roved gladly over all the dear familiar scene—over mountains, fields and</p>
<p class="p1">forests, clothed now in the luxuriant foliage of June—and all her</p>
<p class="p1">countenance lighted up with joy, and she exclaimed many times in tones</p>
<p class="p1">of profound gratitude—</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Thank God! oh, thank God!”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">She was carried up stairs, and put to bed at once. And Catherine was</p>
<p class="p1">stationed to watch her slumbers, while Mrs. Clifton remained below to</p>
<p class="p1">attend to the comfort of the tired travelers. But Zuleime frequently</p>
<p class="p1">awoke with a joyful start and recollection; and once she put her hand in</p>
<p class="p1">that of Kate, and said—</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Dear Kate! blessed Kate! I am so glad to see you again! And so very</p>
<p class="p1">glad to be _home_ again! Sweet Sister of Mercy! will you stay and nurse</p>
<p class="p1">_me_ also? I think you could almost cure me! Sweet, unprofessed nun,</p>
<p class="p1">will you stay and nurse me, too?”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Yes, dear Zuleime, I will stay as long as you want me. But shut those</p>
<p class="p1">tired eyes, love, and go to sleep.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Yes, seal each eyelid down with a kiss, dear Kate, and then they will</p>
<p class="p1">stay closed. And hold my hand as I go to sleep—I feel so safe when some</p>
<p class="p1">one I love holds my hand while I slumber. I feel as if they could keep</p>
<p class="p1">me in life while I slept, for you must know, dear Kate, that my heart</p>
<p class="p1">has a morbid action, and some of these days I shall fall asleep lightly</p>
<p class="p1">as now, but never awake again.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Dear Zuleime, you must not indulge such fancies.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“They are not fancies, they are realities. I do not deceive myself and</p>
<p class="p1">trifle with you, Kate. Do not you deceive me or trifle with me, either.</p>
<p class="p1">There are secrets of life and death known only to the dying. Such a</p>
<p class="p1">secret is mine. I know that I shall lightly drop asleep some day, and</p>
<p class="p1">never wake again—that is the reason I wish some one I love to kiss my</p>
<p class="p1">eyelids down, and to hold my hand while I slumber.” The words, the</p>
<p class="p1">manner of the dying girl carried deep conviction to the heart of</p>
<p class="p1">Catherine, and—</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Oh! Zuleime,” she said, “lean upon the failing arm of flesh if you</p>
<p class="p1">will, but, oh, seek! seek the support of that Almighty arm that can</p>
<p class="p1">sustain you in life and in death! Seek that!”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“I will—I wish to do it, or rather you, the handmaid of the Lord, shall</p>
<p class="p1">bear me up in your faithful hands, and lay me within that Arm of</p>
<p class="p1">Strength. I wished this long ago, but, oh, my dear husband and his good</p>
<p class="p1">mother! they thought only of restoring me to health, and I could think</p>
<p class="p1">of nothing but of trying to live for them, until very lately, when it</p>
<p class="p1">was revealed to me that I should surely die. I have never yet told Frank</p>
<p class="p1">anything about this. I feared it would distress him too much; but the</p>
<p class="p1">lone knowledge troubled me. I needed to tell some one of it, some dear</p>
<p class="p1">one with whom I could converse confidentially, and who should be wise</p>
<p class="p1">enough to counsel me, patient enough to bear with me, courageous enough</p>
<p class="p1">to face the result, and who, besides, would not be too greatly</p>
<p class="p1">distressed, as my dear husband would. And so, sweet Kate, I have told</p>
<p class="p1">you. Will you now stay with me and nurse me?”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Yes, dear Zuleime, as long as you wish me to do so; but now, darling,</p>
<p class="p1">if I am to be your nurse, you must mind what I have to say to you, and</p>
<p class="p1">go to sleep.” Catherine bent over her, and kissed her eyelids down upon</p>
<p class="p1">the weary eyes, and held her hand until she fell asleep. At night,</p>
<p class="p1">Captain Fairfax relieved her watch.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">The next morning when Catherine entered the room she sat down by the</p>
<p class="p1">side of the bed, and told her that she had good news to tell, that they</p>
<p class="p1">had received a letter from Major Clifton, that Carolyn’s health was</p>
<p class="p1">improving, and that they had embarked, or had purposed to embark upon</p>
<p class="p1">the first of May, and expected to reach home as soon as the middle of</p>
<p class="p1">June. Zuleime clasped her hands in fervent thanksgiving while she</p>
<p class="p1">listened, and when her friend ceased to speak, she exclaimed—</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“In two weeks she will be here—oh! that I may live to see it!”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Kate bade her be of good cheer and hope; and when Catherine told any one</p>
<p class="p1">to hope, her words and looks and manner all inspired the feeling.</p>
<p class="p1">Zuleime was so recovered and enlivened as to be able to be lifted from</p>
<p class="p1">her bed and placed in the easy-chair by the open window, that looked out</p>
<p class="p1">upon the mountain scenery, all glorious in the light of summer morning.</p>
<p class="p1">Old Mrs. Fairfax, and Mrs. Clifton of Hardbargain, came in to pay her a</p>
<p class="p1">visit, bringing her little girl with them. As for Captain Fairfax, he</p>
<p class="p1">seldom left her side. All congratulated the invalid upon her improved</p>
<p class="p1">health and spirits, and hoped and foretold great results from her</p>
<p class="p1">residence in the country, and projected many pleasant drives, when she</p>
<p class="p1">should be a little rested from the fatigue of her journey. Then they</p>
<p class="p1">talked of Major Clifton and Carolyn’s expected arrival, and laid out</p>
<p class="p1">extensive plans of amusement to be put in execution when they should</p>
<p class="p1">come, by which time Zuleime also would be considerably restored. Thus</p>
<p class="p1">cheerfully, hopefully they talked. And the dying one listened sweetly;</p>
<p class="p1">but when she found herself alone again with Kate, she said—</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“I let them talk, Catherine, for if they _really_ have any hopes of my</p>
<p class="p1">recovery, I do not wish to destroy those hopes by telling what I know,</p>
<p class="p1">and if they only talk so to cheer me, why even then I do not like to</p>
<p class="p1">make them sad by not seeming to believe them. And yet, and yet, perhaps</p>
<p class="p1">I ought to tell Frank; perhaps I will!”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Catherine devoted herself to the service of the invalid, laboring</p>
<p class="p1">zealously for her spiritual as for her bodily good, indeed, the girl</p>
<p class="p1">glided into the performance of such duties as naturally as if she felt</p>
<p class="p1">herself especially called to the work, born for the work. The selfish</p>
<p class="p1">wish for her own comfort and pleasure had never been very strong in the</p>
<p class="p1">heart of Catherine; and within the last two years it seemed to have</p>
<p class="p1">expired. She lived only for the good of others. She had grown to believe</p>
<p class="p1">that there was no individual happiness for herself, except in the</p>
<p class="p1">service of others. Young hope had died out in her heart, she was</p>
<p class="p1">resigned. She adopted the submissive words of Mary and her Son, and</p>
<p class="p1">said, within her heart, in deepest sincerity—</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Behold, the handmaid of the Lord.” “Not my will, but Thine, oh God.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Zuleime was lifted from the bed to the easy-chair every morning, and</p>
<p class="p1">calmly and profoundly the invalid enjoyed those glorious summer</p>
<p class="p1">mornings. But she was failing very fast. She grew very anxious for the</p>
<p class="p1">coming of her sister; but, unwilling to disturb any one by her anxiety,</p>
<p class="p1">she confided it only to Kate. They had not heard from Major Clifton</p>
<p class="p1">since the letter announcing his expected embarkation. They justly</p>
<p class="p1">supposed him to be on his voyage home, accompanied by Carolyn, and were</p>
<p class="p1">now daily looking for a letter announcing their landing, and their</p>
<p class="p1">speedy arrival home. The middle of June passed, and no letter had come.</p>
<p class="p1">The first of July arrived, but brought no news of the voyagers.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Oh, if they had come when they promised, they might have seen me before</p>
<p class="p1">I died—but I cannot hold out much longer, Kate. I feel as if the longing</p>
<p class="p1">to meet Carolyn again had kept me up as by the excitement of</p>
<p class="p1">expectation, but, Kate, I feel very weary, very much inclined to droop,</p>
<p class="p1">yet know if I should give way I should drop into the arms of Death. I</p>
<p class="p1">wish they would come. I want to see Carolyn. I want to see her happiness</p>
<p class="p1">with my own eyes. And then it is not for myself—for if I die before she</p>
<p class="p1">comes, Carolyn will take it very much to heart to know that her poor</p>
<p class="p1">little sister had been found and had died—so inopportunely, just before</p>
<p class="p1">she had got home. I wish they would come.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">The second week in July arrived—with three days of cloud, and rain, and</p>
<p class="p1">gloom. Zuleime could not leave her bed for her favorite seat at the</p>
<p class="p1">window, but Catherine served her with more love and zeal than ever. The</p>
<p class="p1">family had as yet received no news of the travelers, and though they</p>
<p class="p1">daily grew more anxious, there was no foreboding in their anxiety.</p>
<p class="p1">Sea-voyages at that day were of such uncertain length. All was no doubt</p>
<p class="p1">well.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">But on the evening of the second rainy day, while Captain Fairfax and</p>
<p class="p1">Catherine sat with Zuleime, and all the other members of the family were</p>
<p class="p1">assembled in the summer saloon, the door of the latter was quietly</p>
<p class="p1">opened, and Major Clifton stood before the astonished circle. His mother</p>
<p class="p1">advanced to meet and welcome him. Then she noticed—and they all noticed,</p>
<p class="p1">that he was clothed in deep mourning. That told the tale! They welcomed</p>
<p class="p1">him with affectionate sympathy, but no one asked a question. Nor did he</p>
<p class="p1">as yet volunteer a word of his sorrow’s history. It was only the next</p>
<p class="p1">day that his mother learned from him how deceptive was the seeming</p>
<p class="p1">convalescence of his wife—how from the day of their embarkation her</p>
<p class="p1">strength declined—how for weeks their hearts fluctuated between hope and</p>
<p class="p1">fear, as with the changes of her flattering disease she seemed better or</p>
<p class="p1">worse—how when all thought of life was gone, but one earthly hope</p>
<p class="p1">possessed her soul—to die _at home_;—of the waning of that last hope—of</p>
<p class="p1">the death at sea—and, finally, of the lone grave in the ocean isle,</p>
<p class="p1">where slept the mortal remains of the haughtiest beauty that ever trod</p>
<p class="p1">the halls of a palace.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">They would willingly have concealed the fact of her sister’s decease</p>
<p class="p1">from the dying girl—no one ventured to tell her of the event—they fondly</p>
<p class="p1">believed that she remained in ignorance of it. But she knew it all from</p>
<p class="p1">what she saw and heard. She knew that Major Clifton had returned alone,</p>
<p class="p1">and she surmised the rest from the sad and tearful faces of all around</p>
<p class="p1">her. Yes, she knew it all, as well as any could have made her know it,</p>
<p class="p1">and in the tender thoughtfulness of her soul, she would not distress any</p>
<p class="p1">by asking them questions relating to the last moment. But from this hour</p>
<p class="p1">she sank rapidly. She could no longer be lifted from her bed without</p>
<p class="p1">fainting. In deep trouble, Captain Fairfax summoned the old family</p>
<p class="p1">physician. When he came, and saw the patient, his opinion was decidedly</p>
<p class="p1">formed, and truthfully given—he said that the Richmond physician had</p>
<p class="p1">evidently abandoned the case as hopeless, when he sent her home to</p>
<p class="p1">die—that her life had probably been prolonged by her residence in the</p>
<p class="p1">country—but that nothing could have saved her—and that she had now not</p>
<p class="p1">many days to live. Captain Fairfax was almost mad with grief—and all the</p>
<p class="p1">self-possession and self-control that he had learned in the long</p>
<p class="p1">attendance upon her sick bed well nigh deserted him. It was many hours</p>
<p class="p1">before he was sufficiently composed to take his usual place by her</p>
<p class="p1">bedside, and then his agonized countenance betrayed the extent of his</p>
<p class="p1">suffering. Catherine was sitting by her when he entered. Zuleime raised</p>
<p class="p1">her dying eyes, and looking at him, tenderly beckoned him to approach.</p>
<p class="p1">Then she motioned Catherine to leave her. When they were alone—she laid</p>
<p class="p1">her hand within his own, and looking at him with unutterable love, said—</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Dear Frank—dearest Frank—I see that you know it all at last. Dearest</p>
<p class="p1">Frank, I have known it a long time. Now let us talk freely and</p>
<p class="p1">confidentially about it—let there be no more of that painful mist</p>
<p class="p1">between us as when you thought only of my restoration to health, and I</p>
<p class="p1">knew I was sinking fast into the grave.” She paused a moment, and then</p>
<p class="p1">said—“I want so much to comfort you. I have something to say to you.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">His fingers closed upon her hand convulsively. He choked down his</p>
<p class="p1">strong, rising emotion, and said—</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Do not try to talk, love, the effort will exhaust your strength.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“No—no, it will not. I am not so weak as I was when you came in. Dearest</p>
<p class="p1">Frank, when you sit by me, and hold my hand, new life seems to run up my</p>
<p class="p1">feeble veins, and I feel stronger. Let me talk, love. Ah! do not look so</p>
<p class="p1">sad! It is better as it is, love. It is better I should go. I have</p>
<p class="p1">spoiled my own life, and should spoil yours if I should live. Ah, it is</p>
<p class="p1">a dreadful thing to occasion the death of any one! it is an awful thing</p>
<p class="p1">to cause the death of a father. I caused the death of the most loving</p>
<p class="p1">father that ever lived. And dearest Frank! though in the struggle, in</p>
<p class="p1">the bitterness of poverty, in the pangs of hunger and of cold, and in</p>
<p class="p1">the pain and debility of illness, the feeling of compunction has been</p>
<p class="p1">diverted, yet—had health returned with prosperity—remorse would then</p>
<p class="p1">have darkened all my life; and in ruining my happiness, would have</p>
<p class="p1">marred yours. Yes! I have spoiled my own life. It is well that I should</p>
<p class="p1">not live to spoil yours, dearest Frank! I talk not of expiation _now_.</p>
<p class="p1">Nothing that I could do or suffer, would alter the irrevocable past. We</p>
<p class="p1">have all one Redeemer—Jesus Christ the Righteous. So I talk not of</p>
<p class="p1">expiating the past; though perhaps if any heart is hardened against me,</p>
<p class="p1">my early death may soften it. But, let me speak of the future—_your_</p>
<p class="p1">future, dearest Frank, and let me say it is better for all your coming</p>
<p class="p1">years that I should die.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Oh, do not say so, Zuleime—you break my heart.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Dear Frank, you will grieve for me, I know you will, but be comforted.</p>
<p class="p1">You are so young yet. This sorrow will pass like a morning cloud, and</p>
<p class="p1">leave all your life a long bright day.” She paused abruptly—a gray</p>
<p class="p1">shadow swept darkly over her face and vanished. _He_ did not see it, his</p>
<p class="p1">face was buried in his hands. Then she asked to have her child brought</p>
<p class="p1">to her. Frank went out, but soon returned to say that little Fan had</p>
<p class="p1">been put to bed; and to ask her if the child should be waked up. “No, do</p>
<p class="p1">not wake the poor, little thing,” she said, and then added, “I am very,</p>
<p class="p1">very sleepy, Frank; dearest Frank, kiss my eyelids down to slumber like</p>
<p class="p1">you always do, and hold my hand till I fall asleep. Kiss my lips, too,</p>
<p class="p1">this time; kiss them last of all—there—good-night, love.” Her voice sank</p>
<p class="p1">away in a low, inaudible murmur, like a dying sound on the Eolian harp.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Her husband sat and held her hand, never moving, scarcely breathing,</p>
<p class="p1">lest he should disturb her long, deep sleep. He sat there more than an</p>
<p class="p1">hour. The room grew dark with the shades of evening; and when at length</p>
<p class="p1">Catherine entered with the night lamp, he raised his hand with a sign of</p>
<p class="p1">silence and caution, murmuring—</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“She has fallen asleep.” Catherine approached quietly, shading the lamp</p>
<p class="p1">with her hand, and looked upon the sleeper. “Hush, be very cautious—do</p>
<p class="p1">not disturb her,” whispered Frank.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">The sweet and solemn voice of Catherine gently arose, saying, “Come</p>
<p class="p1">away, Captain Fairfax. Nothing will ever disturb her more. She has</p>
<p class="p1">fallen asleep in Jesus.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>

<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Two months have passed since the death of the sisters. To the</p>
<p class="p1">consternation of the _haut ton_ of the city, the beautiful Mrs. Clifton</p>
<p class="p1">has left Richmond, and come down to mourn with those that mourn at White</p>
<p class="p1">Cliffs. With an air at once of earnest conviction and graceful</p>
<p class="p1">weariness, she says that it is “All vanity and vexation of spirit,”</p>
<p class="p1">meaning fashionable society, spring traveling, and sight seeing; summers</p>
<p class="p1">at watering places among the mountains, or by the sea-side; winters in</p>
<p class="p1">town, with plays, concerts, balls, dressing, visiting and waltzing;</p>
<p class="p1">autumn parties in the country-houses, with equestrian expeditions,</p>
<p class="p1">sailing excursions, and forest rides and drives, and even the moonlight</p>
<p class="p1">serenades, and “the slight flirtation by the light of the chandelier.”</p>
<p class="p1">Mrs. Georgia speaks the truth. “Vanity” all this undoubtedly is in</p>
<p class="p1">_her_. But _entres nous_, the “vexation of spirit” appertains to certain</p>
<p class="p1">“small” accounts, ranging from fifty to fifteen hundred dollars, and</p>
<p class="p1">sent in by landlords, merchants, jewelers, milliners, etc., people so</p>
<p class="p1">wanting in delicate perception, as not to see that the honor of the</p>
<p class="p1">belle’s custom was quite payment enough in itself for their goods, and</p>
<p class="p1">so utterly destitute of classic lore, and the faculty of distinguishing</p>
<p class="p1">persons, as actually to draw out on a piece of paper a list of items</p>
<p class="p1">opposite to a row of figures, with a sum total at the bottom, and send</p>
<p class="p1">it to a Circe, as if she were a tradesman, and could understand it!</p>
<p class="p1">Charming Georgia did not even try to comprehend such mysterious</p>
<p class="p1">hieroglyphics. She knew, bewitching creature! that “where ignorance is</p>
<p class="p1">bliss, ’tis folly to be wise.” Therefore, to escape duns, to recruit</p>
<p class="p1">health and spirits, and, of all things, to console Major Clifton, she</p>
<p class="p1">has come down to White Cliffs. The beautiful Georgia presented herself</p>
<p class="p1">to the mourning master of White Cliffs in a very deprecating spirit—she</p>
<p class="p1">said that she felt her arrival there at such a moment to be almost an</p>
<p class="p1">intrusion, but that he would excuse it, as she had exhausted money and</p>
<p class="p1">credit, and had no other home.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“You know,” she added, as the tears suffused her large, dark eyes, “I am</p>
<p class="p1">like the unjust steward of the parable, ‘I cannot work—to beg I am</p>
<p class="p1">ashamed.’”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Except instead of being unjust, you suffer from the injustice of</p>
<p class="p1">others,” said Archer Clifton, very gently. He said that he considered</p>
<p class="p1">the entail, which cut off the widow from any share in the landed estate</p>
<p class="p1">of her deceased husband, very unjust and cruel. He knew that his uncle</p>
<p class="p1">had deeply regretted it, and would have left all his personal property</p>
<p class="p1">to her, had it not been swallowed up by debt. He said that he _himself_</p>
<p class="p1">deplored the circumstance, and if it were legally in his power, he would</p>
<p class="p1">divide the land with her, but that he only held it in entail, and as</p>
<p class="p1">entire as it came to him it must be held for his heirs. He added, that</p>
<p class="p1">he considered it his duty to compensate his uncle’s widow for the</p>
<p class="p1">injustice of the law to her, and that the case being so, she would find</p>
<p class="p1">thirty thousand dollars placed to her account in the Bank of Richmond.</p>
<p class="p1">Mrs. Georgia was overcome with emotion at this generosity on the part of</p>
<p class="p1">Major Clifton. She put her handkerchief to her eyes, and arose</p>
<p class="p1">hurriedly, with every mark of extreme agitation, exclaiming—</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“No, no—this is too much! too good! only lend me the shelter of this</p>
<p class="p1">roof—once my home—until I look about me and consider what to do.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">He took her hand, with every demonstration of the tenderest affection</p>
<p class="p1">and respect, and pressed it to his lips, and begged her to consider</p>
<p class="p1">herself as heretofore, mistress of the establishment for as long as she</p>
<p class="p1">wished—for her whole life, if she pleased—and himself only as her</p>
<p class="p1">sometime guest—adding, that it was impossible he should ever bring</p>
<p class="p1">another lady there. She withdrew her handkerchief from her eyes, and</p>
<p class="p1">glancing at him with a countenance eloquent with gratitude, respect, and</p>
<p class="p1">affection, exclaimed—</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“_I_ take a large portion of your personal property, and _I_ turn you</p>
<p class="p1">from your home! Oh! no, no, no, thou thrice noble and generous man, no!</p>
<p class="p1">Not one dollar of that money will I touch, so help me Heaven! And not</p>
<p class="p1">one hour will I stay under this roof, if the master of the house is to</p>
<p class="p1">be only my ‘sometime guest!’ No! I—I—I must go back to the city, and</p>
<p class="p1">give lessons in drawing and painting, as befits the artist’s daughter.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“And as does _not_ befit my uncle’s widow, lady!” said Archer Clifton,</p>
<p class="p1">again taking her hand. “I have considered myself in some sort your</p>
<p class="p1">guardian and protector—if you will admit the claim. Now, listen to me</p>
<p class="p1">calmly, and act reasonably, for we of White Cliffs are not accustomed to</p>
<p class="p1">be opposed by the ladies of our family. Hear me, then: This money, which</p>
<p class="p1">I have placed to your account, is rightfully yours. I will explain. It</p>
<p class="p1">was the fortune of my dearest Carolyn—” here his voice faltered, he</p>
<p class="p1">paused a moment, during which Georgia pressed his hand, and looked in</p>
<p class="p1">his face with an expression of unspeakable sympathy—then he resumed,</p>
<p class="p1">calmly, “Had she died unmarried, and during her father’s lifetime, this</p>
<p class="p1">money would have reverted to him, and he would doubtless have left it to</p>
<p class="p1">you. I only give you that which, but for me, might have reached you more</p>
<p class="p1">directly. And now let that subject rest forever.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Ah, but best and most generous of friends, I drive you from your home</p>
<p class="p1">by staying here! I cannot stay! I must depart!”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“You must not, Mrs. Clifton—this is your proper home, as it is also</p>
<p class="p1">mine. You do not drive me hence—why should you? Could I possibly remain,</p>
<p class="p1">your company would be the dearest solace I could have. No! it is memory</p>
<p class="p1">that drives me hence, sweet friend! I must—I _must_ forget myself in</p>
<p class="p1">distant lands! Forgive me for talking thus—to be quite plain, as soon as</p>
<p class="p1">the intricate affairs of this estate are disentangled, and wound up, I</p>
<p class="p1">design to set out for two or three years of travel; yet I shall not be</p>
<p class="p1">able to get off for several weeks.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Here the conversation ended for the present. Thinking that for the first</p>
<p class="p1">few days, at least, Mrs. Georgia would need a female companion, he got</p>
<p class="p1">in his chaise, and went ever to Hardbargain for Catherine.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Kate is not here,” said Mrs. Clifton, in answer to his inquiries—“do</p>
<p class="p1">you not know that she has been for three weeks at her brother’s cabin,</p>
<p class="p1">nursing his wife through her confinement?”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Major Clifton threw his hat upon the table, and dropped himself into a</p>
<p class="p1">chair, with an air of extreme vexation, saying—</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“It really seems to me that that girl is nurse and servant-in-general to</p>
<p class="p1">the neighborhood! Her brother might easily have found some old woman to</p>
<p class="p1">nurse his wife. I wonder you permit her to be made such a slave of by</p>
<p class="p1">everybody, mother.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“It does her no harm, Archer.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Twelve months since you introduced Catherine into the best society in</p>
<p class="p1">Richmond.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“The richest, you mean—not the best, by a great deal.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“And now you suffer her to throw herself into the most vulgar and</p>
<p class="p1">common! Dear madam, is this right?”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“‘What God hath cleansed, call not thou common, or unclean’—yes! it is</p>
<p class="p1">right! Catherine, a girl of the very humblest birth, with natural talent</p>
<p class="p1">and acquired accomplishments that fit her for any circle—should mix with</p>
<p class="p1">all. And, Archer, what do you mean by ‘vulgar?’ If ignoble minds,</p>
<p class="p1">corrupt hearts, and mean actions constitute vulgarity—then I for one</p>
<p class="p1">have met more vulgar people in so-called high-life than ever I saw in</p>
<p class="p1">low-life!”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“My dear mother, you are a Republican—let us waive this discussion, for</p>
<p class="p1">I dislike to differ from you, and tell me where I shall find Catherine,</p>
<p class="p1">for she positively must return with me to White Cliffs, to bear Mrs.</p>
<p class="p1">Georgia company, until some other companion can be procured for her.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Catherine is at her brother’s cabin, as I told you.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“The same cabin he occupied before I left home?”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Certainly.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Major Clifton entered the gig, and turned the horse’s head towards the</p>
<p class="p1">dell in which the overseer’s cabin stood. When he drew up before the</p>
<p class="p1">door, Carl came out to welcome him, and invite him to alight.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“No, thank you, send Catherine hither,” he said—</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Carl looked very much as though he did not intend to obey this haughty</p>
<p class="p1">behest—but Catherine had already heard the demand, and appeared at the</p>
<p class="p1">door.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“How-do-you-do, Kate? Mrs. Georgia Clifton is at my house, and I wish</p>
<p class="p1">you to return with me to attend upon her. Come, get your bonnet, at</p>
<p class="p1">once, Catherine, for I am rather hurried.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“We cannot spare Catherine, sir,” said Carl, in a tone of displeasure.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“I did not address myself to you, my good fellow,” said Major Clifton,</p>
<p class="p1">looking over his head, and through the door of the cabin, watching</p>
<p class="p1">Catherine, as she tied on her bonnet.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">When Kate same out, he handed her into the gig, and nodding carelessly</p>
<p class="p1">to the flushed, indignant Carl, drove off. When they had driven a little</p>
<p class="p1">way—</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Catherine,” he said, “is that man your full brother?”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Yes, sir.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“The same father and mother?”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Yes, sir.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Humph! You are not at all alike in feature. Are you very much attached</p>
<p class="p1">to this brother, Catherine?”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Yes, sir.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Humph.” He did not speak again until they had reached White Cliffs,</p>
<p class="p1">when he handed her out, and said—“Catherine, Mrs. Georgia is greatly</p>
<p class="p1">fatigued; I wish you to attend to her comforts, this evening—do you</p>
<p class="p1">hear?”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Yes, sir,” replied Kate.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">The next day Mrs. Clifton, of Hardbargain, came over to call on Georgia.</p>
<p class="p1">And afterwards, at the earnest solicitation of her son, she paid them a</p>
<p class="p1">visit of a week. Major Clifton busied himself with the settlement of the</p>
<p class="p1">estate. Although the great debts of the late Mr. Clifton could not be</p>
<p class="p1">recovered of him, he determined to pay them all. A great many of them he</p>
<p class="p1">discharged at once, by cash; and in payment of others, he gave notes,</p>
<p class="p1">bearing interest. The calling in of these numerous debts, and the</p>
<p class="p1">arrangement of the terms of payment, and other matters, occupied him</p>
<p class="p1">nearly two months, so that it was the last of autumn before he was ready</p>
<p class="p1">to set out on his journey.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">He had taken leave of his mother the evening previous to the day upon</p>
<p class="p1">which he was to leave home. The next morning, in parting from Mrs.</p>
<p class="p1">Georgia and Catherine, he took leave of the lady, in a tender and</p>
<p class="p1">respectful manner, raising her hand to his lips—but he drew Kate to his</p>
<p class="p1">bosom, and pushing back the rippling waves of chestnut hair, that</p>
<p class="p1">concealed or shaded two-thirds of her massive forehead, he said, gravely</p>
<p class="p1">and sweetly—</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“What are you going to do with all this brain while I am gone, Kate? How</p>
<p class="p1">much longer will it lie fallow? Well! Never mind!” He kissed her freely</p>
<p class="p1">and fondly as a near relative might, and bowing once more to Mrs.</p>
<p class="p1">Georgia, hastened away. He paused upon the threshold of the door</p>
<p class="p1">however, seemed to hesitate, then suddenly came back, seized the hand of</p>
<p class="p1">Kate, and drew her out upon the porch. “Catherine,” he said, “do you</p>
<p class="p1">remember a promise you made me once—not to marry without my consent?”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Yes, sir, I remember it.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“I hold you to that promise, Kate. I must speak plainly to you at the</p>
<p class="p1">risk or the certainty of wounding your feelings; yours is a singular</p>
<p class="p1">position, Catherine—a girl of humble birth, quite penniless, yet with</p>
<p class="p1">education and accomplishments that fit her to grace a higher circle. It</p>
<p class="p1">is not likely, Catherine, that any gentleman in this part of the country</p>
<p class="p1">will ever become a suitor for your hand, and no one who is not a</p>
<p class="p1">gentleman should be permitted to do so!—Therefore, Catherine, I wish you</p>
<p class="p1">to promise me not to listen to any proposals without my consent.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“I promised you long ago, sir. I will keep that promise until you</p>
<p class="p1">release me from it!”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“That is a good girl! Now, then, once more good-bye,” and again he</p>
<p class="p1">folded her to his bosom, and then, indeed, he was gone.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Catherine turned with the intention of seeking her own room, but was</p>
<p class="p1">instantly confronted by Mrs. Georgia Clifton, who stood before her with</p>
<p class="p1">pallid cheek, set teeth, and gleaming eyes. She caught the wrist of the</p>
<p class="p1">girl, and keeping a strong, vice-like grasp upon it, dragged her almost</p>
<p class="p1">with violence into the parlor before the window, and casting herself</p>
<p class="p1">into a chair, pulled Catherine up before her, and fixed those wild,</p>
<p class="p1">dilated, star-like eyes upon her face. It fell blushing under the gaze.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“You love that man,” she said, drawing her breath hardly, like one in a</p>
<p class="p1">passing pain.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">The blush deepened upon Catherine’s cheek, but she did not reply in</p>
<p class="p1">words.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Speak! Answer me! You love that man?” she repeated, clutching the wrist</p>
<p class="p1">of the girl so tightly as to cause her to wince.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Madam, I am grateful to Major Clifton—he is my benefactor—he cares for</p>
<p class="p1">me, and I am grateful to him.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“He is an arrogant man—he reminded you of your low birth.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“I know he did, madam, and perhaps I ought to have vindicated our common</p>
<p class="p1">human nature, and told him, as I tell you now, that there is no such</p>
<p class="p1">thing in God’s universe as low birth, that every child comes into His</p>
<p class="p1">world with equal claim upon His people; perhaps it was my duty to have</p>
<p class="p1">told him this, only I am always a coward before Major Clifton, and never</p>
<p class="p1">can say the right thing at the right time to _him_, as I can to others.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“You love him! That is the reason! And you are a fool if you do not know</p>
<p class="p1">it, or a hypocrite if, knowing it, you deny it. But he _despises_ your</p>
<p class="p1">love! He said to you, himself, that no _gentleman_ would be likely to be</p>
<p class="p1">a suitor for your hand!”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“I know he did, lady. His care for me makes him say rough, blunt things</p>
<p class="p1">sometimes. I can bear them from him.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“You love him! Deny it, if you dare! But you are an idiot! an idiot! if</p>
<p class="p1">you do not take _his hint_ to conquer that passion! He said it was not</p>
<p class="p1">likely that any gentleman would ever become a suitor for your hand! _he_</p>
<p class="p1">is a gentleman—therefore he can never stoop to _you_! You do not answer</p>
<p class="p1">me! Do you, perchance, deceive yourself with the idea that he ever</p>
<p class="p1">will?”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Lady—_no_, I do not deceive myself with the idea that he will ever</p>
<p class="p1">‘stoop’ to marry me. The woman that Major Clifton shall marry, if he</p>
<p class="p1">ever marries, will be quite worthy of him, and that will preclude the</p>
<p class="p1">idea of his ‘stooping’ to her.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“And that woman will not be _you_, presumptuous girl. Do you dare to</p>
<p class="p1">hope it will? Speak! Answer me!”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Lady!” said Catherine, in a tone of grave and dignified rebuke,</p>
<p class="p1">“considering the recent bereavement of Major Clifton, the discussion</p>
<p class="p1">into which you have drawn me is indelicate, to use no harsher term!”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“‘Recent!’ It is of five months’ standing! You evade my question! You</p>
<p class="p1">evade _all_ my questions! I asked you if you loved him! Answer me!”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Lady! long ago my heart became too unruly for my own management, and I</p>
<p class="p1">gave it, with all its desires and affections, to God. I love nothing out</p>
<p class="p1">of Him!”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“And do you expect Archer Clifton will ever marry you? Answer that!”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Madam, I expect nothing.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Do you hope it, then?”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Lady, I hope nothing.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“You prevaricate, girl! Do you _wish_ it then?”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Madam, I only wish that God may appoint all times, seasons and events</p>
<p class="p1">in my life—making me humble, generous and grateful in prosperity, if it</p>
<p class="p1">comes; and strong, courageous and patient in adversity, if, as is most</p>
<p class="p1">likely, _that_ comes!”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Humph—would it make you happy to be the wife of Archer Clifton?”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Mrs. Clifton, you have no right to ask me that question!”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Yet I _do_ ask you, and I insist upon a reply!”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“And I decline giving it.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“I am answered! You love Archer Clifton! You feed your heart upon the</p>
<p class="p1">secret hope of one day being his wife! And now listen to me, girl!” she</p>
<p class="p1">exclaimed, every vestige of prudence and self-restraint swept away by</p>
<p class="p1">her rising passion, “_I, too_, day and night, feed my soul upon one</p>
<p class="p1">desperate hope—that I live for, would die for, or go to perdition for!</p>
<p class="p1">_I, too_, love Clifton. I loved him the first hour I ever saw him. I</p>
<p class="p1">have loved him ever since, only more madly for every obstacle, danger,</p>
<p class="p1">_duty_ that stood between, dividing us! I have schemed, dared, _sinned_</p>
<p class="p1">for him! Twice he has been snatched from me by fate, twice restored to</p>
<p class="p1">my hopes! Oh! I know my own strong will had much to do with that</p>
<p class="p1">restoration! He is given to my hopes again! Think you, _now_, that you</p>
<p class="p1">can win him from me? _No_, idiot! If there be any power in my own soul,</p>
<p class="p1">on earth, in Heaven, or in hell to help me, I will find it out, and</p>
<p class="p1">enlist it to give me this one desire of my heart, this man’s love! Since</p>
<p class="p1">first I ever beheld his face, I have dreamed, hoped, toiled, _lived_ for</p>
<p class="p1">nothing else! I have suffered for him! Oh! angels and devils! how I have</p>
<p class="p1">suffered for him! In the days when he came wooing Carolyn, wooing her</p>
<p class="p1">before the face of _me_, bound with indissoluble chains!—me, loving him</p>
<p class="p1">as _she_ had no power or conception of loving anything! Many times I was</p>
<p class="p1">almost mad with despair!—knowing, too, if he would only love me I should</p>
<p class="p1">be nearly mad with joy! I have sacrificed great prospects for him. Yes!</p>
<p class="p1">little as you think me capable of it! This summer I might have made a</p>
<p class="p1">splendid alliance in Richmond—a traveling nobleman—an English nobleman,</p>
<p class="p1">girl! a baron with an annual rental of thirty thousand pounds</p>
<p class="p1">sterling—with seats in the three kingdoms, and a palace in Portman</p>
<p class="p1">Square. I rejected him, when I knew that Clifton was free! In the faint</p>
<p class="p1">hope of winning Clifton, I would not bind myself. All that I have ever</p>
<p class="p1">done of good or of evil has had him for its end and object! I was the</p>
<p class="p1">belle, queen, _idol_ of Richmond. If I schemed and toiled for a</p>
<p class="p1">position, and gloried in my success, it was that _he_ might hear of it,</p>
<p class="p1">and his pride might be enlisted for me! You saw me one winter at the</p>
<p class="p1">governor’s reception! You saw how I was worshiped there! But _he_ was</p>
<p class="p1">present—and free, and I did not care what the thousands thought of me, I</p>
<p class="p1">only cared what that unit might think!” Her voice sank into tenderness,</p>
<p class="p1">and she paused, and dropped her brow into both open hands. But soon</p>
<p class="p1">raising her head again, she said, “Look at me well! Ay, look! What sort</p>
<p class="p1">of a rival do you take me to be? If you cannot guess, I will tell you! I</p>
<p class="p1">am not superstitious or scrupulous, as you are! I am one, who, for my</p>
<p class="p1">soul’s great passion, will do, or dare, or suffer anything! I ask no</p>
<p class="p1">leave of earth or Heaven for what I do! I do what I will, or _can_, and</p>
<p class="p1">take the consequences; earth or Heaven can but punish, and I can risk or</p>
<p class="p1">bear it!—for there is no pain or loss in the universe that I weigh with</p>
<p class="p1">the loss of my love! And not for the fear of eternal perdition—not for</p>
<p class="p1">the hope of everlasting salvation, will I forego the joy of my mortal</p>
<p class="p1">love! Now, hear me, girl!” She rose upon her feet, bending over</p>
<p class="p1">Catherine, with her hand clutched upon the maiden’s shoulder with a</p>
<p class="p1">vice-like grip, and, gazing into her eyes with contracted, gleaming</p>
<p class="p1">pupils, she said,—while her voice dropped into the low, deep, stern tone</p>
<p class="p1">of intense and concentrated passion, in which every word, syllable,</p>
<p class="p1">letter was articulated with a distinct, metallic ring:—“Now, hear me! If</p>
<p class="p1">you dare to come between me and my love—by the living Lord that sent my</p>
<p class="p1">burning soul upon this dull earth, and who can hurl it hence to a</p>
<p class="p1">burning perdition—I will find a way to kill you! Do you hear me?”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Catherine grew pale beneath the tiger eye and clutch of the fearful</p>
<p class="p1">woman, but she answered—</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Madam, I have heard you utter wild and wicked words. I will endeavor to</p>
<p class="p1">forget them.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Remember them! You are warned!”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">And releasing her hold, the dark lady passed from the room.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Catherine remained sitting where she had left her, appalled by the</p>
<p class="p1">exhibition of demoniac passion she had witnessed. One pain and one fear</p>
<p class="p1">possessed her above all others—deep regret that this most wicked woman</p>
<p class="p1">had evidently already attained such an ascendancy over the mind of</p>
<p class="p1">Clifton, and dread lest, in despite of all the sin, she would gain her</p>
<p class="p1">object—his hand! But Catherine carried all her doubts and fears to her</p>
<p class="p1">Heavenly Father. And soon to her clear, strong mind it became evident,</p>
<p class="p1">that however wicked and unscrupulous, potent and dangerous the Circe</p>
<p class="p1">might be on ordinary occasions, she possessed too little</p>
<p class="p1">self-government, was under the influence of too strong and impetuous</p>
<p class="p1">passions, to succeed in maintaining any long course of duplicity, such</p>
<p class="p1">as would be necessary to the accomplishment of her purpose. And Kate</p>
<p class="p1">became calm. She wished to leave the house. She could ill bear to live</p>
<p class="p1">under the same roof with this woman, and meet her at least three times a</p>
<p class="p1">day, at meals, if no oftener. But she had promised Major Clifton to</p>
<p class="p1">remain with Mrs. Georgia until she should have other company, and she</p>
<p class="p1">must keep her promise. It was, besides, doubly sacred, being made to</p>
<p class="p1">him, and the pain it brought her was endurable—borne for him.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Mrs. Georgia sought the garden, the open air, anywhere where she could</p>
<p class="p1">breathe freely. When the storm in her bosom had subsided, and reason was</p>
<p class="p1">again in the ascendant, she could have torn her hair and beat her</p>
<p class="p1">breast, yea, and rent her garments with excess of chagrin, to think that</p>
<p class="p1">she had so betrayed herself to Catherine. She did not fully believe that</p>
<p class="p1">Catherine would repeat this scene where it could injure her, or</p>
<p class="p1">anywhere, in fact. Still, she thought it safer to guard against such a</p>
<p class="p1">contingency, and while _she herself_ still possessed the unshaken</p>
<p class="p1">confidence and respect of Major Clifton, to impugn the conduct and</p>
<p class="p1">character of Catherine, and thus forestall and invalidate any testimony</p>
<p class="p1">she might hereafter give. She felt that she must proceed very</p>
<p class="p1">cautiously. A plan of correspondence had been arranged with Major</p>
<p class="p1">Clifton, previous to his departure. She soon began to receive long</p>
<p class="p1">letters from him, filled with interesting descriptions of the countries</p>
<p class="p1">through which he passed, the people whom he met, and philosophical</p>
<p class="p1">comments upon both. And to these she replied in other letters, full of</p>
<p class="p1">appreciation, admiration, gratitude, and breathing, besides, the</p>
<p class="p1">highest, purest, most disinterested sentiments and opinions upon all the</p>
<p class="p1">subjects of their correspondence. Into these letters, she gradually</p>
<p class="p1">introduced the name of Catherine—carelessly, at first, as if she thought</p>
<p class="p1">little about her, one way or the other,—as thus: “Catherine is with me</p>
<p class="p1">still—she desires to be remembered;” then, in a second letter, by a</p>
<p class="p1">slight line of praise, as though the girl was rather winning upon her,</p>
<p class="p1">as—“Catherine is well. By the way, what a remarkably clever girl she</p>
<p class="p1">is;” then, in another, with warmer panegyric, as though she really very</p>
<p class="p1">much improved upon longer acquaintance, thus: “How can I ever thank you</p>
<p class="p1">sufficiently for placing Catherine with me?” Next came high encomiums</p>
<p class="p1">upon Catherine’s talents, in this wise: “Catherine has left me, and is</p>
<p class="p1">with your mother, as no doubt the latter has written you. Apropos! What</p>
<p class="p1">a mind that girl has! Did you ever observe?” And then, in a subsequent</p>
<p class="p1">epistle, came an expression of wonder at the “diplomatic” character of</p>
<p class="p1">Kate’s intellect, and an opinion that the writer really believed her</p>
<p class="p1">thrown away in private life. And next, a cooler mention of the maiden,</p>
<p class="p1">with the hint of a fear that she was gaining the mastery over Mrs.</p>
<p class="p1">Clifton’s strong mind. Finally, after some months, she wrote thus, as if</p>
<p class="p1">speaking frankly from a sense of duty, and at the cost of great pain: “I</p>
<p class="p1">fear that I have been greatly deceived in my estimate of Catherine’s</p>
<p class="p1">good principles. How shall I introduce what I am about to say to you?</p>
<p class="p1">But you had best come home and see for yourself. For I know that your</p>
<p class="p1">mother is in the power of as dangerous an intriguante as I ever heard</p>
<p class="p1">of; and mind—she will influence Mrs. Clifton to disinherit her own son,</p>
<p class="p1">and bequeath _her_ the farm at Hardbargain. That ‘Maria Teresa’ brow of</p>
<p class="p1">hers meant something, after all. But you do not know with what pain I</p>
<p class="p1">write this, Archer! I cannot pursue the subject—only regard for you, and</p>
<p class="p1">fidelity to your interests, would have drawn me to its discussion. I</p>
<p class="p1">advise you to come home and look after your own welfare!”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">What influence this had upon Major Clifton, will be seen in the sequel.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">And while Georgia was exercising her power abroad, she was busy at home</p>
<p class="p1">also. Having heard or guessed at Colonel Conyer’s “foolish” attachment</p>
<p class="p1">to Catherine, she wrote and invited him to make up a party of his own</p>
<p class="p1">friends, and come down and spend Christmas with her. And the gallant</p>
<p class="p1">officer, delighted with this quintessence and perfection of confidence</p>
<p class="p1">and hospitality—this _carte blanche_ to be filled up at his own</p>
<p class="p1">pleasure, wrote and most gratefully accepted the invitation for himself</p>
<p class="p1">and “friends.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">                             </span>CHAPTER XXVII.</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">                               </span>CATHERINE.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">                </span>Now has descended a serener hour—KEATS.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Colonel Conyers exercised tact and discretion in availing himself of the</p>
<p class="p1">privilege granted him by Georgia. In consideration of the recent</p>
<p class="p1">affliction of the family, he made up a very quiet and appropriate</p>
<p class="p1">party—namely, the lady’s father, the artist, a pale young clergyman who</p>
<p class="p1">was suffering for country air, and the wife and sister of the latter.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">After his arrival at White Cliffs, Mrs. Georgia gave him every</p>
<p class="p1">opportunity of renewing his acquaintance with Catherine, and every</p>
<p class="p1">encouragement to persist in his suit. Girls, she said, were often</p>
<p class="p1">whimsical, and Catherine was especially shy, but disposed to think</p>
<p class="p1">highly of her suitor, and well worth the trouble of perseverance.</p>
<p class="p1">Colonel Conyers thereupon grew importunate, and Catherine became</p>
<p class="p1">distressed at his persistance, and announced her intention of returning</p>
<p class="p1">to Hardbargain. When her lover heard this, his grief seemed unbounded—he</p>
<p class="p1">had so long counted on success, so long been deceived by Mrs. Georgia’s</p>
<p class="p1">assurances, and by Catherine’s gentleness of denial, that now when his</p>
<p class="p1">hopes were quite overthrown, he became passionate and vehement in his</p>
<p class="p1">demonstrations of sorrow. His trouble affected Catherine very deeply.</p>
<p class="p1">She went and sat down by him, and laid her hand upon his shoulder, and</p>
<p class="p1">said, in her gentle sympathetic tones—</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Do not grieve so; indeed I am not worth so much love or so much</p>
<p class="p1">regret—indeed I am not—I am a poor girl, very ignorant of society, very</p>
<p class="p1">full of weakness and error.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Oh, Catherine! Catherine! that is nothing to the purpose! You are what</p>
<p class="p1">you are, and I adore you! Do not make me wretched.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Heaven knows I do not wish to! I am your friend—_indeed_ I am. I would</p>
<p class="p1">do anything in the world to give you peace, indeed I would—except—”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Except love me, proud girl!”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“‘Proud?’ No, I am not proud. Why should I be? Do not mock me! Indeed I</p>
<p class="p1">feel that you have conferred the greatest honor upon me in your</p>
<p class="p1">preference. An offer of his hand is the highest mark of respect and</p>
<p class="p1">confidence a man can give a woman; the world would think it higher</p>
<p class="p1">still, coming from one of your rank to one of mine. I myself should in</p>
<p class="p1">any case be proud of your regard, only—”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Well? ‘Only?’”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Only I feel so grieved to see you look so sorrowfully; but—”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Well, my dear girl, well! but what?”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">She paused, a slight blush suffused her cheek—she gathered courage and</p>
<p class="p1">went on to say—</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“I do not know why I should not speak anything that may be upon my</p>
<p class="p1">heart, at whatever cost to my natural feelings, if the hearing of it</p>
<p class="p1">will do good to any human being. Yes! I will speak, for your sake. I do</p>
<p class="p1">not fear to speak, for I have perfect confidence in you. Listen then,</p>
<p class="p1">Colonel Conyers, dear friend. You are not the only one who has missed</p>
<p class="p1">earthly happiness. I think it must be written in the book of fate, that</p>
<p class="p1">we may not have those whom we love too deeply—in other words, that we</p>
<p class="p1">may not have idols. It seems to me, that notwithstanding all other</p>
<p class="p1">troubles, it would make us too happy, in an existence designed chiefly</p>
<p class="p1">for trial and probation.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“That is a sad, strange, despairing sentiment, for one so young!”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“No, not despairing—for if we may not have joy, there remain the peace</p>
<p class="p1">and cheerfulness found in duty. And if we may not have the love of the</p>
<p class="p1">heart’s idol, there remain the affection of relatives, the esteem of</p>
<p class="p1">friends, the love of God, and the hope of Heaven.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Catherine, you have loved. Tell me about it my child.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“I intended to tell you about it. It is the best proof of entire</p>
<p class="p1">confidence and esteem that I can give you. It will show you how highly I</p>
<p class="p1">value you, and it will assure you also, of the utter impossibility of</p>
<p class="p1">getting a heart that is not mine to give—if it were worth giving.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">She paused in great embarrassment, her cheeks were suffused with</p>
<p class="p1">blushes, yet she seemed resolved to proceed. As if to assist her, he</p>
<p class="p1">said—</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“This being whom you deify with your love, my child! what a splendid,</p>
<p class="p1">what a magnificent nature he must have! what transcendant personal</p>
<p class="p1">attractions! what an intellect! what a heart! Is it not so? tell me!”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Ah! no; you are mistaken; these things excite admiration and wonder,</p>
<p class="p1">they do not of themselves win affection. Oh, no! he of whom you speak,</p>
<p class="p1">is not so handsome as you are; he has no more mind than you have, and</p>
<p class="p1">not so much heart—even _I_ admit that.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“And yet you love him, and can love him.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Even so—do you wonder at it? Have not you passed by women—handsome,</p>
<p class="p1">graceful, accomplished—to fix upon a plain country girl like me?”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Oh, but not women with your candor, purity and strength of mind. Oh,</p>
<p class="p1">Kate! what depths of truth and innocence you have revealed in the very</p>
<p class="p1">confession you have made me! Who else but yourself dared make such a</p>
<p class="p1">revelation?”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Catherine looked up at the speaker in doubt.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Go on, dear girl. Tell me that this man adores you, and I will never,</p>
<p class="p1">while I live, trouble you with myself again.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Ah, no! it was nothing like that which I set out to tell you. Ah, no! I</p>
<p class="p1">only wished to let you know—that your case of disappointed affection is</p>
<p class="p1">not solitary—that I too have missed life’s crowning joy—the love of one</p>
<p class="p1">I love. He does not even notice me now. I never permit myself to dream</p>
<p class="p1">that he will ever love me. Yet I would like to live with him, to serve</p>
<p class="p1">him—myself unknown, unnoticed, if I might only be near him. I envy the</p>
<p class="p1">waiting-maids and men, and even the dogs, who are full-feasted every</p>
<p class="p1">day, with the presence for which my heart starves. I would like to give</p>
<p class="p1">my life to his service, but I am unnecessary to his smallest need. Well!</p>
<p class="p1">I cannot do him any good; but I serve one who is dear to him, and so I</p>
<p class="p1">stay the hunger of my heart. Please do not think ill of me for telling</p>
<p class="p1">you all this. It would grieve me to have you think any evil of me. I</p>
<p class="p1">esteem you, and want your esteem. I have done some violence to my</p>
<p class="p1">instincts in telling you this. Do not think ill of me for doing so. I</p>
<p class="p1">only do it that you may know you are not the only one in the world who</p>
<p class="p1">is——_not happy_.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Think ill of you, Catherine! Do anything but adore you—and mourn your</p>
<p class="p1">loss forever—if lose you I must—oh, Heaven!”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“This life is a tragedy—for always that which is dearest, is lost in it,</p>
<p class="p1">and it ends in death. The closing scene is the corpse, the shroud, the</p>
<p class="p1">coffin—and the curtain drops upon the grave—all beyond is hidden—except</p>
<p class="p1">to the eye of faith. My experience of life has been all darkness, clouds</p>
<p class="p1">and storm—and the transient gleams of gladness or of hope have been—not</p>
<p class="p1">like the sunshine, but like the lightning. Yet through all the grief,</p>
<p class="p1">and gloom, and the tempting doubt, the ‘still, small voice’ of God’s</p>
<p class="p1">spirit has spoken to my soul, and comforted me.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Oh, Catherine, my child! that I could make your life all sunshine—that</p>
<p class="p1">you would let me try—I do believe I could make you happy.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Catherine shook her head, slowly, with a sad smile, saying—</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“We all believe that! We all think that in _us only_ is vested the power</p>
<p class="p1">of making those we love happy. It is because we know that we are</p>
<p class="p1">willing, anxious to do more for them than any other person would! It is</p>
<p class="p1">a fond error. Our efforts—our greatest sacrifices are often needless, as</p>
<p class="p1">we ourselves are nothing to our gods of flesh.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Am I nothing—nothing to you, then?”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“You are my dear and honored friend.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Oh, Catherine, I could make your life happy! Nay, but do not look</p>
<p class="p1">incredulous—I know I _could_. My love is not selfish, like that of most</p>
<p class="p1">other men. It is perfectly disinterested. It only asks to serve you. It</p>
<p class="p1">only desires to see you at ease. Dear Kate, you have told me all on your</p>
<p class="p1">heart—you might lay that heart, with all its burden of unrequited</p>
<p class="p1">affection, upon my bosom, and I would comfort, and cherish, and sustain</p>
<p class="p1">it, until I should win its love all to myself.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Again, and more mournfully, the girl shook her head—</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Do not pursue this subject, Colonel Conyers. Dear friend, by dwelling</p>
<p class="p1">upon our wild wishes, they grow to seem hopes, and probabilities, and</p>
<p class="p1">certainties. In my youth—”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“In ‘your youth’? How many years ago was that, Catherine?”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Strange!—but at eighteen, I really feel no longer young.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Yet it is not winter, but a wintry spring, that chills your young life.</p>
<p class="p1">That is not uncommon. Spring—the spring of hope, the spring of joy, the</p>
<p class="p1">spring of life will open indeed by-and-by, and be all the warmer and</p>
<p class="p1">brighter for its lateness—and my Catherine shall feel younger—but for</p>
<p class="p1">increased wisdom—at twenty-five, then she does now at eighteen—that lot</p>
<p class="p1">is for her—whosesoever treasure she may be. But what was she going to</p>
<p class="p1">say happened in her long passed youth?”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Catherine smiled, and said—</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Well, then—when life was newer and fresher, believing—as I do now—all</p>
<p class="p1">the promises of the Bible—and saying—as I do now—that the days of</p>
<p class="p1">miracles are not passed, and never will be so, until the days of God’s</p>
<p class="p1">omnipotence and man’s faith is passed, I used to say that I would pray</p>
<p class="p1">for what I wanted, though the granting of my prayer should seem to</p>
<p class="p1">involve an impossibility. But now, later in life, I have learned a</p>
<p class="p1">better lesson still, from the example of my Master. He might have saved</p>
<p class="p1">Himself by a miracle, but He chose rather to endure the cross and the</p>
<p class="p1">shame, for the working out of His Father’s will and purpose. God has a</p>
<p class="p1">purpose and a will in every—the humblest life. And now, for all other</p>
<p class="p1">vain and childish petitions, I substitute the words of the Saviour—‘Not</p>
<p class="p1">My will—but Thine, be done.’”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Catherine, you must be happy, even in this world. You are so good. You</p>
<p class="p1">must be made happy in the end.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Ah, I should be sorry to set up the plea of goodness—when I see so many</p>
<p class="p1">people so much better than I am, suffer so deeply. It is too often</p>
<p class="p1">represented that goodness is rewarded in this world—but, oh! how can any</p>
<p class="p1">one remember the life and death of a thousand martyrs, and the</p>
<p class="p1">crucifixion of the Saviour, and not feel that it is not so—and not feel</p>
<p class="p1">that the reverse is often so!”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Oh, Catherine, that is a very gloomy doctrine, and I will not believe</p>
<p class="p1">it! There is a hopeful text of Scripture that comes into my</p>
<p class="p1">mind—‘Godliness is profitable in all things, having the promise of the</p>
<p class="p1">life that _now is_, and that which is to come.’ It is the clouds of your</p>
<p class="p1">wintry spring that make everything look so gloomy to you!”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“It is not a gloomy doctrine! Oh, no! not gloomy, by all the hope and</p>
<p class="p1">illumining of the glorious Resurrection and Ascension.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>

<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Catherine returned to Hardbargain on Christmas Eve. It was a clear,</p>
<p class="p1">cold, crisp afternoon, and the level sun threw a glistening, yellow</p>
<p class="p1">lustre, like powdered gold dust, over the crusted surface of the</p>
<p class="p1">snow-clad earth. And as Kate’s little, rough-coated pony stepped freely</p>
<p class="p1">out over the ground, life and hope and joy tided back to her heart,</p>
<p class="p1">giving bloom to her cheeks, light to her eyes, and elasticity to all her</p>
<p class="p1">motions. She was very glad indeed to find herself on her way to the</p>
<p class="p1">farm, and about to exchange the feverish, exciting atmosphere of White</p>
<p class="p1">Cliffs, and the disturbing proximity of Georgia, for the long, calm</p>
<p class="p1">days, and long, calm evenings with Mrs. Clifton, at the farm-house. She</p>
<p class="p1">reached her destination at dusk. Mrs. Clifton met the girl with a smile</p>
<p class="p1">of pleasure, and welcomed her with a kiss of affection. Then she</p>
<p class="p1">conducted her into the parlor, where she made her sit down by the fire,</p>
<p class="p1">while she removed her bonnet and shawl. Next she summoned Henny, and</p>
<p class="p1">gave orders that tea should be served immediately, and a fire kindled in</p>
<p class="p1">Miss Catherine’s room, as the young lady was fatigued, and would wish to</p>
<p class="p1">retire early. There was in the manner of the lady upon this evening, and</p>
<p class="p1">from this evening, a maternal tenderness and solicitude, very soothing</p>
<p class="p1">and delightful to Catherine. This was so apparent to the domestics, that</p>
<p class="p1">they began to deport themselves towards the maiden with the deference</p>
<p class="p1">due to the daughter of the house.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">And how calmly and cheerfully the winter days passed. There was the</p>
<p class="p1">early rising, and the early breakfast, in the warm, bright, back parlor,</p>
<p class="p1">where the morning sun shone in. There was the leisurely talk over the</p>
<p class="p1">meal, about the occupations, which were also the amusements of the day.</p>
<p class="p1">After breakfast, came the ride around the farm, in the course of which</p>
<p class="p1">every field and barn and granary was inspected, and every negro quarter</p>
<p class="p1">visited. And during these rides, Mrs. Clifton gave Catherine much</p>
<p class="p1">information relating to agricultural matters.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“For, my dear,” she said, “some day you may be a planter’s wife, and</p>
<p class="p1">have all these things to look after, while your husband is in the public</p>
<p class="p1">service, absent with his regiment, or at the legislature.” To which</p>
<p class="p1">Catherine ventured no reply. And then came dinner, and the short</p>
<p class="p1">afternoon nap, and tea, and the long, serene evening by the fireside,</p>
<p class="p1">employed in needle-work, enlivened by rational, cheerful conversation,</p>
<p class="p1">and occasionally varied by music or reading, and finally ended by family</p>
<p class="p1">prayer and bed.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Mrs. Clifton and Catherine never, never wearied of each other. They had</p>
<p class="p1">many occupations for hands and heads—they were both strong, original</p>
<p class="p1">thinkers, and above all, were both deeply interested in the same</p>
<p class="p1">being—the absentee.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">And now Catherine enjoyed a very dear, but dangerous delight, in the</p>
<p class="p1">perusal of Major Clifton’s letters of travel. These letters arrived</p>
<p class="p1">about two in a month. And, ah! the evenings, when they came, were</p>
<p class="p1">festivals indeed to the recluse lady and the maiden. Often when one was</p>
<p class="p1">brought in, Mrs. Clifton reclining, through weakness, upon the sofa,</p>
<p class="p1">shading her eyes with her hand, would say, “Break the seal and read it</p>
<p class="p1">to me, dear Catherine.” And Kate would do so—drawing delicious draughts</p>
<p class="p1">of perilous pleasure from the poetic and artistic spirit that pervaded</p>
<p class="p1">every sentiment, narrative and description in the epistle. And on these</p>
<p class="p1">long, quiet winter evenings, very often the conversation turned upon the</p>
<p class="p1">absent son—the dear topic always introduced by his mother. It seemed as</p>
<p class="p1">if Mrs. Clifton wished to make Catherine thoroughly acquainted with his</p>
<p class="p1">character and disposition—with his faults and weaknesses, as well as</p>
<p class="p1">with his virtues and powers.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“My son has his serious imperfections, like other men, of course—though</p>
<p class="p1">your eyes contradict me, Catherine; if I, his partial mother, see them,</p>
<p class="p1">they exist, you may depend Archer is no demigod, my dear, in the</p>
<p class="p1">estimation of any one, but—well, no matter—don’t blush so—I am his</p>
<p class="p1">mother, and I love him, too, and think highly of him, of course, but I</p>
<p class="p1">acknowledge he is no angel, Kate, and I should be sorry you should take</p>
<p class="p1">him for one—disappointment would come of it, my dear. He is proud,</p>
<p class="p1">jealous, and suspicious as a Spaniard, and while under the influence of</p>
<p class="p1">these feelings, he is reserved and sullen as an Indian—yet these faults</p>
<p class="p1">of character have been so transfigured in my dear Kate’s affection, that</p>
<p class="p1">they have actually seemed virtues—the pride, jealousy and suspicion have</p>
<p class="p1">seemed high sense of honor and intellectual acumen—and the reserve and</p>
<p class="p1">sullenness—dignity! Is it not so, my dear?”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Kate’s eyes lighted, and her cheeks flushed highly, but not with</p>
<p class="p1">bashfulness—with an emotion that was swelling at her heart—and carried</p>
<p class="p1">away from self-consciousness by enthusiasm, she answered—</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Oh, madam! I know what I would say to you, if I only knew how to say</p>
<p class="p1">it. Heaven sends divine thoughts and feelings into my heart, and brain</p>
<p class="p1">sometimes, but they cannot pass thence into words—they are choked up</p>
<p class="p1">perhaps by sin or imperfection. Such a feeling I have now—heavenly</p>
<p class="p1">light, if I could only refract it—” She paused an instant, unconscious</p>
<p class="p1">that the lady was looking intently upon her. Then she spoke again,</p>
<p class="p1">slowly, in a kind of calm fervor—“Real affection—I do not mean passion</p>
<p class="p1">or imagination—but real love does _never_ invest its object with</p>
<p class="p1">_un_real virtues!—never!—all faults are the excess or the deficiency of</p>
<p class="p1">some virtue—well, real love sees its object not perhaps as he is at his</p>
<p class="p1">worst—not even perhaps so evil as he is even at his best, but as he may</p>
<p class="p1">become!—as he surely _will_ become, if that real affection continues</p>
<p class="p1">faithful to its trust. Ah! how strong that conviction is in my heart—how</p>
<p class="p1">weak upon my lips!”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“I understand you, Catherine, and may your true affection be the divine</p>
<p class="p1">alchemy that shall transmute all Archer Clifton’s faults into virtues.”</p>
<p class="p1">At this personal reply, Catherine’s eyes fell and her cheeks burned with</p>
<p class="p1">sudden self-recollection, and for weeks after this she could not recall</p>
<p class="p1">the conversation without deep blushes.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">More and more freely as the weeks passed by did Mrs. Clifton talk to</p>
<p class="p1">Kate of her son and his peculiarities, and the best way to meet them.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“You know, my dear Catherine, the apostle, in order to win proselytes,</p>
<p class="p1">made himself all things to all men. Archer is proud, and my dear girl</p>
<p class="p1">must raise herself a little out of that humility of manner which is very</p>
<p class="p1">distasteful to the haughty, except when exhibited towards themselves,</p>
<p class="p1">when it naturally becomes very acceptable.” This style of conversation,</p>
<p class="p1">addressed to her for weeks and months, was at once very pleasing and</p>
<p class="p1">very painful to Kate. It was sweet, it was dear beyond measure, to be</p>
<p class="p1">considered in this near relation to her beloved, to be addressed daily</p>
<p class="p1">and hourly as if she possessed the power of rendering his future life</p>
<p class="p1">better and happier, and so addressed by his own mother, too, but it was</p>
<p class="p1">also humiliating to be supposed to presume on the future esteem and</p>
<p class="p1">affection of one who had never addressed the language of love to her.</p>
<p class="p1">Often she thought of begging Mrs. Clifton to desist from this style of</p>
<p class="p1">conversation; but a certain bashfulness, a deep respect for the lady, a</p>
<p class="p1">distrust of herself and of her own experience, and the childish thought</p>
<p class="p1">that Major Clifton might have entrusted to his mother an intention that</p>
<p class="p1">he never confided to herself its object, and the delight of living in</p>
<p class="p1">this blessed illusion, and the fear of breaking the charm, kept her</p>
<p class="p1">silent for a long time, during which Mrs. Clifton gradually fell into</p>
<p class="p1">the manner of considering her and speaking to her as her son’s future</p>
<p class="p1">wife. All at once one day it suddenly struck Kate that Mrs. Clifton</p>
<p class="p1">might be the victim of a mistake, and under the impression that some</p>
<p class="p1">understanding or engagement existed between herself and Major Clifton,</p>
<p class="p1">and that her own silence and seeming acquiescence had served to confirm</p>
<p class="p1">this error. And this very natural and rational thought fell upon the</p>
<p class="p1">girl like a thunderbolt, utterly blasting and destroying all her</p>
<p class="p1">beautiful hopes, and covering her face with the blushes of deep</p>
<p class="p1">humiliation. She felt that she must undeceive Mrs. Clifton immediately.</p>
<p class="p1">So when they sat together at the work-table, before the evening fire,</p>
<p class="p1">and the lady spoke of her son saying, among other things—</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“The most unhappy trait in his character is his tendency to suspicion,</p>
<p class="p1">my love. Be straight-forward with him, Catherine, never have a secret</p>
<p class="p1">from him, not even one touching a little pleasant surprise, be perfectly</p>
<p class="p1">frank and openhearted with him, and, alas! even that course may not</p>
<p class="p1">always save you from suffering by his besetting sin, and when it does</p>
<p class="p1">not, Catherine, there is nothing left for you but patience and trust.</p>
<p class="p1">You see, on Archer’s behalf, I expect a great deal of you, my love, like</p>
<p class="p1">all mothers-in-law, I suppose.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Catherine’s face was bent over her work; ashamed of her supposed</p>
<p class="p1">mistake, ashamed of the weakness that now choked her voice, she remained</p>
<p class="p1">silent for some time. At length, gathering a false impression from her</p>
<p class="p1">long continued silence, Mrs. Clifton said—</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Do I hope too much from you, Kate, my love?”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">With an effort, Catherine controlled her emotion, looked up and replied,</p>
<p class="p1">steadily—</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“No, no, dear Mrs. Clifton, you do not demand too much of me. As far as</p>
<p class="p1">my will and my power, as far as the grace of God aids me, I will serve</p>
<p class="p1">Major Clifton with the affection and fidelity of a sister and a servant,</p>
<p class="p1">but I have not the smallest reason to suppose that he will ever admit me</p>
<p class="p1">to a friendship sufficiently intimate to make it possible for me to</p>
<p class="p1">affect his character and conduct in any way, even if I should presume to</p>
<p class="p1">wish it.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“My dear Kate, Archer’s wife will be his friend, companion and</p>
<p class="p1">counsellor—he never would be happy with a mere housekeeper or parlor</p>
<p class="p1">ornament, however beautifully accomplished and amiable—it is therefore</p>
<p class="p1">he will prize my dear Catherine’s clear, strong mind and proud heart—she</p>
<p class="p1">will be admitted to his closest thoughts and his noblest counsels, do</p>
<p class="p1">not doubt it.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Oh, madam, you do not comprehend me yet, I see. How deeply rooted your</p>
<p class="p1">mistake must be, dear lady! Oh, how shall I tell you? Indeed you are in</p>
<p class="p1">error if you suppose—if you suppose that—” Kate stopped short and burst</p>
<p class="p1">into tears.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Mrs. Clifton encircled her waist with her arm, and said—</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Come, Kate, stop all this blushing and weeping. Let us be confidential,</p>
<p class="p1">you and I, as mother and daughter should be, for you are as my own</p>
<p class="p1">daughter, Kate, and am I not a mother to you?”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Oh, yes! yes! dear lady!” said Catherine, taking her hand, and pressing</p>
<p class="p1">it to her bosom, and covering it with kisses. “Oh, yes, you are indeed</p>
<p class="p1">like a mother to me, if I were only worthy to be your daughter! and I</p>
<p class="p1">love and honor you more than ever a mother was loved and honored in this</p>
<p class="p1">world before, I do believe!”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Then let there be no reserve between us, dear Kate. Let us be open with</p>
<p class="p1">each other, as parent and child, whose loves, and hopes, and wishes are</p>
<p class="p1">the same. I have been plain with you all along, only gradually unfolding</p>
<p class="p1">your future, not to alarm your shyness—and to win your confidence. I</p>
<p class="p1">have longed for this confidence—this perfect openness between us—that we</p>
<p class="p1">might talk with more intelligence, and with more comfort—and I have</p>
<p class="p1">courted it by my own frankness; but in return for all my candor,</p>
<p class="p1">Catherine has shown me only reserve and blushes. Will she be more</p>
<p class="p1">confiding now?”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Alas, dearest lady, what can I say to you, but that you are greatly</p>
<p class="p1">mistaken—sadly mistaken—oh, yes, indeed, sadly mistaken,” replied Kate,</p>
<p class="p1">almost weeping again.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“I am not mistaken in supposing that Catherine loves my son. I am not</p>
<p class="p1">mistaken in knowing that the fact gives me more happiness than anything</p>
<p class="p1">else in the world. Yet I would like to hear Kate admit it.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Well, dearest lady—yes!—down, pride!—if it will give you any pleasure</p>
<p class="p1">to hear it, I must not withhold the confession—yes, I _do_ love your</p>
<p class="p1">son—so much—so much—that it will make me an old maid!”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Mrs. Clifton laughed, a little, low, jolly laugh. (The lady very seldom</p>
<p class="p1">laughed, and when she did, it had a strange, exceedingly pleasant effect</p>
<p class="p1">upon the hearer—it was a very agreeable surprise, revealing, as it were</p>
<p class="p1">under that grave, stern surface, traces of a mine of wit, humor, fun and</p>
<p class="p1">mischief, that must have existed, and frequently sparkled forth, ere the</p>
<p class="p1">sorrow and the seriousness of life smothered and extinguished it.) She</p>
<p class="p1">laughed her little, low, jolly laugh, and replied—</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“That were a strange effect of love, Catherine; but trust me, it will</p>
<p class="p1">not be so with Archer’s consent.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Dear Mrs. Clifton, forgive me for saying again, that you are very much</p>
<p class="p1">mistaken—never, never in his life, has Major Clifton bestowed upon me</p>
<p class="p1">one word, or look, that might be misconstrued by the vainest woman into</p>
<p class="p1">a preference!”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Well, Kate! I know that! I know that he has never addressed you on the</p>
<p class="p1">subject. But I know that he will do so. For he loves you, Catherine, and</p>
<p class="p1">has loved you from the first hour he ever saw you—even from the—the</p>
<p class="p1">night he sat and studied you in your brother’s cabin. And it is just as</p>
<p class="p1">certain that you will be his wife, as that you both will live to marry.</p>
<p class="p1">So, dearest, let there be no more reserve between us—consider this</p>
<p class="p1">marriage sure, as it really is—(so far as any future event is sure)—and</p>
<p class="p1">let me talk freely, for my time and opportunity is short.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Catherine raised her eyes to the sallow—almost cadaverous face of the</p>
<p class="p1">lady, and a conviction of the truth and reality of what she predicted,</p>
<p class="p1">forced itself upon her, with a sharp pang.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Now, dear Catherine, I did not ask you for that troubled look! Will</p>
<p class="p1">your heart ache because a dry leaf drops in the autumn, rather than</p>
<p class="p1">hangs shivering on the tree through half the winter? But, dear child, I</p>
<p class="p1">allude to this coming event, not to cast its ‘shadow’ over you, but to</p>
<p class="p1">explain why I wish now to use these days in making you as conversant</p>
<p class="p1">with the idiosyncracies of your future companion, as only years of</p>
<p class="p1">married life could do, and to prevent years, perhaps, of</p>
<p class="p1">misunderstanding and sorrow. There is something dreadful in the</p>
<p class="p1">discovery of unsuspected faults, _after_ marriage—and something very,</p>
<p class="p1">very mournful in the disappointment of the trusting affection, and in</p>
<p class="p1">the saddened efforts of the heart to adjust itself to the</p>
<p class="p1">circumstances—efforts that in one case out of ten, perhaps, succeed. But</p>
<p class="p1">if the worst is known before marriage, the man or the woman may consider</p>
<p class="p1">well whether they have the strength of heart to conquer their own</p>
<p class="p1">faults, and bear with those of their companion. That you would do all</p>
<p class="p1">this for your husband, Kate, I am convinced. I only talk now to smooth</p>
<p class="p1">your path of duty.” The lady here released Catherine from the embrace in</p>
<p class="p1">which she had held her through this conversation, and desired her to</p>
<p class="p1">ring for the servants to come in to prayers.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Catherine, as had been her custom for several weeks past—upon account of</p>
<p class="p1">Mrs. Clifton’s weakness—conducted the evening devotions.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">When prayers were over, and the servants dismissed, Catherine attended</p>
<p class="p1">Mrs. Clifton to her chamber, and assisted her with affectionate care</p>
<p class="p1">until she had retired to bed. Then, after receiving the lady’s parting</p>
<p class="p1">kiss, she hastened into her own chamber, threw herself upon the bed, and</p>
<p class="p1">gave way to a long-pent burst of sorrow. Within the last three years</p>
<p class="p1">Catherine had seen much sickness, death, and bereavement—one after</p>
<p class="p1">another of her associates or relations had faded and fallen, and she had</p>
<p class="p1">mourned their loss; and her life had taken a sombre hue, and sunken into</p>
<p class="p1">a depressed tone. But that this beloved friend, this kind benefactress,</p>
<p class="p1">this dear, dear companion—this more than mother, sister, _all_ to her</p>
<p class="p1">heart—should pass away from the earth and be seen no more! Oh! it</p>
<p class="p1">brought a sense of desolation that threw a shadow and a chill over all</p>
<p class="p1">the future—over even the bright hopes shining in the distance. And then</p>
<p class="p1">the identity of the love she bore mother and son together forced itself</p>
<p class="p1">upon her heart. And she felt that a union with the son could not give</p>
<p class="p1">her perfect content, unless the mother were there to share her love and</p>
<p class="p1">service, and to participate in their happiness. Without that mother’s</p>
<p class="p1">presence, their plan of life would be unfinished—their circle of love</p>
<p class="p1">incomplete. And oh! came the sharp, agonizing question, how could she</p>
<p class="p1">ever bear to lose the light, and warmth, and strength, imparted daily,</p>
<p class="p1">hourly, from that dear face—that face which had never looked on her but</p>
<p class="p1">in affection—that face, the very image of Clifton’s own, except that it</p>
<p class="p1">was sweeter, holier, and never, never harsh—how could she ever bear to</p>
<p class="p1">lose her sweet resting place on that more than maternal bosom—that bosom</p>
<p class="p1">on which she could ever lay her aching head, or aching heart, in perfect</p>
<p class="p1">peace and confidence, sure of being understood, sure of being</p>
<p class="p1">sympathized with? Oh! life would be darkened indeed when she should pass</p>
<p class="p1">away. The sense of sorrow was so sharp, so agonizing, that the girl</p>
<p class="p1">could have thrown herself upon the floor—could have wrestled with</p>
<p class="p1">Heaven, in wild prayer, that this life might be saved, and this sharp</p>
<p class="p1">anguish spared her. But Catherine was habitually self-restrained, and</p>
<p class="p1">she bore this mental anguish as she would have endured severe physical</p>
<p class="p1">pain—in silence, in patience, until her soul was subdued to the meekness</p>
<p class="p1">of resignation. And then prayer brought comfort.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">And she met the lady in the morning with a cheerful countenance. And</p>
<p class="p1">they spent the day as usual.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">So passed the winter and the spring. Though Mrs. Clifton failed visibly</p>
<p class="p1">from day to day, she still continued her rides around the farm, and her</p>
<p class="p1">general supervision of the household and of agricultural affairs, and</p>
<p class="p1">her instructions to Catherine. Her people, who well knew the nearly</p>
<p class="p1">hopeless state of her health, foretold that their mistress would keep up</p>
<p class="p1">and out to the very last—and finally die in her chair. Indeed, while</p>
<p class="p1">flesh and blood wasted away, her nervous energy seemed unimpaired, and</p>
<p class="p1">her cheerfulness was undiminished. She talked of her approaching</p>
<p class="p1">departure as calmly and pleasantly as she would have talked of going to</p>
<p class="p1">Richmond. Never obtruding the subject, however, unless necessity</p>
<p class="p1">demanded its introduction.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">The serenity and cheerfulness of the lady affected Catherine very</p>
<p class="p1">beneficially—“familiarizing” to her feelings the future, immortal life.</p>
<p class="p1">Catherine endeavored to persuade her to have a physician.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Why, so I would, Kate, if I had any specific disease; but when all the</p>
<p class="p1">frame is wearing out together very slowly and quietly, why call in a</p>
<p class="p1">doctor to disturb the harmony of natural decay, and painfully build up</p>
<p class="p1">one portion of the sinking frame at the expense of another? Why not fade</p>
<p class="p1">and fall easily, as all else in benign nature does?”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Catherine next suggested writing for Major Clifton to hasten home.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Why, my child? Why, because I am going the common road, should others</p>
<p class="p1">be hurried and worried? Everything in blessed nature and Divine</p>
<p class="p1">Revelation teaches us a sweeter lesson. No—Archer set out for a twelve</p>
<p class="p1">months’ tour; let him complete it. He will return this autumn. Quite</p>
<p class="p1">time enough, Catherine. I shall live till then, and longer. I can</p>
<p class="p1">calculate the progress of my body’s failing, and the duration of my</p>
<p class="p1">life, with almost mathematical precision. I shall live to meet Archer,</p>
<p class="p1">and to see you married, Catherine—and to leave you willing to survive me</p>
<p class="p1">and be happy without me. And why not, dear? for shall I not be happier</p>
<p class="p1">still?”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">And so, in sweet mutual confidence, in cheerful resignation, and in</p>
<p class="p1">patient hope, the summer passed, and autumn arrived in its glory.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">                  </span>That deepens into gloom.—MRS. HEMANS.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Notwithstanding all her habitual calmness and cheerful patience, Mrs.</p>
<p class="p1">Clifton began to grow uneasy at her son’s protracted stay. He had been</p>
<p class="p1">absent a year and a month. And even now, instead of setting out on his</p>
<p class="p1">return, he only wrote of coming home soon. At one time he was at Vienna,</p>
<p class="p1">at another at Berlin, then at the Hague, progressing, indeed, but very,</p>
<p class="p1">very slowly towards England and Liverpool, from which port he intended</p>
<p class="p1">to embark. Every letter that came from him at this period, was opened</p>
<p class="p1">and read with visible uneasiness by his mother. At length the glad</p>
<p class="p1">tidings came, a letter from the mid-ocean, brought by a swift sailing</p>
<p class="p1">packet-boat that had spoken the vessel in which he had embarked. He was</p>
<p class="p1">hastening home, and might now be expected at any hour. The news</p>
<p class="p1">contained in his letter excited the invalid so much upon the evening of</p>
<p class="p1">its reception, that she passed a sleepless night, and rose the next</p>
<p class="p1">morning weaker than she had ever been before; so weak, indeed, that she</p>
<p class="p1">was obliged, in coming down stairs, to lean on the arms of Catherine and</p>
<p class="p1">her maid for support. And when she reached the parlor, she was compelled</p>
<p class="p1">to recline in an easy-chair, propped up by pillows, and with her feet</p>
<p class="p1">supported by a foot-cushion. But her cheerfulness was undiminished. She</p>
<p class="p1">gave many directions as to the adjustment and adornment of the room, and</p>
<p class="p1">the preparation of certain dainties. Lastly she called Catherine to her</p>
<p class="p1">side, and took her hand. Catherine did not appear to the best advantage,</p>
<p class="p1">with her plain, dark gingham dress, and her chestnut hair divided simply</p>
<p class="p1">above her forehead, rippling in tiny wavelets around her broad temples,</p>
<p class="p1">and gathered into a twist behind. This plainness of style did not become</p>
<p class="p1">her strongly marked features. And the lady saw it, for she gazed</p>
<p class="p1">thoughtfully upon the girl awhile, and then lifting her hand, disengaged</p>
<p class="p1">a portion of her tresses from the comb, and let them fall, turning into</p>
<p class="p1">natural ringlets down her cheeks, saying—</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“There, Catherine, when hair curls naturally and voluntarily, it is</p>
<p class="p1">certain that the face it belongs to requires it so, and that it should</p>
<p class="p1">be permitted to follow its nature, for nature does all things well. Why</p>
<p class="p1">don’t you always wear your hair so? It is so much prettier.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Because, dear lady, I never thought it of any importance how my hair</p>
<p class="p1">was fixed, so that it looked neat. But I will wear it this way, if it</p>
<p class="p1">pleases you.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“It does. Your face is not a classic one, dear Kate, and none but a</p>
<p class="p1">classic face can bear that attic simplicity of style. Your countenance</p>
<p class="p1">is a very noble one, Kate, but its very nobility is hard and stern,</p>
<p class="p1">without the softening shadow of these ringlets nature has bestowed upon</p>
<p class="p1">you. There now, look in the mirror, my little Oliver Cromwell, your face</p>
<p class="p1">is much more womanly than before.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Catherine found it so. The soft, bright, drooping curls shaded and</p>
<p class="p1">rounded her large, square forehead into beautiful proportion to her</p>
<p class="p1">other features, and softened the expression of the whole. No girl but is</p>
<p class="p1">pleased to see herself improved in beauty, and it was with a bright</p>
<p class="p1">blush, half of pleasure, half of modesty, that the maiden returned to</p>
<p class="p1">the lady’s side.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Now, dear Kate, you must leave off that dingy gingham, and wear white</p>
<p class="p1">wrappers in the morning. It is early in the season, and you can wear</p>
<p class="p1">white a month longer yet, and by the end of that time, I suppose, the</p>
<p class="p1">world will expect you to wear black. You have no white wrappers though,</p>
<p class="p1">my dear!”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“No, madam, I never had one.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Well, you have two white cambric dresses, without ornament, they will</p>
<p class="p1">do for morning dresses. Do me the kindness to wear them. Nay, now,</p>
<p class="p1">Catherine, my dear, no hesitation, I will have it so. Go at once and put</p>
<p class="p1">on one of them.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Kate complied, and in a short time returned to the parlor—by this change</p>
<p class="p1">in the style of her toilet, almost transfigured, yet without the loss of</p>
<p class="p1">her noble characteristics. One thought troubled the maiden, the</p>
<p class="p1">question—What would Clifton think of this? How would he take it? Would</p>
<p class="p1">he suspect that she had dressed for his eyes? If he did his suspicions</p>
<p class="p1">would be well founded. And the consciousness of this truth, suffused</p>
<p class="p1">with blushes the cheeks of the ingenuous girl, and heightened all her</p>
<p class="p1">beauty.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">There was no certainty of Major Clifton’s advent that day—he might come</p>
<p class="p1">any day, but nevertheless they hoped for and expected his arrival. By a</p>
<p class="p1">change in the hours, the stage now reached L—— at noon. And Mrs. Clifton</p>
<p class="p1">had ordered dinner in the full expectation of having her son’s company</p>
<p class="p1">at that meal. Nor were their hopes destined to disappointment. A little</p>
<p class="p1">after one o’clock, the carriage that had been sent to L—— to meet the</p>
<p class="p1">stage, returned and drove up to the door. And Archer Clifton alighted</p>
<p class="p1">from it, and hastened joyfully into the house. Mrs. Clifton arose to</p>
<p class="p1">meet him, but, overpowered by agitation and weakness, she sank back into</p>
<p class="p1">her seat. Her son was before her in an instant, and had clasped her in</p>
<p class="p1">his arms, and pressed her to his breast, and kissed her fondly many</p>
<p class="p1">times, and sat her back in her chair to feast his eyes upon her beloved</p>
<p class="p1">face and form, before he noticed how cadaverous, how death-like, she</p>
<p class="p1">looked; then a startled expression of surprise and alarm sprung into his</p>
<p class="p1">countenance, and he turned upon Kate, to whom he had not yet spoken, a</p>
<p class="p1">glance of mingled inquiry, anger and reproach.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“You find me in poor health, Archer; but not worse, my son, than what</p>
<p class="p1">might have been expected.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“My dearest mother,” he began, but his voice choked, and to conceal the</p>
<p class="p1">emotion he could not entirely suppress, he turned to Catherine and gave</p>
<p class="p1">her a brother’s greeting in silence, but at the same time darting into</p>
<p class="p1">her eyes a look of stern rebuke from his own, which seemed to say, “You,</p>
<p class="p1">at least, should have written and informed me of this.” And the</p>
<p class="p1">suspicions excited by Mrs. Georgia rose darkly in his mind, but were</p>
<p class="p1">repressed again instantly.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Dearest Archer, I am not usually so ill as I seem to-day. I have never</p>
<p class="p1">been confined to my bed, or even my chair yet. Only to-day and</p>
<p class="p1">yesterday, the joy of looking for you has prevented my taking the usual</p>
<p class="p1">quantity of sleep. I shall be much better to-morrow. Sit down by me and</p>
<p class="p1">rest, and when you are rested, your room is quite ready for you, if you</p>
<p class="p1">wish to change your dress before dinner. Catherine, my love, will you go</p>
<p class="p1">and direct them to serve dinner?”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Catherine left the room and gave the necessary commands. Then she</p>
<p class="p1">ordered a boy to take Major Clifton’s baggage up into his chamber, and</p>
<p class="p1">went up stairs to show him where to put it. In the meantime, Major</p>
<p class="p1">Clifton, in looking upon his mother’s wasted form, had lost all</p>
<p class="p1">self-command, and saying hastily that he thought he would change his</p>
<p class="p1">traveling dress at once, hurried out of the room to give vent to a</p>
<p class="p1">passionate sorrow, no longer to be restrained. He ran up stairs, but</p>
<p class="p1">paused upon the first landing. Catherine, in leaving his room, found him</p>
<p class="p1">leaning upon the balustrades, with his face buried in his hands, weeping</p>
<p class="p1">convulsively. To women, there is something really appalling in a man’s</p>
<p class="p1">tears—we look upon them with more than pity—with awe—with something like</p>
<p class="p1">the feeling with which Mary and Martha must have witnessed the Saviour’s</p>
<p class="p1">tears—with deep reverence be it said. Catherine would have crept by and</p>
<p class="p1">slipped down stairs quietly, for she had a feeling of self-reproach for</p>
<p class="p1">having even seen that strong outburst of sorrow; but he stood up and</p>
<p class="p1">seized her hand, and drew her towards him, exclaiming—</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Stop, Catherine! You have seen my weakness! Now, tell me why you did</p>
<p class="p1">not write to me of this? Cruel and selfish girl! were you so intent upon</p>
<p class="p1">your own projects, that you could not find time to indite a line to let</p>
<p class="p1">me know that my mother was dying?”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Another burst of weeping prevented his hearing Catherine’s gentle</p>
<p class="p1">explanation, that Mrs. Clifton would not permit her to write. And Kate</p>
<p class="p1">was not anxious to exculpate herself from an unjust charge; indeed,</p>
<p class="p1">after once giving her little, meek explanation, she never thought of it</p>
<p class="p1">again—she only thought of his agony of regret, and only wished to soothe</p>
<p class="p1">it. He still held her wrist, unconsciously straining it in the strength</p>
<p class="p1">of his emotion, until it pained her severely. But she did not care for</p>
<p class="p1">that, she did not even feel it; she only cared to see him weep so</p>
<p class="p1">convulsively, and losing all self-consciousness, and with it all</p>
<p class="p1">reserve, she threw her arm around him, and dropping her head against him</p>
<p class="p1">most tenderly, most lovingly, she said—</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Oh, do not grieve so! do not! see how calm and cheerful she is! Try to</p>
<p class="p1">emulate her calmness!”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“I loved her, Kate! I loved her more than ever son loved mother before!</p>
<p class="p1">She was the worth of life to me! I loved her more than ever I loved</p>
<p class="p1">human being! More even than I ever loved you, Kate!”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">This was Clifton’s first declaration to Catherine, and a strange time,</p>
<p class="p1">place and circumstances, and a strange method of expressing his</p>
<p class="p1">preference had fallen upon them. “I loved her more than I ever loved</p>
<p class="p1">you, Kate!”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">But it did not seem strange to Catherine. It seemed perfectly natural</p>
<p class="p1">and in order. It did not startle her the least. It did not bring back</p>
<p class="p1">her womanly self-consciousness, for she answered, meekly—</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“I know it—I know you do. And, oh! don’t _you_ know that I would</p>
<p class="p1">willingly give my life for hers, if I could restore her, in health, to</p>
<p class="p1">your affections?”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“And yet you did not even write to let me know she was ill! Oh! girl!</p>
<p class="p1">girl! you were much to blame for that! It was bitterly wrong.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“I told you, but you did not hear me, that she would not permit me to</p>
<p class="p1">write; she did not wish to give you pain, or to interfere with your</p>
<p class="p1">arrangements for the year.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Catherine, that does not excuse you! Could not your own heart have told</p>
<p class="p1">you how precious, how inestimable to me would have been every hour of</p>
<p class="p1">her company when her days were numbered? Could you not have written to</p>
<p class="p1">me secretly?”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“I never did anything secretly in my life. I should never have thought</p>
<p class="p1">of doing so. Besides, I could not have had a secret from her, so open,</p>
<p class="p1">so frank, so noble as she is. No, I proposed to write for you to come</p>
<p class="p1">home, I entreated permission to do so, but she refused to grant it, and</p>
<p class="p1">I deferred to her better judgment. I would not have deceived her for the</p>
<p class="p1">world.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Then I have been unjust and unkind to you, Catherine, but you will</p>
<p class="p1">pardon me when I tell you—when you see how thoroughly weakened and</p>
<p class="p1">unmanned I am!”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">The gust of sorrow was over, and Kate, with sudden self-recollection</p>
<p class="p1">withdrew herself from him, deeply blushing, and hastened down stairs,</p>
<p class="p1">and the thought of her transient self-forgetfulness rendered the girl</p>
<p class="p1">even shyer than ever.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">He went into his room and refreshed himself with a new toilet. And when</p>
<p class="p1">he entered the parlor, an hour after, no one would have suspected from</p>
<p class="p1">his handsome, animated face, the existence of the sorrow that lay</p>
<p class="p1">subdued at the bottom of his heart.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">They dined together, and after dinner Catherine thought it best to</p>
<p class="p1">retire and leave the mother and son alone to enjoy more fully their</p>
<p class="p1">re-union. When she had left the room—</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“How pretty and lady-like Catherine is growing, madam,” said Major</p>
<p class="p1">Clifton, looking after her, but addressing his mother.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Yes,” replied Mrs. Clifton, “lady-like, but not very pretty; Kate will</p>
<p class="p1">never be pretty; but if she be ‘blessed to her mind,’ she will be more,</p>
<p class="p1">she will be handsome.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">After spending a long afternoon with his mother, Major Clifton took</p>
<p class="p1">temporary leave, and went over to White Cliffs, to pay his respects to</p>
<p class="p1">Mrs. Georgia. Most happily for all concerned, Georgia had just left home</p>
<p class="p1">for a visit of some weeks at Richmond—ignorant, it is to be supposed, of</p>
<p class="p1">Major Clifton’s arrival. He returned and spent the evening with the</p>
<p class="p1">ladies at Hardbargain.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">The next morning found Mrs. Clifton very much better—and in the evening</p>
<p class="p1">she rode out, accompanied by Major Clifton and Catherine. Mrs. Clifton’s</p>
<p class="p1">cheerfulness infected all the party—both upon this evening and</p>
<p class="p1">afterwards. Her decline was so gradual, so painless, that she never took</p>
<p class="p1">to her bed—but when weakest, sat in the easy-chair in the parlor, often</p>
<p class="p1">with a little light knitting in her hands, that she would leisurely work</p>
<p class="p1">upon, or drop into her lap, to be resumed at pleasure, while she</p>
<p class="p1">conversed with Catherine and Major Clifton, or listened while one of</p>
<p class="p1">them read, or both sang. There never were more pleasant, serene days,</p>
<p class="p1">than these of the invalid’s gentle decay. It was genial, pensive autumn;</p>
<p class="p1">the fall of the leaf without the house, and the fall of the leaf within.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Catherine was now the housekeeper. She had—through the increasing</p>
<p class="p1">weakness of the lady—so gradually slidden into this office, that she</p>
<p class="p1">scarcely knew at what time its whole burden had accumulated upon her.</p>
<p class="p1">One morning, while Catherine was in the store-room giving out meal and</p>
<p class="p1">bacon to the negroes, Mrs. Clifton and Major Clifton occupied the parlor</p>
<p class="p1">alone. He had been reading to her from Jeremy Taylor, but seeing that</p>
<p class="p1">she had dropped her knitting, and was sitting back with a look of</p>
<p class="p1">weariness, he thought it time to desist and close the book.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Dear mother, you are fatigued; will you have anything? What shall I</p>
<p class="p1">bring you?”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Nothing, my son. I am not wearied more than usual, and it will pass in</p>
<p class="p1">a few minutes.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">The lady was silent for a little while, during which Major Clifton</p>
<p class="p1">refrained from conversation. And then, after some little thought, she</p>
<p class="p1">raised her eyes until they met his own and looking at him full in the</p>
<p class="p1">face, she asked—</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“When are you going to marry Catherine, Archer?”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Major Clifton started violently, and looked at the lady in silent</p>
<p class="p1">astonishment.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Nay, pray answer me—my question is an earnest one.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“My dear madam, you have taken me by surprise!”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Necessary bluntness, Archer.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Very Oliver Cromwellish, madam, my mother.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“You must excuse it, dear Archer. You did not open the subject to me,</p>
<p class="p1">therefore, feeling more anxious upon that affair than any other on</p>
<p class="p1">earth, I am forced to broach it to you. But you have not answered my</p>
<p class="p1">question yet.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Dear madam—what—exactly—was it?”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“When are you going to marry Catherine?”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Upon my honor, my dear madam, I have no intention of marrying</p>
<p class="p1">Catherine; nor have I ever given her reason to suppose so.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Ah! I had thought, or rather, I had hoped otherwise,” said the lady,</p>
<p class="p1">relapsing into silence, while Major Clifton subsided into painful</p>
<p class="p1">thought. Again the dark suspicions insinuated by Mrs. Georgia, arose in</p>
<p class="p1">his mind, to be repressed again with loathing; and he said indignantly</p>
<p class="p1">to himself—“It is not true! I can never believe her to be an</p>
<p class="p1">intriguante. Georgia is mistaken—Georgia’s grateful and affectionate</p>
<p class="p1">interest in my welfare, leads her to unjust suspicions of others. Kate</p>
<p class="p1">is noble-hearted—Kate is true—is truth itself. It would be misery to</p>
<p class="p1">believe otherwise.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Mrs. Clifton gently interrupted his silent self-communion, by saying—</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Well, Archer, since you have no intention whatever of marrying</p>
<p class="p1">Catherine yourself, you can have no reasonable ground of objection to</p>
<p class="p1">her union with another?”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">He looked up in surprise and anxiety, but soon the startled expression</p>
<p class="p1">subsided into calmness, and he replied, coolly—</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“_Catherine’s_ union with another! Oh! the supposition involves an</p>
<p class="p1">impossibility.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“I know you think so, Archer. I know you feel perfectly secure of this</p>
<p class="p1">sweet girl, and just as easy about her as if she were secured to you by</p>
<p class="p1">all the chains that church and state can forge, and that is the reason</p>
<p class="p1">why you take things so coolly, and listen to your pride. But I tell you</p>
<p class="p1">that it is not as you think. You are not forever secure of Catherine.</p>
<p class="p1">Our moods of mind, and our views of things, change with time. And</p>
<p class="p1">however the maiden may feel or think now, if you hesitate for years</p>
<p class="p1">between your pride and love, she will naturally arrive at the conclusion</p>
<p class="p1">that many a generous hearted woman has come to before her, and say to</p>
<p class="p1">herself, ‘Well, I cannot be happy myself, but my life must not,</p>
<p class="p1">therefore, be wasted—I can make some one else happy,’ and being scorned</p>
<p class="p1">by one she loves, give herself away to one who loves her.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Major Clifton started to his feet, with all the dark side of his</p>
<p class="p1">character uppermost, exclaiming—</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Let her attempt it! I would stop such a marriage at the altar!</p>
<p class="p1">Catherine is mine, or nobody’s. She could not repel my claim.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Dear Archer, sit down; do not excite yourself or me. Remember, I am in</p>
<p class="p1">a dying state,” said the lady, as the best means of calming him.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Dear madam, forgive me—forgive me—but why introduce this very</p>
<p class="p1">embarrassing and highly exciting subject? I have had conflict enough in</p>
<p class="p1">my own bosom about it. I love your favorite, I love her jealously,</p>
<p class="p1">fiercely—I admit it—but there are objections and difficulties, which</p>
<p class="p1">time, or a new set of circumstances, may remove; meanwhile, I could not</p>
<p class="p1">bear to see her snatched from me. But there is time enough—even if I</p>
<p class="p1">should decide upon such a step, there is time enough. Kate is very young</p>
<p class="p1">yet.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“But you are not very young, Archer.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“I know it, dear madam. I have arrived at that age at which men do not</p>
<p class="p1">make imprudent marriages for love.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“But when they too often make unhappy marriages of convenience. Dear</p>
<p class="p1">Archer, it is a false and sinful principle that keeps you and Catherine</p>
<p class="p1">apart. Will you spoil two lives by your pride? Your hesitation between</p>
<p class="p1">inclination and prejudice, weakens you and destroys her.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“‘Prejudices,’ dear madam! Well, I suppose they are prejudices, but just</p>
<p class="p1">think of the horror of having Carl Kavanagh, the farm laborer, for a</p>
<p class="p1">brother-in-law, and being called ‘uncle’ by his ragged progeny!”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Oh, Archer, your inhumanity shocks me—they are human creatures, after</p>
<p class="p1">all—this Carl and his family.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“And don’t you see besides, madam, that if I should marry Catherine, and</p>
<p class="p1">introduce her into society, the first question would be, ‘Who is she?’</p>
<p class="p1">and the answer by some good-natured friend, ‘The sister of one of his</p>
<p class="p1">farm-laborers,’ would expose us to contempt, if it did not rule us out</p>
<p class="p1">of good company.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Archer! Archer! can it be that you weigh these falsities with the deep</p>
<p class="p1">realities of life?”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“It is a deplorable thing, indeed, that a girl of such noble nature</p>
<p class="p1">should come of such ignoble parentage.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“No! it is a congratulatory thing!—or would be so, if it were not such a</p>
<p class="p1">usual thing! Archer, you will find more moral worth, and it may be more</p>
<p class="p1">mental worth, among the so-called lower classes, than among the higher;</p>
<p class="p1">for instance, among the men, look at some of their brows, of Shaksperian</p>
<p class="p1">height and breadth—think what they would be with cultivation! And I tell</p>
<p class="p1">you, with all their disadvantages, the lower classes will give to our</p>
<p class="p1">republic the greatest of her future great men.”[2]</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Footnote 2:</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The history of most prominent men of the day verifies the prediction.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Major Clifton remained in deep thought for awhile, and then taking the</p>
<p class="p1">hand of the lady, said—</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“My dear mother, the objections that I have advanced are those that have</p>
<p class="p1">arisen in my mind, from time to time, giving me much pain. I wished to</p>
<p class="p1">hold them up before myself, as I have just done, in order to see what</p>
<p class="p1">they really consisted of, and looked like. I have seen the worst of</p>
<p class="p1">them, and in their ugliest light, and they will not deter me from taking</p>
<p class="p1">to my heart the girl I love. I have weighed them, and the whole mass is</p>
<p class="p1">light in the balance with my need of Catherine. I will marry her. I will</p>
<p class="p1">go and tell her so now. And the ceremony shall be performed whenever you</p>
<p class="p1">think proper.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Whenever _Kate_ thinks proper, my dear Archer,” replied the lady,</p>
<p class="p1">smiling.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">At this moment a servant entered and delivered a note to Major Clifton.</p>
<p class="p1">It was from Mrs. Georgia, announcing her return to White Cliffs, and</p>
<p class="p1">begging the company of Major Clifton to tea that evening.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">                              </span>CHAPTER XXX.</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">                               </span>BETROTHAL.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">               </span>Twas thy high purity of soul,</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">                 </span>Thy thought revealing eye,</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">               </span>That conquered all my pride of heart,</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">                 </span>Thou wanderer from the sky.—W. G. CLARK.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Major Clifton held the note between his finger and thumb, in a fit of</p>
<p class="p1">abstraction, while a pleasant, contemplative smile dwelt on his face.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Well, are you not going to answer it?” asked Mrs. Clifton, adding, “The</p>
<p class="p1">servant waits.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Oh! answer it! yes! what is it about?” he exclaimed, starting out of</p>
<p class="p1">his reverie, and glancing at the note again. Then he arose, penned a</p>
<p class="p1">hasty excuse, and delivering it to the messenger, dispatched him.</p>
<p class="p1">Returning from this business, he said, “No, I cannot leave home this</p>
<p class="p1">evening; since I have come to a decision, I wish to have a good,</p>
<p class="p1">confidential talk with my little Kate. How much I have to say to her,</p>
<p class="p1">how much to draw from her, if I can. What a prison delivery of thought</p>
<p class="p1">and emotion it must be on both sides, if I can get her to talk! But she</p>
<p class="p1">is so shy, except when under some strong, disinterested feeling for</p>
<p class="p1">another. Move her sympathies, and she forgets herself and loses all</p>
<p class="p1">reserve, otherwise—she is so shy.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Yes, very, very shy, _to you_. Kate’s heart and brain are sealed</p>
<p class="p1">volumes to you. It will require the easy intimacy of long, domestic</p>
<p class="p1">companionship, to find out all her excellencies. Her husband will love</p>
<p class="p1">and esteem her far more dearly and highly than ever lover has done—but</p>
<p class="p1">hush, here she comes.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">The door opened, and Catherine entered, from her morning’s household</p>
<p class="p1">duties, with her little basket of keys hanging on her arm.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Come hither, dear Kate,” said Major Clifton, holding out his hand.</p>
<p class="p1">Catherine put her little basket in its place, and quietly went to his</p>
<p class="p1">side. He encircled her waist with his arm, and holding both her hands</p>
<p class="p1">captive in his own, looked fondly in her face till she dropped her eyes</p>
<p class="p1">in confusion, and then he said, “Dear Kate, my mother here, who loves</p>
<p class="p1">you almost as much as I do, if that were possible, wants to know when</p>
<p class="p1">you will make us both happy, by becoming my wife and her daughter.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">He paused for an answer, never removing his eyes from their gaze upon</p>
<p class="p1">her glowing cheek.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Yes, I am very anxious to know what day you will give yourself to us</p>
<p class="p1">entirely, dear child!” said Mrs. Clifton, and she also paused for a</p>
<p class="p1">reply.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Catherine, in extreme confusion, glanced from one to the other, and</p>
<p class="p1">finally dropped her eyes again.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Come, dearest Kate, it is but a word—the name of some day in the week</p>
<p class="p1">whispered very low,” said Major Clifton, in her ear.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Yes, let it be soon; let it be within a week, dear child. My time is</p>
<p class="p1">short, Kate, and I wish to bless your marriage before I go hence. You</p>
<p class="p1">know I told you that I could calculate the progress of decay, and the</p>
<p class="p1">length of life with some accuracy, and I tell you now that my days are</p>
<p class="p1">numbered.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Come, Kate, if you cannot speak, give me one of your short, quick nods.</p>
<p class="p1">Come, this is Saturday—shall we be married to-morrow?—next</p>
<p class="p1">day?—Tuesday?—Wednesday?—Thursday?” Catherine, whose heart had been</p>
<p class="p1">filling all this time, now burst into tears. He drew her head upon his</p>
<p class="p1">shoulder, where she sobbed awhile, until he stooped and whispered, “Dear</p>
<p class="p1">Catherine, try to calm yourself—do you not see how you excite our</p>
<p class="p1">mother? there, lift up your head, and go to her; and both of you</p>
<p class="p1">together arrange all these little matters as mother and daughter should,</p>
<p class="p1">and she will let me know the result,” and tenderly withdrawing his arm,</p>
<p class="p1">he passed her round before him, and stood her beside Mrs. Clifton’s</p>
<p class="p1">easy-chair, and arose and took his hat and left the room, with the same</p>
<p class="p1">happy, half-contemplative smile upon his lips. Kate sank down by the</p>
<p class="p1">side of Mrs. Clifton, and dropping her head upon the lady’s lap, wept</p>
<p class="p1">afresh. The gentle invalid put her hands upon the maiden’s shoulders</p>
<p class="p1">caressingly, but did not seek to arrest the current of her emotion. It</p>
<p class="p1">was plain that the girl herself sought to stay her tears, for, between</p>
<p class="p1">her sobs, she exclaimed—</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Forgive—excuse—I know it’s weak, wrong—it is only because—I’m so</p>
<p class="p1">grateful!”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">The fit of emotion exhausted itself, and she lifted up her face, wiped</p>
<p class="p1">her eyes, and said—</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Lady—”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Call me mother, Kate.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Mother! heart’s dearest mother! do you think he mistook me?”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“How, Kate?”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“I couldn’t speak! Indeed, indeed I could not! But I want you to tell</p>
<p class="p1">him, _mother_, how grateful I am, and how happy! Tell him, _for I never</p>
<p class="p1">can_, how much and how long I have loved him. My heart has been single</p>
<p class="p1">to him ever since I first knew him. I will try to make him a good</p>
<p class="p1">wife—indeed, indeed I will. And where my weakness or my ignorance fails,</p>
<p class="p1">I will pray to Heaven daily for more strength and light. Oh! I know what</p>
<p class="p1">a sacrifice of pride and prejudice he has made for love of me—tell him</p>
<p class="p1">so, mother, and tell him—”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“No, dear Kate, I will not tell him that. He has made no sacrifice.</p>
<p class="p1">Nonsense. And if he had, you are worth it all, all—his wealth, rank,</p>
<p class="p1">position, pride and all! Be true to yourself.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Oh, what am I, that he should indeed prefer me to all the ladies in the</p>
<p class="p1">great city that he has left; and what can I bring him but my love and my</p>
<p class="p1">duty—all my love and all my duty!”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“And do you undervalue these, Kate? Why, they are the treasures of</p>
<p class="p1">treasures. And you would judge them so in another’s case. But here you</p>
<p class="p1">are fond and blind. Now, dearest Kate, I am so anxious to see you the</p>
<p class="p1">wife of Archer. And I wish to enjoy that pleasure as long as I can—when</p>
<p class="p1">shall it be?”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Mother, you and he have made me what I am, and given to my life all its</p>
<p class="p1">worth and value—now what can I do but give back myself and life to you?</p>
<p class="p1">Dearest mother, fix it as you will, I shall be happy, any way.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Thursday, Kate?”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Yes, Thursday, dear mother.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">The lady then embraced and dismissed her, and settled herself back in</p>
<p class="p1">her chair to take a necessary nap.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Catherine left the parlor in that half-blissful, half-fearful trance</p>
<p class="p1">that falls upon one when the great life’s desire and hope is about to be</p>
<p class="p1">realized—happy beyond measure, but somewhat incredulous that this could</p>
<p class="p1">be really fact—really the “sober certainty of waking bliss,” and no</p>
<p class="p1">dream, and foreboding some stroke of fate that should snatch the too</p>
<p class="p1">great joy from her. Major Clifton was standing within the open front</p>
<p class="p1">door, looking out upon the glorious autumn landscape and the changing</p>
<p class="p1">foliage of the trees, some of the outer branches of the latter burning</p>
<p class="p1">so red that they seemed a-fire in the rays of the afternoon sun. But he</p>
<p class="p1">turned to Catherine, with a buoyant smile and step, and led her out upon</p>
<p class="p1">the piazza. The habitually grave Archer Clifton was almost gay. He was</p>
<p class="p1">in that happy state of mind that all will recognize who have ever had a</p>
<p class="p1">severe, long standing moral conflict brought to end, in which the</p>
<p class="p1">reason, conscience and heart are all satisfied. The struggle between the</p>
<p class="p1">prejudices of rank and the passion of his soul was over, and the</p>
<p class="p1">strongest had conquered, and now reigned alone, and a fine, vigorous,</p>
<p class="p1">healthful joyousness had taken the place of all reserve and gloom and</p>
<p class="p1">eccentricity; so great and happy was this change, that Catherine felt no</p>
<p class="p1">more the strange, shy fear of him that had ever placed her at such</p>
<p class="p1">disadvantage in his presence. He led her to a shaded seat at the end of</p>
<p class="p1">a piazza, where there were no intruders but a glancing line of sunlight,</p>
<p class="p1">and nothing to disturb them louder than the rustle of a falling leaf.</p>
<p class="p1">And there he poured out the long hoarded mysteries of his heart, talking</p>
<p class="p1">on and on as the hours passed, until successively the sun went down, and</p>
<p class="p1">the stars came out, and clouds arose and hid them, and shrouded the</p>
<p class="p1">piazza in darkness. And still he talked—“an’ he would talk his last,”</p>
<p class="p1">not even heeding the approach of a servant, until Henny’s voice was</p>
<p class="p1">heard, asking Miss Kate to come and give out tea and sugar for supper.</p>
<p class="p1">Then he arose, and half unmindful of the presence of the maid, he said—</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“This is very sweet, dear Kate, very, very sweet—to be able to say to</p>
<p class="p1">you everything without reserve—to tell you all the long withheld secrets</p>
<p class="p1">of my soul, and see you listen with such deep interest; but when will</p>
<p class="p1">you be equally frank with me—when will you show me your heart?”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">The next day Major Clifton rode over to White Cliffs to pay his respects</p>
<p class="p1">to Georgia.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">The beauty received him with unrestrained joy; but in the conversation</p>
<p class="p1">that ensued, reverted to what she called “The intrigues of that low born</p>
<p class="p1">manœuverer, Miss Kavanagh,” asking him if he had not observed a great</p>
<p class="p1">change in Mrs. Clifton, ascribable entirely to her influence?</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">It gave Major Clifton great pain to hear Catherine traduced in this</p>
<p class="p1">manner, but he believed Mrs. Georgia to be perfectly sincere in her</p>
<p class="p1">opinion, and only the victim of a mistake. He told the lady so, adding—</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“I am about to give Miss Kavanagh the highest proof of confidence that</p>
<p class="p1">one being can give another. I am about to take her for my life’s bosom</p>
<p class="p1">friend. We shall be married in five days.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Had a bullet sped through her heart, she could not have given a more</p>
<p class="p1">agonized bound. Then she struck both hands to her temples, started</p>
<p class="p1">hastily half across the floor, paused again as if distracted, and</p>
<p class="p1">suddenly cried out—</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“You shall not do it! By my soul, you shall not do it! You never, never</p>
<p class="p1">shall become the dupe of that woman! I have entered the lists with her.</p>
<p class="p1">I mean, that to save you, I have done so, and before I leave them, I</p>
<p class="p1">will prove her false and treacherous. God show the right!”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Major Clifton gazed upon her in wonder. The strong emotion that she had</p>
<p class="p1">exhibited, imposed upon him, for there was no doubting its _reality_;</p>
<p class="p1">and far from suspecting its _cause_, an unhallowed passion for himself,</p>
<p class="p1">he ascribed it solely to her strong conviction of Catherine’s</p>
<p class="p1">unworthiness, and to her disinterested regard for his own welfare. And</p>
<p class="p1">when she came and threw herself upon the sofa beside him, and besought,</p>
<p class="p1">with all the eloquence that passion and the demon could lend her, that</p>
<p class="p1">he would pause and not hurry on to his ruin, his confidence in</p>
<p class="p1">Catherine’s integrity was shaken to the foundation. And when at the end</p>
<p class="p1">of an hour he rode home, he reached Hardbargain as miserable as the</p>
<p class="p1">doubt of one beloved can make a man. If love has the Divine power of</p>
<p class="p1">transfiguring its object until faults are excellencies, suspicion</p>
<p class="p1">possesses the demoniac faculty of deforming its victim until virtues</p>
<p class="p1">seem vices, and under its influence the highest and best gifts of the</p>
<p class="p1">maiden, her intellect, virtues, and graces were turned against her; her</p>
<p class="p1">talent seemed intriguing art; her meekness and humility became meanness</p>
<p class="p1">and sycophancy; her piety, hypocrisy; and her girlish shyness the</p>
<p class="p1">sinister reserve of conscious guilt.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">It was well that on his return he met Catherine only in his mother’s</p>
<p class="p1">presence, where deep regard for the lady constrained him into something</p>
<p class="p1">like forbearance; though even then his moody manner excited some</p>
<p class="p1">uneasiness in the bosoms of the two ladies. When Catherine left the room</p>
<p class="p1">to order dinner, the conversation that ensued tended to strengthen his</p>
<p class="p1">newly revived suspicions. Mrs. Clifton told him, that with his consent</p>
<p class="p1">she would like to leave the farm of Hardbargain to Catherine, as a</p>
<p class="p1">testimony of her esteem and affection.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“And for a more practical reason, too,” she said, “for you know, my dear</p>
<p class="p1">Archer, that the estate of White Cliffs being entailed—if you should die</p>
<p class="p1">before her, and without male children—Catherine and her daughters, if</p>
<p class="p1">she should have any, would be left homeless. But if I leave her this</p>
<p class="p1">farm of Hardbargain, it can make no difference to you during your life,</p>
<p class="p1">and if Catherine happen to survive you, it will secure her a home. What</p>
<p class="p1">do you think of this plan, Archer? You look grave and troubled. If you</p>
<p class="p1">have the slightest objection, I will not carry it out, of course.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Surely I have not the least right to object, my dear mother; your</p>
<p class="p1">property you have made by your own labor, and improved by your own</p>
<p class="p1">admirable management.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“You have the right of nature, my dear Archer; and I see by your</p>
<p class="p1">gravity, that you dislike this arrangement; therefore it shall not be</p>
<p class="p1">made.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“You mistake my thoughtfulness, dear madam. If I am somewhat grave, it</p>
<p class="p1">is upon another subject. Believe me, I have not the slightest fault to</p>
<p class="p1">find with this plan; _neither does it take me by surprise, I have been</p>
<p class="p1">prepared for it months since_. Mrs. Georgia Clifton informed me that</p>
<p class="p1">such was your intention.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Is it possible? How could Georgia have known anything about it? But I</p>
<p class="p1">suppose she has heard me drop words to that effect. May I hope then,</p>
<p class="p1">that this purpose meets your approbation, Archer?”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Certainly, madam, it can make no material difference, if Kate is to be</p>
<p class="p1">my wife. And, if she were not to be so, I should be quite as well</p>
<p class="p1">pleased.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Unconscious of the double meaning of his words, the lady then inquired</p>
<p class="p1">into the cause of his gloom.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Merely a fit of moodiness, dear mother; the reaction, perhaps, of</p>
<p class="p1">yesterday’s joy; a mere depression of spirits, which a brisk gallop over</p>
<p class="p1">the hills will throw off.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“If you are inclined for a ride, Archer, you can do me a service at the</p>
<p class="p1">same time, if you will go to L—— and bring out Mr. White, the lawyer, to</p>
<p class="p1">draw up my will.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">A spasm of pain passed over the handsome countenance of Major Clifton,</p>
<p class="p1">and he said—</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“I will do anything you please, dearest mother; but surely there is no</p>
<p class="p1">necessity for haste in this matter.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Archer, _there is_. Besides, my mind will be easier when it is done.</p>
<p class="p1">And Archer, lastly—bring with you a clergyman. I wish to receive the</p>
<p class="p1">Holy Communion.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Major Clifton made no farther objection, but left the room to order his</p>
<p class="p1">horse; and in less than half an hour he found himself on his way to L——.</p>
<p class="p1">Mrs. Clifton summoned Kate. When the girl entered, she found the lady on</p>
<p class="p1">the verge of fainting from over-exertion and extreme weakness. Catherine</p>
<p class="p1">grew pale with sudden fear, and her hands trembled as she poured out and</p>
<p class="p1">administered a restorative. Somewhat revived by the cordial, Mrs.</p>
<p class="p1">Clifton said—</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Kate, write two notes, one to Mrs. Georgia Clifton, and one to your</p>
<p class="p1">brother Carl, asking each of them to come here this evening to witness a</p>
<p class="p1">deed—or rather _two of them_, my dear Kate—the signing of my last will</p>
<p class="p1">and testament, and the solemnization of your marriage—for both must be</p>
<p class="p1">hastened, Kate. My dear child, take your pen and write at once.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Deeply troubled, extremely agitated, yet struggling to govern her</p>
<p class="p1">feelings, Catherine found the writing materials and penned the two</p>
<p class="p1">notes; but when she had finished them, in the abstraction of her great</p>
<p class="p1">grief, she misdirected them—and sent the note intended for Mrs. Georgia</p>
<p class="p1">to Carl Kavanagh, and that intended for Carl to Mrs. Georgia. When she</p>
<p class="p1">had dispatched these notes by different messengers, and returned to the</p>
<p class="p1">parlor, Mrs. Clifton said—</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Call Henny, my dear Kate, and let her assist you in getting me up</p>
<p class="p1">stairs. It has come at last, Kate.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Almost dismayed by sorrow, Catherine rung the bell that brought the</p>
<p class="p1">servants into the room. And between them they raised the lady to her</p>
<p class="p1">feet. Mrs. Clifton took a long look around the room, as though she were</p>
<p class="p1">taking a last leave of every dear familiar object in it; and then</p>
<p class="p1">suffered herself to be supported up to her chamber.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">                  </span>* <span class="Apple-converted-space">      </span>* <span class="Apple-converted-space">      </span>* <span class="Apple-converted-space">      </span>* <span class="Apple-converted-space">      </span>*</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Mrs. Georgia Clifton was pacing her chamber floor, in all the</p>
<p class="p1">distraction of excited evil passions, racking her brain for an expedient</p>
<p class="p1">to ruin her rival and break off the impending marriage, when the</p>
<p class="p1">“spirits that tend on mortal thoughts,” furnished her with one. A</p>
<p class="p1">messenger entered and handed her a sealed envelope, directed in the</p>
<p class="p1">hand-writing of Catherine Kavanagh. She opened it in surprise,</p>
<p class="p1">curiosity, and even in some degree of vague, guilty fear, and found</p>
<p class="p1">within the misdirected note of Kate to Carl. It read simply as follows:</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“DEAR CARL:—</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Mrs. Clifton is almost dying. She says you must come to the house</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>this afternoon, at four o’clock, to meet a lawyer and a clergyman, and</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>with Mrs. Georgia Clifton, to witness the signing of her last will,</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>and also my marriage. Do not keep her waiting.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">                                                            </span>“CATHERINE.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">This note contained no expression of esteem or affection for the</p>
<p class="p1">invalid, or regret at her approaching death. No! for Catherine’s</p>
<p class="p1">veneration and sorrow were too earnest, too real, to be a matter of</p>
<p class="p1">wordy formula. But in the evil heart of Georgia this simplicity was</p>
<p class="p1">turned against the girl. And her first idea, revealed in her smile of</p>
<p class="p1">satisfaction, was to show this mis-sent note to Archer Clifton, and bid</p>
<p class="p1">him look and see with what perfect coolness and indifference the writer</p>
<p class="p1">could announce the approaching demise of her benefactress. But while</p>
<p class="p1">this thought was revolving in her mind, Satan suggested a surer plan—a</p>
<p class="p1">deadly stratagem. And at this inspiration of the fiend, the dark face of</p>
<p class="p1">the baleful woman lighted up with demoniac joy. She seized the note</p>
<p class="p1">again, and rushed to the window, and scanned the hand-writing. Georgia</p>
<p class="p1">inherited all the imitative talent of her father, the portrait painter.</p>
<p class="p1">Catherine’s hand-writing was unique: small, square letters, with heavy</p>
<p class="p1">strokes, a chirography peculiar to herself, yet easily imitated. Mrs.</p>
<p class="p1">Georgia copied a few selected words—compared them with the originals,</p>
<p class="p1">and was satisfied with her work. Next she wished to procure note paper,</p>
<p class="p1">exactly like it. Catherine’s note was written upon neutral-tinted paper,</p>
<p class="p1">that had been given her by Major Clifton. Mrs. Georgia recognized it as</p>
<p class="p1">some that had belonged to him. She thought there might possibly be a few</p>
<p class="p1">stray sheets in the writing-table of the library. She went thither, and</p>
<p class="p1">after a diligent search, found a single sheet. This she took with her,</p>
<p class="p1">and returned to her chamber, locked herself in, and sat down to her</p>
<p class="p1">fiendish task. Perfectly imitating the hand-writing of Catherine, she</p>
<p class="p1">forged the following letter:</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“DEAREST CARL:—</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“My long slavery is almost over. The old woman is at her last gasp,</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>and wants you to come over this afternoon at four o’clock, to witness</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>her will and my marriage. You see I have succeeded in catching the</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>aristocrat, and in wheedling his mother into giving me Hardbargain, in</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>my sole right. Am I not a triumphant diplomatist? When she is dead,</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>and I am married, and mistress of White Cliffs and of Hardbargain, as</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I shall probably reside at the principal seat, I intend to let you</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>this farm, on the easiest terms. Never fear Major Clifton’s</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>interference. You know _I_ know how to manage him.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">                                                            </span>“CATHERINE.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">When she had completed her demon-work, Georgia carefully examined it. It</p>
<p class="p1">satisfied her. She smiled, and muttered—“_Any one_ who ever saw</p>
<p class="p1">Catherine’s queer hand-writing, would feel safe in swearing this to be</p>
<p class="p1">hers.” Then she folded it in the form of the other note, and placed it</p>
<p class="p1">in the original envelope—and threw it, broken-sealed as it was, upon the</p>
<p class="p1">table, exclaiming—“There!—</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">                </span>“‘I have set my life upon a cast,</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">                </span>And will abide the hazard of the die.’”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">                  </span>* <span class="Apple-converted-space">      </span>* <span class="Apple-converted-space">      </span>* <span class="Apple-converted-space">      </span>* <span class="Apple-converted-space">      </span>*</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">In the meanwhile, Catherine watched by the bedside of Mrs. Clifton,</p>
<p class="p1">awaiting the return of Major Clifton, with the clergyman and the</p>
<p class="p1">attorney.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">About three o’clock in the afternoon the party arrived. The professional</p>
<p class="p1">gentlemen remained in the parlor, while Major Clifton went up into the</p>
<p class="p1">chamber of his mother. As he approached her bed, and perceived the</p>
<p class="p1">fearful change a few hours had wrought in her appearance, and recognized</p>
<p class="p1">the sure approach of death, he was so shocked, so overwhelmed with</p>
<p class="p1">sorrow, that it was with the utmost difficulty he could sustain his</p>
<p class="p1">self-command.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">She held out to him her wasted hand, saying, quietly—</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“My dear Archer, I wish to have the marriage ceremony between you and</p>
<p class="p1">Kate performed this afternoon, if you please.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Certainly, my dear mother, it shall be as you desire,” he replied,</p>
<p class="p1">repressing a great groan—but desirous, above all things, to gratify that</p>
<p class="p1">dying parent. “Shall it be _now_, mother?”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“No, dear Archer, not just yet—I want the holiest things left for the</p>
<p class="p1">_last_—I want the will drawn up, witnessed, signed and sealed _first_;</p>
<p class="p1">then the marriage ceremony performed; and last, I wish to receive the</p>
<p class="p1">Holy Communion—after which, I shall be ready to depart.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Mother—the minister and the lawyer are below stairs, awaiting your</p>
<p class="p1">leisure—they will remain over to-night. Do not disturb yourself.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“My good Archer, I made Catherine write to Carl Kavanagh and to Mrs.</p>
<p class="p1">Georgia to come to see me this afternoon, they have not yet arrived.</p>
<p class="p1">Please go and send again for them.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Archer Clifton bent and kissed his mother’s forehead, and went down</p>
<p class="p1">stairs. In the hall he saw Carl Kavanagh, hat in hand, waiting.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Carl immediately advanced, and said—</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Ah! Major Clifton, I am waiting here to see my sister to return to her</p>
<p class="p1">this note, that she has sent me by mistake I think—perhaps you can</p>
<p class="p1">explain it.” And he handed to Archer Clifton the mis-sent note of</p>
<p class="p1">Catherine to Georgia.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Major Clifton understood the mistake at once, and retaining the note,</p>
<p class="p1">replied—</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Catherine wrote two notes, summoning yourself and Mrs. Georgia Clifton</p>
<p class="p1">to Hardbargain, this afternoon, to witness the signature of a certain</p>
<p class="p1">document. She placed them in envelopes, and in her haste misdirected</p>
<p class="p1">them—that is all. Pray remain here, while I ride over home, and bring</p>
<p class="p1">Mrs. Georgia.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Carl Kavanagh sat down in the hall, and Major Clifton mounted a fresh</p>
<p class="p1">horse, and galloped over to White Cliffs. Dismounting at the gate, he</p>
<p class="p1">threw the reins to a servant and entering the house, sent a message to</p>
<p class="p1">Mrs. Georgia.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">The servant returned, and requesting Major Clifton to follow, led the</p>
<p class="p1">way up to Mrs. Georgia’s own room, opened the door, announced the</p>
<p class="p1">visitor, and retired.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Archer entered the room, and found the lady seated at her work-table,</p>
<p class="p1">but looking pale and anxious. By her work-box lay the envelope of Kate’s</p>
<p class="p1">true note with the forged note in it.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Ah!” said Major Clifton, after greeting her, “I see that you have</p>
<p class="p1">received Kate’s note.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Yes—one that was never intended for _my_ eyes, but of those of a fellow</p>
<p class="p1">conspirator.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Conspirator, madam!”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Yes, sir. Do you surmise all the consequences of these mis-sent</p>
<p class="p1">letters? Look at this!” she said, throwing it to him, “written by Miss</p>
<p class="p1">Kavanagh, but directed by mistake to me. Yes, look at it! Examine the</p>
<p class="p1">envelope! and then read the contents of the note!”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Major Clifton glanced at the superscription, opened the note, and read</p>
<p class="p1">it through with a cheek growing pale and paler—until he finished it—then</p>
<p class="p1">tossed it from him, and burying his face in his hands groaned aloud. He</p>
<p class="p1">had not the slightest suspicion that the infamous letter was a</p>
<p class="p1">forgery—no!—he had not a single merciful doubt that it was the work of</p>
<p class="p1">Catherine—nay, he would have sworn to the hand-writing, if called upon</p>
<p class="p1">to do so in a court of justice—he would have sworn to it though Kate’s</p>
<p class="p1">life hung upon his oath! Any one else who had ever seen her peculiar</p>
<p class="p1">chirography would have felt constrained to do so, if requested—save</p>
<p class="p1">two—she who lay dying at Hardbargain—and she was to know nothing about</p>
<p class="p1">it—and he, the rejected lover, now far away, who would have cast that</p>
<p class="p1">note aside in high disdain, and staked his honor on her truth. Clifton</p>
<p class="p1">groaned aloud, in the bitterness of disappointed esteem. Resentment</p>
<p class="p1">itself was swallowed up in sorrow, and he exclaimed—</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Oh! would to God she had died, or _I_ had, before I knew this!”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Rejoice, rather, that you are saved!”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“_Saved_, madam!”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Yes—_saved_. You will never marry her, now. You are perfectly</p>
<p class="p1">justifiable in breaking with the unmasked traitress!”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“And in shaking the last few sands in my mother’s glass of life. The</p>
<p class="p1">discovery of that girl’s treachery has driven me to despair—it would</p>
<p class="p1">kill my mother! No, lady! I must marry her, that my beloved mother may</p>
<p class="p1">depart in peace.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Marry her!” screamed Georgia, with the cry of a wounded hyena—“marry</p>
<p class="p1">her, and sacrifice all your hopes of happiness, for the sake of keeping</p>
<p class="p1">quiet the last few hours of a dying woman! You will not do such a</p>
<p class="p1">thing.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“My hopes of happiness, did you say, Mrs. Clifton? Ah, lady, can you not</p>
<p class="p1">comprehend, then, that when one at my age has discovered—beyond all</p>
<p class="p1">possibility of doubt—the total unworthiness of one the most beloved on</p>
<p class="p1">earth—the heart’s most cherished darling—the life’s dearest hope—” down</p>
<p class="p1">broke his voice, and down dropped his head upon his hands—then rising,</p>
<p class="p1">impatiently, he exclaimed—“I say, can you not comprehend that I have</p>
<p class="p1">_no_ hopes of happiness left? I loved her so! I trusted her so! I</p>
<p class="p1">sacrificed such strong prejudices for her! And I was as happy as a</p>
<p class="p1">converted sinner, when the struggle was over and the sacrifice made. I</p>
<p class="p1">could have shaken hands with her freckled-handed brother, and claimed</p>
<p class="p1">kindred with all his rugged race! And now!—I am unmanned! I am a fool!”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“No, you are not, unless you marry her. You are not the first</p>
<p class="p1">noble-minded man that has been duped by a bad woman! You feel it as</p>
<p class="p1">every generous hearted man would. But it will pass. Life has many</p>
<p class="p1">chances, and you will be happy yet. _My_ friendship is not much,</p>
<p class="p1">perhaps, but is it not something?”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Yes—yes—yes—yes—sweet friend, it is much,” said Archer Clifton,</p>
<p class="p1">slowly—half soliloquizing, as he took and held her hand. Then suddenly</p>
<p class="p1">starting, as out of a reverie, he exclaimed—“Mrs. Clifton, you know my</p>
<p class="p1">errand here—it is to bring you over to Hardbargain, for the purpose of</p>
<p class="p1">which you have already been advised by the note.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“To be present at your mad marriage, among other things?”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Yes.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“I will not go! I cannot! I cannot witness such a sacrifice.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“As you please, dear Georgia. I suppose there is no imperative necessity</p>
<p class="p1">of your doing so—good-bye!” and he arose, and lifted his hat from the</p>
<p class="p1">table.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Yes! good-bye, indeed!” replied Georgia, bitterly—“good-bye, indeed! if</p>
<p class="p1">you persist in your insane purpose!—I shall remain here, and hope to the</p>
<p class="p1">last. But when I hear that this marriage has really taken place, I leave</p>
<p class="p1">White Cliffs within the hour!”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“You will think differently, dear lady, and I shall see you again,</p>
<p class="p1">shortly.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Never!—as the husband of that traitress.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">He did not reply. He raised her hand to his lips, and left her.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Left to herself, mad impulses seized the disappointed woman. At one</p>
<p class="p1">instant she was impelled to seize the forged letter, and rush to the</p>
<p class="p1">death-bed of Mrs. Clifton, and there denounce her favorite as a</p>
<p class="p1">hypocrite and a traitress. But a moment’s reflection convinced her that</p>
<p class="p1">no art of hers could induce the dying woman to think evil of the</p>
<p class="p1">excellent girl she herself had educated. That on the contrary, such a</p>
<p class="p1">step might possibly result in her own signal defeat and exposure, and</p>
<p class="p1">the everlasting anger and contempt of Archer Clifton. Her brain was</p>
<p class="p1">beginning to reel, and her self-confidence to wane. In sudden fear she</p>
<p class="p1">looked around for the forged letter, intending to burn it. It was</p>
<p class="p1">nowhere to be seen. Then she recollected that Major Clifton had, on</p>
<p class="p1">departing, picked it up, and put it in his pocket. And sick with</p>
<p class="p1">disappointed love, jealousy, hatred, and fear, she tottered towards a</p>
<p class="p1">lounge, but ere she reached it, fell upon the floor. In the meanwhile,</p>
<p class="p1">Major Clifton, riding at full speed, reached the farm-house.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">On reaching Hardbargain, Major Clifton went immediately to Mrs.</p>
<p class="p1">Clifton’s chamber. He found her still sinking. She inquired, in a faint</p>
<p class="p1">voice, whether he had brought Mrs. Georgia. He replied, with perhaps a</p>
<p class="p1">pardonable ambiguity of speech, that Mrs. Georgia was too much</p>
<p class="p1">_indisposed_ to attend. Then she said that she supposed Mr. White (the</p>
<p class="p1">clergyman) would consent to act in her stead. She informed him that the</p>
<p class="p1">attorney had been with her, and had drawn up her will according to her</p>
<p class="p1">instruction, and she requested that the parties might be assembled in</p>
<p class="p1">her room to witness the signing. Major Clifton left the chamber to</p>
<p class="p1">summon them, and soon returned, accompanied by the lawyer, the minister,</p>
<p class="p1">Carl Kavanagh and Catherine. The will was then read, after which the</p>
<p class="p1">lady was raised up in bed, and supported in the arms of her son; the</p>
<p class="p1">document was placed upon a portfolio and laid before her, and a pen</p>
<p class="p1">dipped in ink and presented to her. She signed her name, and immediately</p>
<p class="p1">sank back exhausted. The two witnesses affixed their signatures, and the</p>
<p class="p1">will was delivered into the custody of the attorney. A restorative was</p>
<p class="p1">administered to the invalid, and she was arranged comfortably upon her</p>
<p class="p1">pillows. Then she took the hand of her son, and whispered—</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Let the marriage ceremony be performed at once, dearest Archer.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">He pressed that wan hand, laid it tenderly down upon the coverlet, and</p>
<p class="p1">spoke apart with the clergyman, who occupied the chair beside the head</p>
<p class="p1">of the bed. The minister solemnly arose, drew a prayer-book from his</p>
<p class="p1">pocket and opened it. Major Clifton went quietly and spoke a few words</p>
<p class="p1">in explanation to the lawyer and Carl Kavanagh, who then approached the</p>
<p class="p1">bedside. Lastly, he took the hand of Catherine, and led her up before</p>
<p class="p1">the minister. The marriage ceremony commenced. It was performed</p>
<p class="p1">according to the ritual of the Protestant Episcopal Church. But when the</p>
<p class="p1">great question was put to the bridegroom—“Archer, ‘wilt thou have this</p>
<p class="p1">woman to be thy wedded wife, to live together, after God’s ordinance, in</p>
<p class="p1">the holy estate of matrimony? Wilt thou love her, comfort her, honor</p>
<p class="p1">her,’” etc.—instead of answering, according to the ritual, “I will,” he</p>
<p class="p1">replied by a grave and formal bow, with silent lips, “that scarce their</p>
<p class="p1">scorn forbore.” When the corresponding question was put to the bride,</p>
<p class="p1">Kate too replied by a gentle inclination of the head, but her true heart</p>
<p class="p1">responded sincerely, earnestly. When the last benediction was given, and</p>
<p class="p1">when, according to the old formula, the bridegroom was to salute his</p>
<p class="p1">bride, he merely touched her cheek with cold lips, and passed her on to</p>
<p class="p1">his mother, who held out her arms to embrace her daughter. The</p>
<p class="p1">singularity of Major Clifton’s manner was scarcely noticed, or it was</p>
<p class="p1">ascribed to the solemnity of the attending circumstances. Mrs. Clifton</p>
<p class="p1">now desired that all, with the exception of her son and daughter and the</p>
<p class="p1">clergyman, should bid her adieu and leave the room. Her request was</p>
<p class="p1">complied with, and when they had retired, she signified her wish to</p>
<p class="p1">partake of the Sacrament of the Lord’s Supper with her children. Major</p>
<p class="p1">Clifton was constrained to decline, upon conscientious scruples; for how</p>
<p class="p1">could he partake of the Sacrament of peace and brotherly love, with his</p>
<p class="p1">heart consumed with indignation against his newly-married bride?</p>
<p class="p1">Catherine, however, participated in the Holy Communion, while he looked</p>
<p class="p1">on with surprise, mixed with a degree of horror. When the sacred rite</p>
<p class="p1">was over, the minister of God took an affectionate leave, and departed.</p>
<p class="p1">When the minister was gone, and they were left alone together, the dying</p>
<p class="p1">mother beckoned her son and daughter to come and sit near her. They</p>
<p class="p1">obeyed her, and she addressed them a few words of earnest, affectionate</p>
<p class="p1">counsel, blessed them, and resigned herself to rest. Her eyelids closed</p>
<p class="p1">calmly, and her breathing was gentle and regular; they had to mark</p>
<p class="p1">attentively before they knew that it grew fainter and fainter. Once she</p>
<p class="p1">opened her eyes, and, smiling her old, reflecting smile, said—</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Dear Archer, I have often tried to detect the exact moment of falling</p>
<p class="p1">asleep. I watch now, to see if I can seize the precise instant of</p>
<p class="p1">passing from mortal to immortal life.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">And she closed her eyes again. After a few minutes, she said—</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Sing to me, dear Kate! You know—Heber’s death hymn.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Catherine bent and kissed the pallid lips of the dying woman, and then</p>
<p class="p1">her voice arose, sweet, clear and spiritual as angels’ songs, in that</p>
<p class="p1">immortal requiem—</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">                 </span>“Vital spark of heavenly flame,</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">                 </span>Quit, oh! quit this mortal frame;</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">                 </span>Trembling, hoping, lingering, flying,</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">                 </span>Oh! the pain, the bliss of dying—</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">                 </span>Hark! they whisper, angels say—</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">                 </span>Sister spirit, come away—</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">At the end of the first stanza, she murmured, faintly—</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Your voice, too, dear Archer.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">His voice arose now in unison with Catherine’s, and they sang the</p>
<p class="p1">remainder—</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">                 </span>“The world recedes—it disappears:</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">                 </span>Heaven opens on my eyes; my ears</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">                   </span>With sounds seraphic ring.</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">                 </span>Lend, lend your wings; I mount, I fly!</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">                 </span>Oh, grave, where is thy victory?</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">                   </span>Oh, death, where is thy sting?”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">They ceased, and looked upon the marble face before them. It was still</p>
<p class="p1">in death, but there remained upon the countenance the impress of the</p>
<p class="p1">ecstatic smile with which the spirit had taken its flight—</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">                            </span>“Her death</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">                </span>Was like the setting of a planet mild.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">                             </span>CHAPTER XXXI.</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">                           </span>THE POISON WORKS.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">                                       </span>’Tis slander;</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">           </span>Whose edge is sharper than the sword; whose tongue</p>

<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">When Archer Clifton saw that all indeed was over; when he looked upon</p>
<p class="p1">that mother-face, the first which had ever met his conscious gaze in</p>
<p class="p1">life; that old, familiar face, which seemed to him coeval with his</p>
<p class="p1">being, and a necessary part of it; that face the most intimate, the most</p>
<p class="p1">loving, the most faithful which had ever shone upon his path of</p>
<p class="p1">life;—and felt that it was lost forever; that the light of those quiet</p>
<p class="p1">eyes was darkened forever; the sound of that kind voice silenced</p>
<p class="p1">forever; the smile of those calm lips fled forever;—when he clasped that</p>
<p class="p1">mother-hand, and felt that those dear fingers would close upon his own</p>
<p class="p1">in cordial grasp never, never more;—oh! when he felt that all was over,</p>
<p class="p1">over, “finished, done and ended,” he fell upon his knees by the corpse,</p>
<p class="p1">dropped his head upon the cold, inanimate bosom, and broke into</p>
<p class="p1">convulsive sobs.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Weeping freely, Catherine knelt by his side, and put her arm around his</p>
<p class="p1">neck. He was unconscious of her presence, until, after giving way to</p>
<p class="p1">sorrow for a few moments, she lifted up her head, and wiped her eyes,</p>
<p class="p1">and controlling her own emotion, sought to console him—</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Do not grieve so, dear Archer,” she murmured, with her arm again around</p>
<p class="p1">him, “do not grieve, but _pray_.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Then indeed he suddenly grew calm, unclasped the gentle arm of Catherine</p>
<p class="p1">from his neck, arose slowly from his kneeling posture, took her hand,</p>
<p class="p1">and raised her upon her feet, and regarding her with a stern and</p>
<p class="p1">sorrowful countenance, said, in severe rebuke—</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Come! madam! no more hypocrisy now! None here at least! It is useless</p>
<p class="p1">hereafter! You have accomplished your design. You _are_ a ‘successful</p>
<p class="p1">diplomatist,’ and your ’long slavery’ _is_ now over.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Catherine lifted her eyes, dilated with sorrow and amazement, and fixed</p>
<p class="p1">them on his face an instant; but the look she met there, the expression</p>
<p class="p1">of mingled suffering and severity, such as might have sat upon the brow</p>
<p class="p1">of Brutus, when the feelings of the man and the duty of the judge strove</p>
<p class="p1">in his bosom, awed her into silence before him. She could express no</p>
<p class="p1">surprise or grief—ask no explanation. The old shyness and fear came over</p>
<p class="p1">her, and her eyes fell, and her cheeks paled. Again he spoke in the same</p>
<p class="p1">stern, sorrowful tone—</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Ay, cower with conscious guilt! You are discovered! And you should have</p>
<p class="p1">been unmasked before _her_ to-day, but that I did not wish to embitter</p>
<p class="p1">her last moments! that only saved you! Come! leave the room that you</p>
<p class="p1">desecrate with your presence! Leave me alone with my dead!”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">But instead of obeying, she stood like a statue before him.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Then he took her hand and led her through the door, and closed it behind</p>
<p class="p1">her.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Catherine stood there where he had placed her, amazed, confounded,</p>
<p class="p1">unable to move a step forward, until the thought of practical duties,</p>
<p class="p1">now pressing upon her, gave her strength, and she passed on to summon</p>
<p class="p1">those whose office it was to prepare the dead for burial. But amid all</p>
<p class="p1">the multifarious tasks that devolved upon her at that trying time, as</p>
<p class="p1">newly installed and unassisted mistress of the house, she could not for</p>
<p class="p1">an instant forget her awful bereavement, or the dreadful anger of her</p>
<p class="p1">husband.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">He came out of the room of death at last, and passed Catherine on the</p>
<p class="p1">stairs, and his stern, averted countenance at that moment almost broke</p>
<p class="p1">her heart. But she went on enduringly with her tasks. Often she raised</p>
<p class="p1">her soul in prayer to God for help. Once, during that desolate night,</p>
<p class="p1">she found time to open her Bible, and her eyes fell upon this text:</p>
<p class="p1">Romans, 8, 28. “And we know that all things work together for good, to</p>
<p class="p1">them that love God”—she paused upon the text, repeating, “‘all things,’</p>
<p class="p1">_all things_, even this! I will believe it!” And her face grew beautiful</p>
<p class="p1">with divine faith, and she reverently closed the book, and went on her</p>
<p class="p1">way comforted. She had need of fresh strength and comfort, indeed, to</p>
<p class="p1">meet a fresh trial. On coming down stairs she met Henny, who seemed to</p>
<p class="p1">be on the look out for her. and who placed a note in her hand. It was</p>
<p class="p1">from Major Clifton, and read as follows—</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“I desire that you keep your chamber to-morrow, or, at least, refrain</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>from insulting the memory of the dead, by appearing at the funeral.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">                                                        </span>ARCHER CLIFTON.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">She nodded her head slowly, meditatively, with a look of sweetest</p>
<p class="p1">resignation; then beckoned Henny to follow her, and returned to her</p>
<p class="p1">chamber. There she sat down and wrote the following note—</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“I will absent myself from the funeral, since you wish me to do so; I</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>will also keep my room, if you desire it, when I remind you that there</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>is no one to supply my place in the household arrangements for the</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>solemnities of the day.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">                                                            </span>“CATHERINE.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">She sent this by Henny, but received no reply to it. Construing silence</p>
<p class="p1">into consent, she went about the house as usual attending to her duties.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">In the meantime, Major Clifton sat in his study, awaiting an answer to a</p>
<p class="p1">note he had written to Mrs. Georgia, apprising her of the recent events,</p>
<p class="p1">and requesting her to come at once to the house. He had not to wait</p>
<p class="p1">long; his messenger returned, and informed him that he had met the lady</p>
<p class="p1">on her way to L——, to take the stage coach to Richmond. The man, at the</p>
<p class="p1">same time, gave the intelligence that Mr. Kavanagh waited in the hall,</p>
<p class="p1">to know if he could be of any service to Major Clifton on the present</p>
<p class="p1">occasion.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Show him in,” said Major Clifton.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">The man went out and soon returned, accompanied by Carl, whose face</p>
<p class="p1">expressed the most profound and sincere sympathy.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Set a chair for Mr. Kavanagh, and retire, James.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">The man obeyed, Carl seated himself, and in person repeated his</p>
<p class="p1">condolences, and his tenders of service.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">In reply, Major Clifton took from his pocket the forged note and laid it</p>
<p class="p1">before him, saying, coldly—</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“There is the note your sister wrote to you, and sent by mistake to Mrs.</p>
<p class="p1">Georgia Clifton. Read it.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Carl took it up, wondering what might be the use of reading it _now_,</p>
<p class="p1">but as he glanced over its contents, his eyes grew wide with</p>
<p class="p1">astonishment, and when he had finished it, he laid it down again,</p>
<p class="p1">exclaiming—</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“I am confounded!”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“I should think so, sir!” coldly remarked Major Clifton.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“She speaks of letting _me_ the farm! I never had the slightest desire</p>
<p class="p1">to rent the farm, and before I heard the will read, I had not even the</p>
<p class="p1">slightest idea that Mrs. Clifton designed to leave it to my sister!”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Ah! Really?” asked Mr. Clifton, ironically.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Really and truly, and sincerely and positively, I had not.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Tautological asseveration is no evidence. Why should she have written</p>
<p class="p1">to you thus if you had not?”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“How do I know, sir? I tell you I am amazed! And if I did not know,</p>
<p class="p1">beyond all possibility of doubt, the hand-writing to be Catherine’s, I</p>
<p class="p1">should say that she did not write, and that she never could have written</p>
<p class="p1">such a letter.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Which means plainly this, that if there did not exist the most positive</p>
<p class="p1">proof to the contrary, you would fain deny it,” sneered Major Clifton.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Yes, sir!” answered Carl, boldly. “If the proof positive to _my mind_,</p>
<p class="p1">as well as to your own did not exist, I _would_ deny it, and I _do_ deny</p>
<p class="p1">any personal agency or knowledge about it whatever! I say to you that I</p>
<p class="p1">am amazed! It is incomprehensible to me how Catherine could have</p>
<p class="p1">conceived, much less written such a letter! And above all things, it is</p>
<p class="p1">inexplicable how she should have written so disrespectfully of Mrs.</p>
<p class="p1">Clifton, whom she loved and venerated so much.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Or whom, for certain purposes, she _pretended_ to love and venerate so</p>
<p class="p1">much.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“She _did_, sir! She really _did_. She was sincere in her esteem and</p>
<p class="p1">affection. She was sincere in all things.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“I know she affected rare sincerity.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“It was no affectation, Major Clifton. I have known her from</p>
<p class="p1">childhood—it was truth. And I tell you, I scarcely believe my own eyes!</p>
<p class="p1">I scarcely believe that I am awake when I see that letter! I am</p>
<p class="p1">confounded!”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Well, sir!” said Major Clifton, sternly, his whole manner changing,</p>
<p class="p1">“_I_, at least am not so confounded as not to know that she never would</p>
<p class="p1">have written such a letter to you, had you not been the confidant of her</p>
<p class="p1">plans. And _you_ are not so confounded as to be ignorant, that, after</p>
<p class="p1">such a development, I am constrained to forbid you the house, and to</p>
<p class="p1">interdict all communication between your sister and yourself.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">There was something of Catherine’s own nobility in the manner of Carl’s</p>
<p class="p1">reply. He stood a moment with his forehead thrown back, as if in calm,</p>
<p class="p1">unimpassioned thought, then he said—</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Major Clifton, my sister is now your wife, and you have, doubtless, the</p>
<p class="p1">perfect right to control her actions—neither do I accuse you of undue</p>
<p class="p1">severity in this affair, for, under like circumstances, I should,</p>
<p class="p1">perhaps, be tempted to act in the same way. I cannot account for this</p>
<p class="p1">letter. For the present, it must remain unexplained. Nor can I exculpate</p>
<p class="p1">myself any more than my sister from the odium of a suspicion, which God</p>
<p class="p1">knows I am willing to bear with her, since I cannot clear her of it. You</p>
<p class="p1">do not know how dear to an only brother’s heart is his only sister. Yes!</p>
<p class="p1">I _am_ willing to share the odium with her, hoping, _knowing_ that it</p>
<p class="p1">will pass away in time. And then, Major Clifton, you will feel more pain</p>
<p class="p1">at the recollection of the injustice you have done us, than I feel now</p>
<p class="p1">in suffering it. You will be more angry with yourself than I could be</p>
<p class="p1">with you. You will reproach yourself more bitterly than I could reproach</p>
<p class="p1">you, were I never so indignant. And I am not indignant at all. I could</p>
<p class="p1">not be so! All feelings are subdued to calmness in the sacred proximity</p>
<p class="p1">of the unburied dead in the next room. One thing only remains to be</p>
<p class="p1">said. It is this: I cannot continue to live upon this place, under the</p>
<p class="p1">cloud of the master’s ill opinion. My engagement as manager of this farm</p>
<p class="p1">terminates with this year, I shall be glad, if before the time expires,</p>
<p class="p1">you will provide yourself with another overseer.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“As you please, Mr. Kavanagh. Yet I should not have sent you away with</p>
<p class="p1">your young family.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“You are considerate, sir!” said Carl, bowing, then adding—“I presume</p>
<p class="p1">you have no further commands for me, Major Clifton?”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“None, Mr. Kavanagh.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Good-night, sir.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Good-night.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">The next day was the day of the funeral. Before the people began to</p>
<p class="p1">assemble, Catherine, impelled by an irresistible desire to gaze once</p>
<p class="p1">more upon the face of her beloved friend, found herself at the door of</p>
<p class="p1">the front parlor in which the corpse was laid out for burial. But here,</p>
<p class="p1">with her hand upon the lock, she hesitated, and finally stifling her</p>
<p class="p1">crying want turned away, saying within herself—“No, I will not intrude.</p>
<p class="p1">I will be guided by the spirit as well as by the letter of his commands.</p>
<p class="p1">He will not accept my love. To yield him perfect unquestioning obedience</p>
<p class="p1">is all the earthly comfort I have left.” And she began to retrace her</p>
<p class="p1">steps.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Major Clifton came out of the back room and met her face to face.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“What were you doing near that door, Catherine?”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“I wished to take a last look at her dear—” Here Kate burst into tears</p>
<p class="p1">and wept convulsively a few minutes—during which, Clifton watched her in</p>
<p class="p1">stern sorrow. Then controlling herself, she said, “I wished to look once</p>
<p class="p1">more, and for the last time, upon her beloved face. But when I reached</p>
<p class="p1">the door, and was about to enter, I remembered your commands and turned</p>
<p class="p1">back.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Clifton, who had never taken his eyes from her, groaned aloud. Then he</p>
<p class="p1">said, gravely and sadly—</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Catherine, if any feeling of penitential sorrow inspires your wish to</p>
<p class="p1">go there, go, in Heaven’s name! And may the sight of that dead face</p>
<p class="p1">bring you to repentance.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">She turned to thank him, and ask him what he wished her to repent—but</p>
<p class="p1">before she could find words, he had re-entered his study. Catherine</p>
<p class="p1">passed into the room of death, turned down the pall, and gazed upon the</p>
<p class="p1">face of the dead. It had changed very much—every furrow and every</p>
<p class="p1">wrinkle was softened out of it, the forehead was as smooth as the brow</p>
<p class="p1">of childhood, an ineffable, a divine repose spread like a dream of</p>
<p class="p1">Heaven over the features. Catherine’s tears were stayed, the convulsions</p>
<p class="p1">of her bosom were calmed, her soul was awed and exalted as she gazed</p>
<p class="p1">upon this countenance, so beautiful in death. But at last her full heart</p>
<p class="p1">revealed itself in a look of unutterable tenderness and devotion, and</p>
<p class="p1">she murmured, in low, slow, gentle tones—“You always loved and trusted</p>
<p class="p1">me, and for your dear sake, I will be a good wife to your son. Yes!</p>
<p class="p1">whatever he may be to me, for your dear sake, as well as for his own, I</p>
<p class="p1">will be a good wife to him. Hear my vow.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“I cannot think you dead. This is all I see—this beautiful, calm clay;</p>
<p class="p1">but I know your spirit hovers near. Hear my vow. Hear me promise, with</p>
<p class="p1">God’s grace, to dedicate all my faculties of brain, and heart, and hands</p>
<p class="p1">to his interest and happiness! to bear all things, to endure all things,</p>
<p class="p1">to hope all things, even to the end of life, come what may;” she stooped</p>
<p class="p1">and sealed her vow by a farewell kiss upon the brow and lips of that</p>
<p class="p1">beloved face, and reverently covered it, and—not to abuse her privilege</p>
<p class="p1">by too long a stay—slowly left the room. She never saw that face again.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Within an hour afterwards, the company began to assemble in great</p>
<p class="p1">crowds, for Mrs. Clifton was widely known and greatly respected and</p>
<p class="p1">beloved. The clergyman, who was to perform the burial service, arrived,</p>
<p class="p1">and the solemnity commenced. In the mean time Catherine sat in her</p>
<p class="p1">distant chamber, listening to the faint, inaudible sound of the</p>
<p class="p1">minister’s voice that reached her from afar, or else engaged in prayer,</p>
<p class="p1">but always calmed, strengthened and consoled. Many people at the funeral</p>
<p class="p1">wondered greatly why the young bride had not appeared with her husband;</p>
<p class="p1">but some one imagined it to be because she was too much overcome by</p>
<p class="p1">sorrow to be present, and told it as a fact, which was at once believed,</p>
<p class="p1">and circulated. And that—like many an other idle falsehood,</p>
<p class="p1">satisfactorily silenced conjecture. When the services were over, and the</p>
<p class="p1">funeral procession had left the house for the grave-yard—when Catherine</p>
<p class="p1">felt that her more than mother was now indeed gone, gone, gone—she cast</p>
<p class="p1">herself upon her bed in the last agony of sorrow.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Little household cares. What blessed though humble ministers to sorrow</p>
<p class="p1">they are—gently drawing away the mourner from the contemplation of her</p>
<p class="p1">grief, and compelling attention to themselves. So they give occupation,</p>
<p class="p1">and induce forgetfulness—aiding in their humble way the great</p>
<p class="p1">comforters, religion and time. An hour spent in bitter tears and sobs,</p>
<p class="p1">and then the little domestic duties came hovering about her like little</p>
<p class="p1">children, claiming her care. There was a large supper to be prepared,</p>
<p class="p1">and bed-chambers to be got ready for friends who had come from the</p>
<p class="p1">remoter parts of the county, and who would therefore remain until the</p>
<p class="p1">next morning. And so Catherine arose and refreshed herself with cold</p>
<p class="p1">water and a change of dress, and went below stairs to superintend the</p>
<p class="p1">operations of her cook and house-maids.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">When everything was in readiness, she went into the drawing-room, where</p>
<p class="p1">she received the returning visitors with a pensive, gentle dignity that</p>
<p class="p1">won all their hearts, proud conservators of rank as they were. And that</p>
<p class="p1">evening, young girl and new bride as she was, she presided at the head</p>
<p class="p1">of the long table, filled with the county aristocrats, with all the ease</p>
<p class="p1">and grace of a lady “to the manner born.” Preoccupied by one earnest</p>
<p class="p1">thought and purpose, she never once remembered herself as a new comer</p>
<p class="p1">into their ranks, or troubled herself with the question of what might be</p>
<p class="p1">their opinion of her. For the rest, her courtesy was graceful and</p>
<p class="p1">dignified, because it was natural, and not assumed—the effect of</p>
<p class="p1">benevolence and kindly social feeling, and not of pride, vanity, or</p>
<p class="p1">ostentation.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">The next morning, after breakfast, the guests departed. And many and</p>
<p class="p1">cordial were the invitations to their houses extended to Catherine by</p>
<p class="p1">all—even the haughtiest defenders of the sacredness of caste. Catherine</p>
<p class="p1">received all these civilities with a gracious nobleness, that sat</p>
<p class="p1">naturally and well upon her. And all this—the very evident esteem and</p>
<p class="p1">respect of her neighbors, and the admirable manner in which Catherine</p>
<p class="p1">received them, would have highly gratified the pride of Major Clifton,</p>
<p class="p1">could anything except her exculpation from suspicion have pleased him.</p>
<p class="p1">As it was, he witnessed it all with a moody brow, and sneering lip, and</p>
<p class="p1">murmured to himself—</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Better and better, ‘Maria Teresa.’ You should have seen more of the</p>
<p class="p1">world, before you threw your diplomatic talents away upon me, and my</p>
<p class="p1">country neighbors.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Well, at length they were all, to the very last guest, gone, and Major</p>
<p class="p1">Clifton and Catherine were left alone, left standing together in the</p>
<p class="p1">hall, whence they had seen the departures.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Catherine, hesitating between her fear of intruding upon his notice, and</p>
<p class="p1">her dislike to leave him abruptly and rudely, stood—no longer</p>
<p class="p1">self-possessed and noble—but with her eyes fixed upon the ground, and</p>
<p class="p1">with the color deepening in her cheek, in embarrassed silence, wishing</p>
<p class="p1">that he might say something to her, something to explain the nature of</p>
<p class="p1">that dark cloud that had arisen so strangely between them.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">He broke the silence by saying, coldly—</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Mrs. Clifton—” She started and colored, at hearing herself addressed by</p>
<p class="p1">her new name. “It is my intention to make White Cliffs our future home.</p>
<p class="p1">I desire that you be ready to accompany me thither to-morrow morning.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Catherine bowed her head in acquiescence. And with a cold nod, he placed</p>
<p class="p1">his hat upon his head, and walked forth.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Catherine went in, and occupied the remainder of the day in directing</p>
<p class="p1">the labor of her servants, who were all employed in setting the house in</p>
<p class="p1">order after the late, confusing events, in packing away goods, and</p>
<p class="p1">covering up furniture, and in preparing generally for the closing up of</p>
<p class="p1">the building.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">                             </span>CHAPTER XXXII.</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">                              </span>DEDICATION.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">                </span>Stand up, look below,</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">                </span>It is my life at thy feet I throw,</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">                </span>To step with into light and joy,</p>

<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">The next morning after breakfast, the family carriage was announced to</p>
<p class="p1">take them to White Cliffs. Catherine put on her bonnet and shawl, and</p>
<p class="p1">stood waiting, until Major Clifton, drawing on his gloves, came forward</p>
<p class="p1">and attended her to the carriage door. He handed her in, entered</p>
<p class="p1">himself, took the seat opposite to her, and bade the coachman drive on.</p>
<p class="p1">The whole distance between Hardbargain and White Cliffs was passed over</p>
<p class="p1">in perfect silence by the parties. Major Clifton preserving a stern</p>
<p class="p1">gravity of demeanor, and Catherine scarcely daring to lift her eyes,</p>
<p class="p1">lest she should encounter that severe but sorrowful gaze that almost</p>
<p class="p1">broke her heart. She longed to inquire—</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Oh, Major Clifton! What is this that has arisen between us? Give the</p>
<p class="p1">misery a name! Tell me?” But the shyness and fear she had always felt in</p>
<p class="p1">his presence, and doubly felt when he was reserved or displeased, and</p>
<p class="p1">above all, the bashfulness of new bridehood, forced her into silence.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">At last the ride was over, and the carriage stopped before the main</p>
<p class="p1">entrance of the mansion-house.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">The plantation laborers, in their holyday clothes, marshalled by the</p>
<p class="p1">overseer, were assembled upon the lawn, and the house servants in their</p>
<p class="p1">“Sunday’s best,” with the housekeeper at their head, waited on the</p>
<p class="p1">piazza “to pay their duty.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">When the carriage had drawn up, Major Clifton alighted and assisted his</p>
<p class="p1">bride to get out. He led her up the marble stairs to the front door. The</p>
<p class="p1">housekeeper with a curtsey, stepped forward to attend her. But with the</p>
<p class="p1">courteous kindness that Major Clifton seldom omitted, he waved her</p>
<p class="p1">aside, merely saying—</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Mrs. Mercer, send all these women about their duties, and tell Turnbull</p>
<p class="p1">to disperse the men. I do not wish to be disturbed. There is my</p>
<p class="p1">pocket-book—give them what they want—only let me be quiet.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“And give them my love and good wishes,” murmured Catherine, shyly, but</p>
<p class="p1">not wishing to dismiss them so coldly, for her desolate heart had been</p>
<p class="p1">comforted by the looks of sincere respect and affection with which they</p>
<p class="p1">had seemed to receive and accept her as their new mistress.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Major Clifton merely threw up his chin with an assenting nod, muttering—</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“The popularity-seeking instinct of the diplomatist.” He then conducted</p>
<p class="p1">her into the drawing-room, led her up its whole length, and seated her</p>
<p class="p1">upon a sofa with ironical ceremony, saying—</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Mrs. Clifton, you are welcome to White Cliffs.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Startled by his tone, she looked up, lifting those long, drooping</p>
<p class="p1">lashes, until her soft, dark eyes at last met his cold, rebuking gaze.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Then his whole aspect changed, and from having been sarcastic and</p>
<p class="p1">scornful, became grave and severe. Standing before her, he folded his</p>
<p class="p1">arms, drew himself up, and keeping his eyes fixed steadily upon her</p>
<p class="p1">face, said—</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“And now, lady, listen to me. The aim and object of your life is</p>
<p class="p1">accomplished—consummated. You have at length attained the position to</p>
<p class="p1">which you have long aspired, for which you have long and deeply and</p>
<p class="p1">successfully played. You are numbered among the ladies of the county</p>
<p class="p1">aristocracy. You bear the haughtiest name of all. You are Mrs. Clifton,</p>
<p class="p1">of Clifton.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">All this time her eyes, wide open, dilated, fascinated by surprise and</p>
<p class="p1">grief, met his stern gaze in sorrowful wonder, He continued—</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Yes, madam, you wear my name such as it is. You rule my house such as</p>
<p class="p1">_it_ is! But as for its poor master, lady, he is your most humble</p>
<p class="p1">servant, but no lover!”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Her eyes fell beneath his sarcastic look, and she was tempted to wish</p>
<p class="p1">herself dead.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">He continued—</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“I leave here in a few days, for the purpose of raising a company to</p>
<p class="p1">serve in the coming war with Great Britain. You will remain here at</p>
<p class="p1">White Cliffs to take charge of affairs during my absence. If you really</p>
<p class="p1">hoped to flaunt in the city this winter, I am sorry for your</p>
<p class="p1">disappointment. But there are duties as well as dignities attending the</p>
<p class="p1">position of the mistress of Clifton, and these must not be neglected. I</p>
<p class="p1">shall exact their performance. The overseer and the farm laborers, as</p>
<p class="p1">well as the housekeeper and her assistants, have orders to obey you in</p>
<p class="p1">everything. Good-morning, madam.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">And so abruptly he turned upon his heel and left her. One moment she sat</p>
<p class="p1">there amazed, confused, with her hands pressed upon her temples; and in</p>
<p class="p1">another, losing all feeling for herself—feeling only for him, she sprung</p>
<p class="p1">to his side, and caught his hand, exclaiming—</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Stay! For the love of Heaven, stay! one moment—only one moment, while</p>
<p class="p1">you tell me. Oh! _after all_, have I made _you_ unhappy?”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Unhappy! You have been and you are the bane of my life!”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“_How?_ Merciful Heaven, _how?_ when I only wish to consecrate mine to</p>
<p class="p1">you!”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Do you dare to ask me?”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Well!—tell me—tell me! _how_ can I remedy my fault—whatever it is? What</p>
<p class="p1">can I do to comfort you?”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“_Nothing_ but refrain from troubling me with your company or</p>
<p class="p1">conversation, when it is not absolutely necessary. Again—good-morning.”</p>
<p class="p1">And so he freed himself from her clasp, and left the room.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">She tottered backwards and fell into a chair, her head dropped upon her</p>
<p class="p1">hands and she gasped—</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“All-merciful Father, do not forsake me now, for I am desolate—I am</p>
<p class="p1">desolate.” And she sat despairing, fallen, the very image of utter</p>
<p class="p1">self-abandonment. She sat there until aroused by the voice of the</p>
<p class="p1">housekeeper, who entered the room, came up to her side, and spoke to her</p>
<p class="p1">twice before she heard—then—“What did you say?” she asked.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“I have come to receive your orders for the day, Mrs. Clifton.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“I——Please to manage, to-day, without my advice, I—I am not well—and</p>
<p class="p1">very, very weary.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“You look so, indeed, madam. There is a fire kindled in your chamber,</p>
<p class="p1">will you go up there and lie down, and let me bring you a cup of tea?”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“I——No, I thank you—I am much obliged to you. But—only leave me here to</p>
<p class="p1">rest.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">The housekeeper went and closed the shutters: stirred the fire, set a</p>
<p class="p1">screen between it and Catherine’s seat, and quietly withdrew.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Oh! this will never do!” said Catherine, trying to rouse herself from</p>
<p class="p1">her stupor of despair. “This will never do. To-day I have made a bad</p>
<p class="p1">beginning; but to-morrow I must rise and be as active and efficient as</p>
<p class="p1">if I were happy.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">She met Major Clifton again at dinner. The meal passed almost in</p>
<p class="p1">silence, and immediately after it was over, he took his hat and left the</p>
<p class="p1">house. She did not see him again until tea-time, after which, he went</p>
<p class="p1">and spent the evening in his study. Catherine felt the need of calm</p>
<p class="p1">thought, to understand her position and duties; and of prayer, to gain</p>
<p class="p1">strength and patience to perform them. She spent several hours in</p>
<p class="p1">reading the Scriptures, in meditation, and in prayer, and then,</p>
<p class="p1">comforted, retired to bed. She arose early the next morning,</p>
<p class="p1">strengthened and consoled, with a very clear perception of her</p>
<p class="p1">circumstances and responsibilities.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“My path through this intricate trouble is made very plain. I must</p>
<p class="p1">discharge every domestic duty and every social obligation, just as</p>
<p class="p1">faithfully, if not as cheerfully, as though I were a happy wife,” she</p>
<p class="p1">said. And she went down stairs, and gave her orders for the day.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">When Major Clifton came down into the breakfast-room he found a quiet</p>
<p class="p1">cheerful scene—a sunny window, a bright fire, a well spread</p>
<p class="p1">breakfast-table, and Catherine herself, in her simple morning-dress,</p>
<p class="p1">looking calm and placid. There was an expression of curiously blended</p>
<p class="p1">anger and admiration and amusement on his face, as he flapped his</p>
<p class="p1">dressing-gown around him, and dropped himself into the easy-chair by the</p>
<p class="p1">fire, giving her “Good-morning,” and hoping that she was well.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“As usual,” replied Catherine, handing him the paper that had just come</p>
<p class="p1">from the village, and ringing for breakfast.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">When the meal was over, he reseated himself in the arm-chair, reading</p>
<p class="p1">the newspaper, while Catherine still sat at the board, pouring out bowls</p>
<p class="p1">of coffee, and filling plates with toast or muffins, to send to the old</p>
<p class="p1">or sick among the negroes—these being always supplied with their meals</p>
<p class="p1">from the mistress’s table. Major Clifton glanced over the top of his</p>
<p class="p1">paper at her, sometimes in irony, sometimes in sorrow, always in doubt.</p>
<p class="p1">And she—unpleasant as his manner was, felt glad to have him near her. I</p>
<p class="p1">really believe that she had rather he sat there and made faces at her,</p>
<p class="p1">than not sat there at all. And she felt lonesome and dreary when at last</p>
<p class="p1">he left the room, put on his riding-coat and left the house. As</p>
<p class="p1">yesterday passed, so passed to-day—she meeting him only at meals. And so</p>
<p class="p1">a week passed on. It is not easy to be very heroic for a day, or two, or</p>
<p class="p1">three days; but when one day follows another, each with the same</p>
<p class="p1">continuous, extraordinary demand for fortitude, it is strange, indeed,</p>
<p class="p1">if heart and flesh do not fail under the task. Nothing but Divine</p>
<p class="p1">Providence can give the requisite strength of endurance. In the presence</p>
<p class="p1">of her husband, Catherine was calm and cheerful; but often in her</p>
<p class="p1">private hours the sense of desolate bereavement would come over her, and</p>
<p class="p1">gusts of tears and sobs would follow. These, like the summer gusts of</p>
<p class="p1">blessed nature, would always refresh her, and she would be enabled again</p>
<p class="p1">to take the comforting promises of the Bible to her heart, in her</p>
<p class="p1">favorite text—“And we know that all things work together for good, to</p>
<p class="p1">them that love God,” and to ask God’s blessing again upon her resolution</p>
<p class="p1">“to perform every domestic and every social duty as faithfully, if not</p>
<p class="p1">as cheerfully, as though she were a happy wife.” And yet it was very</p>
<p class="p1">hard to do this. It was very dreary to feel shut out from her husband’s</p>
<p class="p1">heart; to meet him every day with the same stern, sorrowful brow, or in</p>
<p class="p1">variation of that, with the same ironical smile. It was difficult to go</p>
<p class="p1">on with a repulsed and aching heart doing mere mechanical duty. She</p>
<p class="p1">could not have done so but that two powerful principles sustained her—an</p>
<p class="p1">invincible love for her husband, and an unwavering faith in God.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">One morning, about two weeks after their arrival at home, Major Clifton</p>
<p class="p1">sat alone, reading, in his study, when the door opened, and Catherine</p>
<p class="p1">entered. It was the first time that she had intruded there, and he</p>
<p class="p1">looked up, threw aside his book, arose, and pushed back his chair with a</p>
<p class="p1">look of annoyance.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Excuse me for interrupting you, but may I speak to you for a few</p>
<p class="p1">minutes?”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Speak on, madam, but oblige me by being brief. Pardon me—take a seat,”</p>
<p class="p1">he said, handing her a chair, and resuming his own.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Catherine sat down, felt very much like another fit of sobs and tears,</p>
<p class="p1">but restrained herself, and said, quietly—</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Major Clifton, whatever this is between us—”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“I must remind you that this is a prohibited subject of discussion,</p>
<p class="p1">madam,” he said, interrupting her.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“I will not talk of it again—how can I, indeed, when I do not know what</p>
<p class="p1">it is?”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">He made a gesture of angry disbelief, and begged her to come at once to</p>
<p class="p1">the object of her visit.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Well, then, I wished only at first to say, that whatever be the cause</p>
<p class="p1">of this cruel misunderstanding between us, it will pass away. You look</p>
<p class="p1">at me in surprise and doubt—but it _will_, Major Clifton—it _will_—it</p>
<p class="p1">_must_—there is no truth and reality in it, and it _must_ be temporary.</p>
<p class="p1">I have thought it all over, very sadly, but very calmly and clearly, and</p>
<p class="p1">I know that it _must_ be transient. My faith bridges over this</p>
<p class="p1">impracticable present in our lives, and I see the future, when you will</p>
<p class="p1">understand me. I never did anything to offend you in my life. And God,</p>
<p class="p1">to whom I have committed our cause, knows my innocence, and in His good</p>
<p class="p1">time He will make it plain. It must be so. The promise of the</p>
<p class="p1">All-Merciful, the Almighty Father, is pledged to the Right!”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">He turned away from her, with a stamp of fierce displeasure. He turned</p>
<p class="p1">away from her savagely, because he felt that, had he looked and listened</p>
<p class="p1">a moment longer, he should have abjured all his evil thoughts, and</p>
<p class="p1">snatched her to his bosom—she was so patient, so hopeful, so beautiful</p>
<p class="p1">with truth and love, that he could scarcely resist the impulse to fold</p>
<p class="p1">her to his heart—false as he deemed her to be. As it was, he suppressed</p>
<p class="p1">the true instinct—obeyed the false suspicion, and turning again sharply</p>
<p class="p1">upon her, demanded to know, once for all, to what this new piece of</p>
<p class="p1">hypocrisy tended.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“I mean this, Major Clifton—that as our estrangement must needs be</p>
<p class="p1">transient—do not, under its influence, let us do, or omit to do,</p>
<p class="p1">anything that may hereafter affect, unhappily, our social relations with</p>
<p class="p1">others.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“As——_how_, Mrs. Clifton?”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“_Thus._ The county families have all called upon us. It is high time</p>
<p class="p1">that we return their visits, if we mean to keep up the connection.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Oh! Ay! Excellently well thought of, Maria Teresa!” he sneered.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">With a passing look of distress, she said—</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“I only fear that our pleasant intercourse with the neighbors may not be</p>
<p class="p1">so easily resumed, if they have reason to suppose that we treat them</p>
<p class="p1">with indifference and neglect.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Admirably calculated, madam! A contingency has presented itself to your</p>
<p class="p1">diplomatic wisdom, that never would have occurred to my simpler mind.</p>
<p class="p1">So, you wish to confirm your position, and extend your connection here</p>
<p class="p1">in the county! Well! the aristocrats of R——, have certainly taken you up</p>
<p class="p1">with a zeal and determination that is surprising. But when they have</p>
<p class="p1">once made up their haughty minds to patronize a new comer, it is</p>
<p class="p1">wonderful to what length they will go. But you may thank your own fine</p>
<p class="p1">diplomatic talents for that!”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Diplomatic talents! What diplomatic talents? So many people have</p>
<p class="p1">‘thrust’ that questionable ‘greatness’ upon me, that it mortifies me.</p>
<p class="p1">No—I know the only value and currency I have among the county people, is</p>
<p class="p1">the value you have given me—the stamps of your name and rank. And I—I do</p>
<p class="p1">not wish to disparage it. I wish to appear worthy of it—that is all.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“And you really believe what you say?”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Truly, I do.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Again she looked so lovely, in her truth and humility, that he was</p>
<p class="p1">almost tempted to relent. And again the impulse only made him more</p>
<p class="p1">unjust.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“In a word, madam, what do you wish me to do, for I begin to weary of</p>
<p class="p1">this discussion. Nor is it well to subject myself to the influence of</p>
<p class="p1">your fascinations, for I candidly admit to you that I am sensible of</p>
<p class="p1">them, as others have been.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“I only wished to propose to you to take a day, and drive around the</p>
<p class="p1">neighborhood with me, to return the calls that have been made upon us.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Very well, madam, I am at your commands whenever you please to call</p>
<p class="p1">upon me for that service. When do you propose to go?”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“At your earliest convenience.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Will to-morrow do?”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“If you please.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“To-morrow then let it be. And now, Mrs. Clifton, have you any further</p>
<p class="p1">commands for me?”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Thank you—no,” she answered, very sadly, and turned to leave the</p>
<p class="p1">room—hesitated, came back, and resting her hand upon the study-table for</p>
<p class="p1">support, because she was trembling, said, “Forgive me—and let me speak</p>
<p class="p1">to you one more word, will you?”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“What is it?”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“It is so sorrowful to be misunderstood. Please, do not mistake me in</p>
<p class="p1">this matter. For myself, I do not care to follow up my acquaintance with</p>
<p class="p1">these county people. I have lived all my life without extensive social</p>
<p class="p1">intercourse. I have lived all my life in strict domestic retirement. I</p>
<p class="p1">am so used to it that it is natural and agreeable to me. Indeed, I</p>
<p class="p1">prefer it—but—”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Well?”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">She was suddenly silent. She wished to say, “But with _you_ it is</p>
<p class="p1">otherwise. Living in the county, _you_ need, or will hereafter need an</p>
<p class="p1">extensive neighborhood connection. And for _your_ sake, I would not</p>
<p class="p1">alienate these people by neglect.” But she could not say it. Her old</p>
<p class="p1">shyness, and a delicate fear of seeming to wish to place him under an</p>
<p class="p1">obligation, kept her mute.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Well, Mrs. Clifton? If such seclusion is so agreeable to you, why do</p>
<p class="p1">you wish to change it?”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“I owe the ladies some acknowledgment of their civility to us.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Have you anything farther to say to me?”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“No,” said Catherine, and with an involuntary gesture of pain and</p>
<p class="p1">distress, she turned and left the room, with all her generous thoughts</p>
<p class="p1">unspoken. When the door had closed behind her, Archer Clifton started</p>
<p class="p1">up, struck his clenched hands to his forehead, and pacing up and down</p>
<p class="p1">the floor, distractedly exclaimed—</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“I love her! I love her! It is no use, I _do_ love her! Every day more</p>
<p class="p1">deeply and desperately I love her! In her presence all her unworthiness</p>
<p class="p1">is forgotten or disbelieved! Yes! yes! her deep hypocrisy, her black</p>
<p class="p1">ingratitude, my mother’s wrongs, all, all are lost to memory! Just now I</p>
<p class="p1">could have snatched her to my bosom and wept over her falsehood, rather</p>
<p class="p1">than have cast her from me! Yes, more! I could have implored her</p>
<p class="p1">forgiveness for ever believing in that guilt which is but too well</p>
<p class="p1">proved! I love her! She is the pulse of my heart! the soul of my life!</p>
<p class="p1">She embodies all the meaning of existence to me! Heart and</p>
<p class="p1">brain—yes!—body, soul and spirit starve, perish for a full</p>
<p class="p1">reconciliation and a perfect union with her! She is lovely, she is</p>
<p class="p1">beautiful to me! She always was! Yet, oh! Apple of Sodom, that she is!</p>
<p class="p1">shall I take such falsehood and corruption to my heart. I must leave the</p>
<p class="p1">house! must leave the neighborhood! for here I wilt and wither! And she!</p>
<p class="p1">how _can_ she bear it? for I think, with all her falseness, she loves me</p>
<p class="p1">very much. How _can_ she bear life so? How can she rise each morning and</p>
<p class="p1">go through all the occupations of the day so regularly, quietly,</p>
<p class="p1">cheerfully, day after day?—omitting no duty, domestic or social, small</p>
<p class="p1">or great, from the stitching my ripped gloves, to the keeping up of the</p>
<p class="p1">county connection, in sooth! While _I_, I daily wilt, wither, in this</p>
<p class="p1">moral mildew—idle, despairing, forgetting all my obligations—forgetting</p>
<p class="p1">that my country needs my arm! This cannot last! This must not be! I must</p>
<p class="p1">get away from here! I must raise a volunteer company, and offer myself</p>
<p class="p1">to the government, and in the tumult of the campaign find forgetfulness</p>
<p class="p1">or a grave!”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Unable to compose himself again that morning, he rang the bell, ordered</p>
<p class="p1">his horse, seized his hat, went out, mounted, and rode away.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">The next morning Catherine arose early, and among her orders for the day</p>
<p class="p1">directed that the carriage should be at the door by ten o’clock. At the</p>
<p class="p1">appointed hour she attired herself with care and taste, and went down</p>
<p class="p1">into the front hall, where she found Major Clifton in readiness to</p>
<p class="p1">attend her. They entered the carriage and set out, and in the course of</p>
<p class="p1">a drive of five or six hours’ duration, made the circuit of the</p>
<p class="p1">neighborhood, calling upon several families. And everywhere Catherine</p>
<p class="p1">was received with distinguished respect. They reached home again about</p>
<p class="p1">the middle of the afternoon.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">The next few days passed on in the usual dreary routine—except that</p>
<p class="p1">Catherine knew Major Clifton was out riding every day and all day, and</p>
<p class="p1">that he was in his study writing half the night. She did not know what</p>
<p class="p1">this portended until one morning he said to her—</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Mrs. Clifton, you will oblige me by having my wardrobe prepared and</p>
<p class="p1">packed at your earliest convenience. I have orders to join the ——</p>
<p class="p1">regiment within a week.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Catherine turned very pale and reeled as if she would have fallen, but</p>
<p class="p1">grasped the chair and steadied herself, till strength returned.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“All shall be ready for you,” she replied.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">And he, with a cold bow of acknowledgment, went his way.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>

<p class="p1">Catherine remained seated in the chair into which she had sunk, with her</p>
<p class="p1">face buried in her open palms. Her favorite maid Henny, from the</p>
<p class="p1">Hardbargain farm-house, was in attendance. Henny had cleared away the</p>
<p class="p1">breakfast service, with the exception of the silver plate, which was</p>
<p class="p1">collected upon a salver; and she stood by her mistress’s chair waiting,</p>
<p class="p1">in respectful sympathy; at last she said—</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Miss Kate, honey, if you lend me the keys o’ the plate closet, I can</p>
<p class="p1">put away the things safe, without your troublin’ o’ yourself.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Catherine lifted her head languidly, and pushing away her drooping hair,</p>
<p class="p1">exclaimed, quite unconsciously, and as if the words burst of themselves</p>
<p class="p1">from her overburdened bosom—</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Oh! Henny, if you knew how little heart I have to do anything!”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“I _does_ know it, mist’ess, deary; but you mus’ jes take a ’flection on</p>
<p class="p1">to it, honey, an’ ’sider how it ain’t on’y marster, but mos’ in general</p>
<p class="p1">all the gemmum in the neighborhood, as is gwine far the wars.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Regretting that she had permitted a complaint to escape her lips, yet</p>
<p class="p1">satisfied that her servant did not understand or suspect the true cause</p>
<p class="p1">of her sorrow, Catherine arose, and said—</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Take up the salver and follow me, Henny. Idle grief is very fruitless.</p>
<p class="p1">If we cannot keep our friends with us, it is better to prepare for their</p>
<p class="p1">comfortable living while absent, than to sit down in useless sorrow.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“An’ that’s the Lord’s trufe, Miss Kate,” said Henny lifting the laden</p>
<p class="p1">salver on her head, and settling it steadily, “that’s Marster blessed</p>
<p class="p1">trufe! ’Sides which, I has a heap to do myself, to get brother Jack’s</p>
<p class="p1">duds ready, to go long o’ Marse Archy.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Is your brother going with Major Clifton, Henny?”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“’Deed he is, honey—gwine to ride body-servant long o’ marster, to wait</p>
<p class="p1">on him in camp; likewise in field o’ battle, to hold his t’other horse,</p>
<p class="p1">in case his whichest one should be shot unnerneaf of him—Oh, Lord</p>
<p class="p1">Marster Jesus! what a thing that is to think of! Likewise in soldier’s</p>
<p class="p1">newniform, on the bay horse Billy, which brother Jack would sell his</p>
<p class="p1">mortal soul any time, for the sake o’ dressing fine, an’ ridin’ a</p>
<p class="p1">horseback—cussed, infunnelly fool!—I axes your pardon, Miss Kate; don’t</p>
<p class="p1">look so ’noyed, honey; I won’t use bad words again—’deed, ’fore my</p>
<p class="p1">blessed, Hebbenly Marster won’t I, honey; but it is so aggravoking, when</p>
<p class="p1">I comes to think o’ what a slave I’ve made o’ myself to brother Jack,</p>
<p class="p1">ever since mother died, and the ’turn he makes me for it, wantin’ to go</p>
<p class="p1">gallivauntin’ off to the wars in soldier’s clothes, an’ a long tailed</p>
<p class="p1">horse! Here has I been ’jecting some o’ the most illegible colored men</p>
<p class="p1">in the neighborhood, an’ bein’ of an old maid, sake o’ takin’ care o’</p>
<p class="p1">him, ’cause he’s delicy in his health, an’ he to be wantin’ to go leave</p>
<p class="p1">me! An’ he, with a ’sumption in his breas’, to want to go; ’sposing of</p>
<p class="p1">hisself gettin’ his feet wet sogerin’! An’ he ’blige to wear a tar</p>
<p class="p1">plaster on his ches’, to be campin’ out an’ layin’ on the naked yeth!</p>
<p class="p1">An’ knows he can’t congest nothin’ but rabbits an’ partridges, an’ wants</p>
<p class="p1">to go where he’ll have to live offen roas’ tators, like Gin’al Marion</p>
<p class="p1">an’ his men, in the Resolutionary War! It mos’—mos’—mos’—breaks my</p>
<p class="p1">heart!”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">And with that Henny set down the salver and began to cry, while her</p>
<p class="p1">mistress opened the plate closet.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Put them in, Henny, and I will see what can be done for you</p>
<p class="p1">afterwards,” said Catherine.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Henny obeyed, and then said, as they left the room—</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“If you could ’suade Marse Archy to leave poor Jack, poor sickly fellow,</p>
<p class="p1">at home, an’ take some o’ the other young niggers. Der ain’t one o’ them</p>
<p class="p1">but ’ould be ’joyed to go. Der’s Dandy now, ’ould be willin’ to go to</p>
<p class="p1">his everlastin’ ruination, ’sake o’ ridin’ body-sarvant long o’</p>
<p class="p1">marster—”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“I will speak to Major Clifton, Henny. You know him to be kind and</p>
<p class="p1">considerate. And I am sure, he is not aware of Jack’s pulmonary</p>
<p class="p1">affection.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Yes he is, Miss Kate, honey! ’Deed he knows all about Jack’s ’fection</p>
<p class="p1">for him! High, honey! ain’t Jack been own man to Marse Archy ever since</p>
<p class="p1">they was boys together? An’ didn’t Jack wait on him when he wur at</p>
<p class="p1">college, and ole Mist pay extra for him? ’Deed she did, honey! ’Fore my</p>
<p class="p1">blessed Hebbenly Lord, did she! An’ he knows all ’bout Jack’s ’fection</p>
<p class="p1">for him, and he knows Jack ’ould follow him to the ind o’ the world, an’</p>
<p class="p1">jump off arter him! Lord love your heart, Miss Kate, ther ain’t no dog</p>
<p class="p1">marster’s got, loves him more faithful ’an brother Jack does.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Kate sighed very deeply, with a preoccupied air, but answered—</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“I will speak to Major Clifton in your behalf, Henny—now go and ask Mrs.</p>
<p class="p1">Mercer to come to me in my own chamber.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">And Catherine passed on to her own apartment, and Henny went her errand.</p>
<p class="p1">Very soon the housekeeper entered the chamber, and found Catherine</p>
<p class="p1">busily engaged among linen, stockings, cravats, and other “belongings.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“I want your assistance, Mrs. Mercer, in preparing Major Clifton’s</p>
<p class="p1">wardrobe this week.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“My dear child, I am so sorry! But I have been waiting for an hour to</p>
<p class="p1">speak to you. The truth is, I have just got a letter from my son-in-law,</p>
<p class="p1">who writes that my daughter is very, extremely low, with the bilious</p>
<p class="p1">pleurisy, and wants me to come right over to L—— immediately, without</p>
<p class="p1">loss of time, and I thought I would ask you for a leave of absence, till</p>
<p class="p1">she got better.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“And, certainly, I could not refuse it, Mrs. Mercer. I am sorry your</p>
<p class="p1">daughter is ill.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“And, my dear child, I was going to ask you if you could let me have one</p>
<p class="p1">of the mules this morning, and I would send it back to-morrow?”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“The weather is too cold, and the journey too arduous for a woman of</p>
<p class="p1">your age to perform it in that manner. Tell Dandy to put the horses to</p>
<p class="p1">the carriage for you.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“The carriage, dear honey, I shouldn’t think of such a thing. As many</p>
<p class="p1">years as I have been living in the family, I never used the carriage</p>
<p class="p1">once. The mule will do very well, if you will let me order him?”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Mrs. Mercer, why not? I shall not want it to-day. To-morrow Dandy can</p>
<p class="p1">bring it home.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“God bless you, child! you are so good hearted! It is a sin too to leave</p>
<p class="p1">you, so thronged as you are with work.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“No, I can get—get through,” replied Kate, with the same troubled,</p>
<p class="p1">preoccupied air that had marked her manner the whole morning. Mrs.</p>
<p class="p1">Mercer soon after took leave and departed.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">An hour after this, Catherine heard Major Clifton enter the hall door</p>
<p class="p1">and come up stairs. To her surprise, he paused before her chamber door</p>
<p class="p1">and rapped. When she opened it, he said—</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Will you favor me with your company in my study for a few minutes, Mrs.</p>
<p class="p1">Clifton?”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Catherine immediately laid down her work and followed him.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">When they reached the study, he set her a chair near the writing-table,</p>
<p class="p1">and dropping into another, drew a portfolio before him, opened it, and</p>
<p class="p1">turning out a number of papers, said—</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Mrs. Clifton, I told you, some weeks since, that at my departure, and</p>
<p class="p1">during my indefinite absence, I should be obliged to leave this estate</p>
<p class="p1">under your charge?”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Yes,” answered Catherine attentively.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“I am well aware that it is undoubtedly an onerous burden and</p>
<p class="p1">responsibility for one so young, but, when you feel it so, remember that</p>
<p class="p1">you, yourself, courted the position, and must be content to take the</p>
<p class="p1">toils with the honors, real or imaginary.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Passing over his bitter jibe, Catherine said—</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“You need not doubt in leaving all to my care that all will go well. I</p>
<p class="p1">am not twenty yet, it is true, but I have had much work and much</p>
<p class="p1">experience for my age, so that every year I have lived since ten years</p>
<p class="p1">old has counted double. You need suffer no anxiety in trusting me.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">He looked at her countenance, at once noble and meek in expression; he</p>
<p class="p1">remembered the life of toil, self-denial, and devotion she had lived; he</p>
<p class="p1">even recollected a certain text of Scripture which said, “By their</p>
<p class="p1">_fruits_ ye shall know them—do men gather _thorns_ of _fig trees_?” but</p>
<p class="p1">the demon of cherished suspicion whispered, “’Twas all done for a</p>
<p class="p1">purpose,” and he hardened his heart, and replied—</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Oh! madam, I have no doubt or hesitation in placing the plantation</p>
<p class="p1">under your care, and I shall have no anxiety in leaving it so for an</p>
<p class="p1">indefinite period; not only because I have much faith in your natural</p>
<p class="p1">talents and acquired experience, but, also, because I have more</p>
<p class="p1">confidence in your self-love. And knowing that _you_ know our interests</p>
<p class="p1">in the prosperity of this estate to be identical, I rest assured that</p>
<p class="p1">you will do for it your very best.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“He—in all other circumstances, and to all other people—so noble, so</p>
<p class="p1">liberal, so charitable—he never speaks to me but to upbraid me!” was the</p>
<p class="p1">thought that presented itself to Catherine’s mind, but with the loyalty</p>
<p class="p1">of her nature she repelled it, saying, within herself, “It is because he</p>
<p class="p1">has what he thinks condemning evidence of my unworthiness—would he but</p>
<p class="p1">charge me! would he but tell me what it is?”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Will you give me your attention, Mrs. Clifton?” he asked, breaking into</p>
<p class="p1">her sad reverie.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Catherine bowed gently.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">And he took down the “farm-book” from a shelf, opened it, and laying it</p>
<p class="p1">before her, entered upon a series of details and explanations on both</p>
<p class="p1">debt and credit sides of the accounts, with which it is not necessary to</p>
<p class="p1">trouble the reader. After two or three hours spent in looking over</p>
<p class="p1">bills, comparing them with receipts, calculating results, etc., he</p>
<p class="p1">closed the book, replaced the papers in the portfolio, clasped it, and</p>
<p class="p1">turning around to Catherine, said—</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“You understand, now?”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Yes, perfectly.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“As for these heavy notes that will fall due the first of January, you</p>
<p class="p1">must contrive an interview with the holders, and get them renewed upon</p>
<p class="p1">security—as I said before, remember.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“I shall not forget.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“No, or if you do, the holders of the notes will bring them to your</p>
<p class="p1">recollection in not the pleasantest manner. And now, Mrs. Clifton, I</p>
<p class="p1">wish you to keep a vigilant eye over Turnbull, and hold him to a strict</p>
<p class="p1">account. I _suspect_ the man. I never have been able to understand how,</p>
<p class="p1">with such a heavy force of negroes on this plantation, it has been</p>
<p class="p1">necessary to hire about a baker’s dozen of white laborers, all of them,</p>
<p class="p1">you understand, his own relations—brothers, sons, and nephews! I have</p>
<p class="p1">reason to mistrust the fellow, but no time to look after him. Hold him</p>
<p class="p1">to a strict account, Catherine.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Suppose, for the coming year, you should place my brother Carl here as</p>
<p class="p1">overseer? You have tested his skill and probity.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">This was a very unlucky proposition on Catherine’s part. He sat back in</p>
<p class="p1">his chair, and looking at her in steady scorn, said—</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Yes, madam, I _have_ ‘tested his skill and probity,’ and know so well</p>
<p class="p1">the degree of the former, and the quality of the latter, that I have</p>
<p class="p1">already forbid him to set foot on my premises or speak to my wife. Do</p>
<p class="p1">you dare to think that I am your dupe, or his? And now, hear me: In all</p>
<p class="p1">the directions that I have given you, I have simply desired or requested</p>
<p class="p1">you to do this or that, but in this matter of your perfidious brother</p>
<p class="p1">Carl, I _command_ you to hold no intercourse with him whatever.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“You shall be obeyed,” said Catherine, “you shall be obeyed,” and she</p>
<p class="p1">thought—“Your simplest wish, expressed to that effect, would have had</p>
<p class="p1">all the power of this arbitrary command,”—but she did not say it. She</p>
<p class="p1">was never free of speech, least of all to him. And now he arose, as if</p>
<p class="p1">to conclude the interview. And she recollected her promise to Henny, to</p>
<p class="p1">intercede for Jack, and always more courageous in the cause of any, even</p>
<p class="p1">the humblest, than in her own, she gently detained him, by saying—“I</p>
<p class="p1">wished to speak to you about the servant you intend to take with you.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Jack?”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Yes. You were not home last winter, and you do not know that he was</p>
<p class="p1">sick with a cough the whole winter, and that he is consumptive.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“I have sometimes thought so, however! Well?”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Indeed I feel that it is properly no business of mine, and I beg you</p>
<p class="p1">will excuse my interference. I would not willingly, I am sure—”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“To the point, if you please, Mrs. Clifton.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Well, I am afraid that if you take him, and expose him to the</p>
<p class="p1">unavoidable hardships of campaign life, he will fall sick on your hands,</p>
<p class="p1">and instead of being a help, be a hindrance. Therefore it is much more</p>
<p class="p1">for your sake than for the boy’s own, that I should be pleased if you</p>
<p class="p1">would leave him here and take another.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“There is much reason in what you have advanced, Mrs. Clifton. Yet,</p>
<p class="p1">among all the negroes on the place, there is none but Jack who seems fit</p>
<p class="p1">for the duty, the others are all too young or too old, or too hopelessly</p>
<p class="p1">stupid and lumbering.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“There is Dandy, a handsome, likely mulatto, strong and intelligent,</p>
<p class="p1">dressy and enterprising, the very man for an officer’s servant; he would</p>
<p class="p1">be very proud and glad to attend you.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Oh! ay! I know that he is anxious to go; but he is your carriage-driver</p>
<p class="p1">and waiter, Catherine, and I cannot think of depriving you of him.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“There are other careful drivers on the place. Please take him with</p>
<p class="p1">you.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Yes—but those other careful drivers are awkward, ill-looking,</p>
<p class="p1">farm-laborers, accustomed to driving and hallooing after ox-teams.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Have I been so long used to a carriage, as to be choice in my coachman,</p>
<p class="p1">then? Please do not think of that.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“And then he is your waiter and messenger.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Oh, believe me, I do not need him. Pray take him with you. He is so</p>
<p class="p1">active, intelligent and faithful, that he will be of inestimable value</p>
<p class="p1">to you in the campaign.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“It is precisely because he is so active, intelligent and faithful, that</p>
<p class="p1">I am unwilling to deprive you of his services, Catherine—I beg your</p>
<p class="p1">pardon—_Mrs. Clifton_,” he corrected himself, suddenly changing his</p>
<p class="p1">involuntarily relenting manner into the old sarcasm and scorn.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Oh, call me Catherine, please call me Catherine,” she said, losing half</p>
<p class="p1">her reserve.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Why? Do you dislike the other name?”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“No—I like it. I am proud of it—not because it is a high, haughty name,</p>
<p class="p1">but because it is _yours_. When other people call me ‘Mrs. Clifton,’ my</p>
<p class="p1">heart springs with pride and joy, but when you call me so—”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Ah, now, do not let us grow sentimental, madam! I prefer to call you</p>
<p class="p1">Mrs. Clifton because I think that the fancied dignity for which you have</p>
<p class="p1">toiled and plotted so long, and patiently, and successfully, should be</p>
<p class="p1">constantly brought to your mind.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">With a deprecating, imploring gesture, and a brow crimsoned until the</p>
<p class="p1">purple veins started out, Catherine, pierced by this keen sarcasm, sank</p>
<p class="p1">into a chair.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Unpityingly, he added—</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“And now, Mrs. Clifton, I really must entreat you to excuse me. I expect</p>
<p class="p1">Turnbull here, every instant, to have a talk about the stock.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Catherine arose, trembling, and left the room; one agonized complaint</p>
<p class="p1">bursting from her tortured bosom—</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Oh, I would to Heaven this were over—some way!”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">He looked after her, with a countenance convulsed with sorrow, groaning—</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“_And so would I!_ And so would I to God that this were over—_somehow_!</p>
<p class="p1">Oh!” he thought, rising again, and pacing the floor—“there is nothing in</p>
<p class="p1">life so humiliating to an honorable-minded man, as to love and live with</p>
<p class="p1">a perfidious woman—to be daily tempted by his own heart and her</p>
<p class="p1">blandishment, to become her dupe and his own scorn! To be hourly on the</p>
<p class="p1">brink of clasping just so much proved treachery as her form conceals, to</p>
<p class="p1">a half loving, half loathing bosom! Serpents! Yes, I dreamed of a</p>
<p class="p1">serpent, last night:—methought I was in the forests of Brazil, and the</p>
<p class="p1">fatal cobra-di-capello had coiled itself around my neck, and raised its</p>
<p class="p1">horrid head to mine, and I went to snatch the deadly reptile away, and</p>
<p class="p1">found it to be only Catherine’s gentle arms and noble face. Devils!</p>
<p class="p1">Never did a demon hide itself under a more deceptive form and face!—with</p>
<p class="p1">that saint-like blending of nobility and meekness in her countenance.</p>
<p class="p1">Every time she talks with me, she brings me to the very brink of</p>
<p class="p1">abjuring my sincere convictions. I must get away from this place, or my</p>
<p class="p1">mind will become unsettled, deranged. I must hasten my departure, and in</p>
<p class="p1">the meantime, she shall not talk with me again. She shall not cross the</p>
<p class="p1">threshold of this room again, or if she does, she shall meet with such a</p>
<p class="p1">reception that she shall speedily retire.” And so, torn with passion, he</p>
<p class="p1">walked and raved, while Catherine sought her room, and threw herself</p>
<p class="p1">upon the bed, giving way to a burst of tears and sobs, and crying, in</p>
<p class="p1">wild rebellion—</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“God! Oh, God! Infinite in power and love—do You see me? Do You see me,</p>
<p class="p1">and withhold Your help? Oh, God! God!” But soon upon her fevered spirit</p>
<p class="p1">fell the word of the Lord like dew—“All things work together for good,</p>
<p class="p1">to them that love the Lord.” And full of penitence for her impatience,</p>
<p class="p1">she knelt, and humbled herself “under the mighty hand of God.” And then,</p>
<p class="p1">comforted with love and hope, strengthened with faith and courage, she</p>
<p class="p1">arose, and went about her work.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Meeting Henny soon after, she told her to be consoled, for that she</p>
<p class="p1">thought Jack would be let off.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">In the afternoon she received a pencilled note from Major Clifton,</p>
<p class="p1">announcing that he should leave home three days sooner than he had</p>
<p class="p1">anticipated, namely, on the third day from that date. Leaning against</p>
<p class="p1">the projecting chimney piece, she held the note, stupidly gazing at it.</p>
<p class="p1">But two days were left before he should depart then—she thought—and he</p>
<p class="p1">was going, really going upon a long and perilous military service, and</p>
<p class="p1">parting with her in deep, unmitigated anger, under the seemingly</p>
<p class="p1">ineffaceable impression of her utter unworthiness—believing her to be</p>
<p class="p1">guilty of—what? ay! what? for up to this moment she had not the</p>
<p class="p1">slightest idea of his reason for condemning her. And now she blamed</p>
<p class="p1">herself for cowardice, in having hesitated to entreat him to inform her</p>
<p class="p1">of what fault or crime she was suspected, and to give her the</p>
<p class="p1">opportunity of exculpating herself. And she reproached herself for that</p>
<p class="p1">failing of the heart, and falling of the eyes, and faltering of the</p>
<p class="p1">voice, that made her so powerless, and placed her at such a disadvantage</p>
<p class="p1">in his presence. “Oh, yes, indeed,” she said, “I know my manner is</p>
<p class="p1">enough to convict me; I do not wonder at nor blame him for thinking ill</p>
<p class="p1">of me, so long as my eyes sink beneath his look. But how can I help it.</p>
<p class="p1">It must be so while he frowns or sneers. One encouraging word or glance</p>
<p class="p1">from him, and I could look up and speak.” And next she remembered how</p>
<p class="p1">much he must suffer in continuing to think her unworthy, and in</p>
<p class="p1">departing under that impression—and at this thought, all that was most</p>
<p class="p1">generous and benevolent in her nature arose to inspire her with courage,</p>
<p class="p1">and she resolved to go to him, and, though heart and frame should</p>
<p class="p1">tremble to meet that dread look of stern sorrow or piercing scorn—to</p>
<p class="p1">persevere in imploring him to tell her with what crime she stood</p>
<p class="p1">charged.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">But though she had determined upon this act, it was extremely difficult</p>
<p class="p1">to perform it. All the afternoon and evening he came and went in such</p>
<p class="p1">hurry, and seemed so entrenched behind his own private thoughts and</p>
<p class="p1">purposes that she feared to break in upon his reserve. Once indeed for</p>
<p class="p1">the purpose of speaking to him upon the subject, she entered his study,</p>
<p class="p1">and stood by the table; but he turned around, drew himself up, sat back</p>
<p class="p1">in his chair, and looked upon her with such sarcastic arrogance, that,</p>
<p class="p1">abashed and confounded, without opening her lips she turned and left the</p>
<p class="p1">room.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">And so the afternoon and evening passed, and the next day, the last of</p>
<p class="p1">his stay, arrived. All day Catherine sought an opportunity of speaking</p>
<p class="p1">with him alone. In vain! He was resolved to afford her none. He</p>
<p class="p1">sedulously avoided her. As a last resort she wrote a note, requesting an</p>
<p class="p1">interview, and sent it to him. She received an answer stating that his</p>
<p class="p1">time for the day was all pre-engaged. And so this last day also passed.</p>
<p class="p1">That night she completed her part in the preparations for his departure,</p>
<p class="p1">and retired late to a sleepless bed. She heard him come in very late,</p>
<p class="p1">and enter his room, which joined her own.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">At early dawn she arose and looked at the time-piece on her chamber</p>
<p class="p1">mantle-shelf. It was but five o’clock. He was not to leave till ten.</p>
<p class="p1">There were five precious hours left yet. And oh! how inestimably</p>
<p class="p1">precious, if in them she could effect a reconciliation with her husband.</p>
<p class="p1">They were like the last hours of a dying one, with salvation staked upon</p>
<p class="p1">them. She felt that the crisis had come, that she must not falter now.</p>
<p class="p1">She knelt and prayed for strength and courage, as we only pray a few</p>
<p class="p1">times in life—with that impassioned earnestness of supplication that</p>
<p class="p1">ever brings an angel down “strengthening” us. Then, encouraged, she</p>
<p class="p1">arose, completed her simple toilet, and went down stairs to her morning</p>
<p class="p1">duties. The breakfast hour was seven. And oh, she watched the clock as</p>
<p class="p1">she, unjustly condemned to death, might watch in the last fleeting hours</p>
<p class="p1">preceding execution—hoping, still hoping for some saving revelation. A</p>
<p class="p1">little while after seven he came down stairs, entered the</p>
<p class="p1">breakfast-room, and bowing with his usual cold greeting of—</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Good-morning, madam,” sat down.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">She rang for the coffee, and then took her place at the head of the</p>
<p class="p1">table.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">He went through with the morning meal, with his customary, reflective</p>
<p class="p1">leisure. And Catherine watched the hand of the clock, as it traveled on</p>
<p class="p1">towards eight. She was sick with apprehension. She could not speak to</p>
<p class="p1">him there, for the servants were in attendance. At last he arose, left</p>
<p class="p1">the table, and went out to give some final directions concerning his</p>
<p class="p1">baggage, and the horses and servants he was to take with him. And then</p>
<p class="p1">he went up stairs and entered his study. It was just eight o’clock, and</p>
<p class="p1">she had two invaluable hours left yet. As if life and death hung upon</p>
<p class="p1">their issue, she resolved come what might, to use them in a final effort</p>
<p class="p1">for a reconciliation. Pale and trembling in every limb, she left the</p>
<p class="p1">table, and went up stairs, slowly, holding by the balustrades from</p>
<p class="p1">weakness. When she reached the study door she found it ajar, and through</p>
<p class="p1">it she saw him sitting at his writing-table—not busy, as she had feared</p>
<p class="p1">and expected to find him, but doing absolutely nothing—with his elbows</p>
<p class="p1">resting on the table, and his face buried in the palms of his hands—in</p>
<p class="p1">the attitude and expression of the deepest sorrow and despair. That one</p>
<p class="p1">glimpse of his suffering face, sufficed to drive every fear but that of</p>
<p class="p1">anxious affection from her heart—“It is because he thinks me unworthy. I</p>
<p class="p1">must not leave him to think so longer. Be strong, coward heart,” she</p>
<p class="p1">said, to herself, and then she went in and stood beside his chair,</p>
<p class="p1">resting her hand, for support, upon the table, trembling with nervous</p>
<p class="p1">weakness, and blushing with the bashfulness she could not but feel in</p>
<p class="p1">making this advance, and altogether, in his suspicious eyes, looking</p>
<p class="p1">very much like a conscious culprit. She stood, unable to utter one word,</p>
<p class="p1">until he lifted up his head, and seeing her, demanded coldly—</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“What is your pleasure, Mrs. Clifton?”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">She attempted to speak, but a mute sob was all that ensued.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">With a piercing sarcasm, he asked—</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Can I serve you in any manner this morning, madam?”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">With a gesture of deprecation and entreaty, she answered—</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Yes! yes! I wish to be put upon my trial! Archer!—Major Clifton! you</p>
<p class="p1">withdrew your favor from me so suddenly! You never told me why! Oh! tell</p>
<p class="p1">me, before you go, how I have been so wretched as to lose your</p>
<p class="p1">esteem—and put me upon my defence.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">He frowned, darkly, as with both pain and anger, and replied—</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“I have had occasion twice before to remind you, Mrs. Clifton, that this</p>
<p class="p1">is a prohibited subject of conversation between us.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">She clasped her hands, in the earnestness of supplication, exclaiming—</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Why? Oh! why? You were always just. You never judged your poorest</p>
<p class="p1">slave, unheard! Oh! what have I done, or omitted to do? Tell me! Make</p>
<p class="p1">the charge, and see how I can answer it! Archer!—I mean Major</p>
<p class="p1">Clifton—forgive it—but for all, it springs so naturally from heart to</p>
<p class="p1">lip, to call you Archer—because—because there is no feeling of</p>
<p class="p1">estrangement in my heart, nor can I make it there! Major Clifton,</p>
<p class="p1">then!—consider!—the greatest criminals have the right of a trial, with</p>
<p class="p1">the crime of which they are suspected, distinctly and openly charged</p>
<p class="p1">upon them—with the evidence on both sides taken, and their defence</p>
<p class="p1">heard, before they are condemned. I know that you would not be otherwise</p>
<p class="p1">than just. Will you condemn me untried, unjudged, unheard?”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“It is quite sufficient to me, madam,” he answered, haughtily, “that the</p>
<p class="p1">proofs of your turpitude are conclusive to my own mind.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“I know it,” she said, meekly, “I know it—yet, pause—what would you</p>
<p class="p1">think of the justice of a judge, who should say to one suspected of</p>
<p class="p1">crime—‘Your guilt is so clear, that it is useless to charge you with it,</p>
<p class="p1">or to hear the testimony, or to listen to what you might have to say in</p>
<p class="p1">your defence,’ and so proceed to condemn him? Such things were never,</p>
<p class="p1">surely, done, in the darkest ages, or under the most despotic rulers.</p>
<p class="p1">And is that guilt, of which I am suspected, of so heinous a character as</p>
<p class="p1">to preclude me from the privilege extended even to criminals—the</p>
<p class="p1">privilege of a trial?” She paused—but he continued to regard her with a</p>
<p class="p1">stern, set face, without replying. Drooping over the table, and leaning</p>
<p class="p1">heavily upon it, she spoke again, and her voice fell in low, but clear,</p>
<p class="p1">melodious tones, as she said—“God and man, and I, myself, have made you</p>
<p class="p1">my judge, and the arbiter of my destiny here. It is an awful power. You</p>
<p class="p1">have made me feel it to be such. It is an awful power, because it is a</p>
<p class="p1">subtile, invisible power—higher, and deeper, and broader than any law. I</p>
<p class="p1">have no appeal from it—none! Nor—please to understand me—do I wish for</p>
<p class="p1">any—for if all the world were to clear me, I should still be condemned,</p>
<p class="p1">if you condemned me. And oh! listen, and believe me—believe me, for it</p>
<p class="p1">is from my deep heart that I speak this truth—if you had the power and</p>
<p class="p1">the will to doom me to death—my instincts would teach me rather to</p>
<p class="p1">receive death at your hands, than to save my life by appealing from your</p>
<p class="p1">judgment to another tribunal. I am loyal. I am faithful! God knoweth</p>
<p class="p1">that I am. Let me prove it. Put me upon my defence. Do not—oh, do not</p>
<p class="p1">persist in condemning me, unheard.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Catherine,” he answered, in a softened voice—“you are not condemned; if</p>
<p class="p1">you were, you would not be standing here at my side.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“What do you mean? good Heaven!”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“THIS,” he replied with a sudden change of manner, as though angry with</p>
<p class="p1">himself for his transient relenting. “This! that oftentimes it happens</p>
<p class="p1">that the only mercy we can show the guilty, is _not_ to bring them to</p>
<p class="p1">trial! To openly recognize guilt, is to be obliged to punish it. If we</p>
<p class="p1">distinctly accuse, we are bound to prove, and if we prove, to condemn</p>
<p class="p1">and sentence.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“And is my case such a one?”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Your case is such a one.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Yet still I beg to be tried! For if _not_ to try them is often the only</p>
<p class="p1">way to save the guilty, to _try_ them is oftener the only way to clear</p>
<p class="p1">the innocent. Accuse me—hear my defence, and be yourself my judge. I ask</p>
<p class="p1">no other.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Of what avail were it to rehearse your acts of falsehood and treachery.</p>
<p class="p1">You know them this moment even better than I do.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Falsehood and treachery—just Heaven!”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Yes, madam, those were the words I used.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“You are mistaken in attributing such wickedness to me but tell me the</p>
<p class="p1">grounds of your suspicions; doubtless I can explain them, and clear</p>
<p class="p1">myself.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">He laughed a scornful, sardonic laugh, and replied, “Oh, doubtless a</p>
<p class="p1">woman of your diplomatic genius is fertile in explanations. Whether you</p>
<p class="p1">could by possibility clear yourself, is another question; for I</p>
<p class="p1">speak—not of suspicions but of positive knowledge.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">His strong conviction of her turpitude infected her with despair at</p>
<p class="p1">last. She said, very mournfully—</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“I know that it has sometimes happened that the innocent have been tried</p>
<p class="p1">and convicted—overwhelmed by a mass of circumstantial evidence—and that</p>
<p class="p1">may be my case; nevertheless, even they have had the poor satisfaction</p>
<p class="p1">of knowing for what they suffered. Tell me, I beseech you. I will still</p>
<p class="p1">hope that I can acquit myself. Not for my own sake, Archer, dear</p>
<p class="p1">Archer—but for yours: it must be so agonizing to be forced to think ill</p>
<p class="p1">of one we have loved as you once loved me. I suffer very much in the</p>
<p class="p1">loss of your esteem, but were it possible for our cases to be</p>
<p class="p1">reversed—were I forced to think evil of you, I do not know, indeed I do</p>
<p class="p1">not know how I could go on with daily life at all!”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“I think you had better cease discoursing and retire, your diplomatic</p>
<p class="p1">talent is not in high action this morning; you permit your words to</p>
<p class="p1">betray you.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“To betray me!”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Yes, madam; for if you felt yourself to be innocent, would you not</p>
<p class="p1">necessarily think very ill of me for treating you as a guilty woman?”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“No! no! I know that to have condemned me so promptly, so unequivocally,</p>
<p class="p1">you must have, what you think, proof positive against me. But produce</p>
<p class="p1">it! I am innocent; indeed I am, Archer. I believe in Heaven’s justice. I</p>
<p class="p1">believe that if I call on the Lord, He will sooner or later, in His own</p>
<p class="p1">good time, enable me to prove it.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“I _will_ produce the testimony,” he said, going to an escritoir,</p>
<p class="p1">opening it and taking from it a note in a gray envelope. Returning to</p>
<p class="p1">his seat, he laid it before her, asking “Is this your hand-writing?”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Catherine glanced at it—it was the envelope she had directed to Mrs.</p>
<p class="p1">Georgia Clifton, and she immediately answered—</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Yes, certainly it is.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Ah! it is; when was it written?”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“The last day of your dear mother’s life. Ah! now I remember, it was</p>
<p class="p1">from that day you took your favor from me.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Yes, madam,” he said, withdrawing the fatal note from the envelope, and</p>
<p class="p1">laying it before her, adding, “Do you acknowledge _this_ as your writing</p>
<p class="p1">also?”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Catherine looked at the note without heeding the words, and raising her</p>
<p class="p1">innocent eyes with wonder to his face, answered, without an instant’s</p>
<p class="p1">hesitation—</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Yes, assuredly, that is mine!”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Her perfect unconsciousness should have convinced him of her</p>
<p class="p1">innocence—would have done so perhaps, but that, prejudiced against her,</p>
<p class="p1">he took her manner to be super-refined art; and determined to force her</p>
<p class="p1">to the point, he said—</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Would you swear it?”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Catherine took up the letter and examined it.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Ay! read it, read it.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Catherine read the note, turned deadly pale, fell back in her chair, and</p>
<p class="p1">let the paper drop from her hands—overwhelmed by the enormous wickedness</p>
<p class="p1">of the forgery. Scarcely restraining a bitter curse, he picked up the</p>
<p class="p1">fatal note, pushed the door open with his foot, crossed the hall, and</p>
<p class="p1">entered his bed-chamber, banging the door after him.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">One stunned moment she sat thus, then started to her feet, bewildered,</p>
<p class="p1">distracted, and with a wild impulse, fled across the hall and into his</p>
<p class="p1">chamber, and sank at his feet speechless, mute, but catching his hand,</p>
<p class="p1">and clinging to it. When she struggled and recovered her voice, she</p>
<p class="p1">exclaimed, simply—</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“I did not write that letter, Archer. I did not write that letter.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">He twisted his hand rudely out of her grasp, and turned away, without</p>
<p class="p1">reply.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">She clasped her hands earnestly, exclaiming again—</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“I did not write that letter! It is impossible I ever should have</p>
<p class="p1">conceived, much less have written such a letter! I do not know who wrote</p>
<p class="p1">it. I never laid my eyes on it before!”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">An incredulous, insulting smile, was his reply.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Oh! what shall I say to convince you? _Indeed_, _indeed_ I did not do</p>
<p class="p1">it!”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Come, perjure yourself! Swear it.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">She was silent.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“I ask you to swear it.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">She was still silent.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Come, now—will you declare upon oath that you did not write that</p>
<p class="p1">letter?”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“God sees me! I did not!”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“That’s no oath! Here’s the New Testament, swear upon the Holy</p>
<p class="p1">Evangelists of Almighty God that you didn’t write it, and, perhaps, I</p>
<p class="p1">will believe you, for well I know that many unprincipled people have a</p>
<p class="p1">sort of fearful respect for an oath, which in them is not piety, but</p>
<p class="p1">superstition. I think you just such a one! Come, now, swear that you did</p>
<p class="p1">not write it!” He paused for an answer, but she looked at him in great</p>
<p class="p1">trouble. “Will you do it?”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Major Clifton, I cannot!”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Not swear that you did not write it?”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“No, sir.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Then that only confirms and seals the truth of what I knew before,</p>
<p class="p1">that, of course, you _did_ write it.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">She wrung her hands in deep distress, and said—</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“I cannot swear, Archer. I mean I _dare_ not swear, Archer, even to</p>
<p class="p1">prove my innocence, and get back your love.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“And why, pray?” he asked, with a mocking smile.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Oh, Archer! my Lord and yours has commanded us to ‘_Swear not at all_.’</p>
<p class="p1">I dare not break that command.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Tush, girl, you are clumsy. Do you presume to think I can be duped by</p>
<p class="p1">that affectation of super-righteousness?”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Oh, Heaven! Oh, Heaven! what shall I do?” said Catherine, in despair.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Swear, and I will believe you,” he answered, mockingly.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Oh! _why_ will not my simple word do? Oh! do you think I would tell a</p>
<p class="p1">falsehood even to save my life?”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Do I? Does not an astute diplomatist, like you, know that _I_ know a</p>
<p class="p1">woman who can be false, treacherous, hypocritical;—who, so young, can</p>
<p class="p1">plot so well, and succeed so entirely;—can also tell a falsehood to</p>
<p class="p1">conceal her baseness?” he answered, looking down upon her in</p>
<p class="p1">insufferable scorn.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Then her whole manner changed. She arose to her feet with a certain calm</p>
<p class="p1">and gentle dignity, and pushing back the veiling tresses from her noble</p>
<p class="p1">brow, answered nobly—</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Yes, it is true! If I could have conceived such treachery, and written</p>
<p class="p1">such a letter as that, I could also have lied to conceal it! There is</p>
<p class="p1">only one on earth that knows my innocence, the writer of that letter.</p>
<p class="p1">But one in Heaven knows it, and He will make it manifest. I believe in</p>
<p class="p1">miracles, because I believe in the infinite power and goodness of God,</p>
<p class="p1">and in the everlasting promises of the Bible.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Well done, Maria Teresa! really that is the best of all! Indeed, your</p>
<p class="p1">talents are quite lost upon such unworthy game as me and my poor</p>
<p class="p1">estate—good-bye!” And laughing bitterly, he left the room, and hurried</p>
<p class="p1">down stairs. A few minutes after she heard the clock strike ten—then she</p>
<p class="p1">arose and went to the window to look out. He stood upon the lawn, in</p>
<p class="p1">riding gear, near a group consisting of his servant Dandy, and three</p>
<p class="p1">saddle-horses. She saw him vault into his saddle, and ride away,</p>
<p class="p1">attended by Dandy, mounted on one horse and leading another. As he</p>
<p class="p1">passed the outer gate, one look of love, sorrow, and despair, he turned</p>
<p class="p1">towards her window, and then vanished into the forest road.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">She did not see that look—she could not have seen it at that distance;</p>
<p class="p1">she saw that he was gone, and turning from the window, she sank down</p>
<p class="p1">upon the carpet in the collapse of deepest sorrow.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Gone! He was gone! His presence that had made all suffering tolerable</p>
<p class="p1">was withdrawn, and the place was empty—life itself was empty.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">He was gone—gone—not lovingly, after a lingering, tender</p>
<p class="p1">leave-taking—that would have been sorrowful enough; but it would have</p>
<p class="p1">been cheered by the promise of frequent interchange of letters, and the</p>
<p class="p1">anticipation of re-union; how much more sorrowful this utter separation!</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Gone! gone! not in anger—that would have been bitter indeed; but it</p>
<p class="p1">would have been sweetened by hope that anger would subside, that</p>
<p class="p1">reflection would come, and reconciliation ensue; but how much bitterer</p>
<p class="p1">this hopeless disunion.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Gone in scorn! Gone in loathing! Gone to return no more but as a</p>
<p class="p1">stranger! Oh, insupportable grief! Oh, hopeless anguish! Oh, despair!</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">A few short weeks ago the heaven of her life had been so serene, so</p>
<p class="p1">divinely serene, and her soul had reflected back the beautiful “great</p>
<p class="p1">calm,” as a still lake the clear sky.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Now all was changed! Now all was clouds and storm and darkness! A</p>
<p class="p1">howling wilderness around! A howling tempest overhead! And her soul</p>
<p class="p1">answered back the tempestuous discord of life, as the storm-tossed</p>
<p class="p1">ocean, the storm-lowered sky! All was confusion, distraction, chaos!</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Wild impulses—suggestions of the fiend—darted meteor-like athwart her</p>
<p class="p1">mind:—to fly—to go away and leave a place, where she had been brought a</p>
<p class="p1">bride, full of love and hope and trust, and where every feeling of</p>
<p class="p1">womanly pride and delicacy had been ruthlessly, insultingly trampled in</p>
<p class="p1">the dust!</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">But simultaneously with this suggestion, arose the instinct of the wife,</p>
<p class="p1">and the inspiration of the Christian, teaching her that scorned and</p>
<p class="p1">outraged as she had been, her only post of duty as of _hope_, was her</p>
<p class="p1">husband’s home. Yes, amid all the gloom and terror, she caught this one</p>
<p class="p1">glimpse of Heaven. Amid all the clash and clang of passion and despair,</p>
<p class="p1">she heard this voice of God.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">                             </span>CHAPTER XXXIV.</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">                          </span>CATHERINE’S REGENCY.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">                </span>But a trouble weighed upon her,</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">                  </span>And perplexed her night and morn,</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">                </span>With the burden of a station</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">                  </span>Unto which she was not born.—TENNYSON</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Slowly, very slowly Catherine recovered from the shock of that bitter</p>
<p class="p1">parting. And then she felt so lonely—so desolate; no mother—no sister—no</p>
<p class="p1">bosom friend, to give her one comforting look of sympathy, or one</p>
<p class="p1">sustaining word of affection. And she mourned afresh the loss of that</p>
<p class="p1">dear, sympathising, maternal friend, always so ready in her loving</p>
<p class="p1">wisdom, always so ready in any trial or affliction to give counsel and</p>
<p class="p1">comfort. And, oh! Catherine needed these—for, like the black, scudding</p>
<p class="p1">fragments of clouds left by the tempest, dark, despairing thoughts</p>
<p class="p1">drifted through her mind. Yes, she had need, and profoundly felt that</p>
<p class="p1">need, of counsel and comfort in this bewildering sorrow; but of whom</p>
<p class="p1">could she seek it? Of none—of none must she seek it. The true wife’s</p>
<p class="p1">instinct taught her that. For even when the retrospective image of his</p>
<p class="p1">dead mother, her own beloved bosom friend, recurred in the shape of a</p>
<p class="p1">once possible mediator between herself and husband, her mind intuitively</p>
<p class="p1">recoiled from the idea, and she knew that were that dear mother now</p>
<p class="p1">living, not even of her could she make a confidant—that the religious</p>
<p class="p1">unity, the integral sanctity, the cherished exclusiveness of marriage</p>
<p class="p1">would be invaded and broken, and the sweet charm lost by the</p>
<p class="p1">introduction of a third party—beloved even as that dear, mutual</p>
<p class="p1">mother—into its sacred counsels. No, unhappy and bewildered as she was,</p>
<p class="p1">she felt that by all her hopes of a future happy union, this wretched</p>
<p class="p1">division must be kept to herself—upon herself solely recoil the burden</p>
<p class="p1">and the pain—she “must tread the wine press alone.” And even when she</p>
<p class="p1">prayed for Divine inspiration to guide her, the response came from the</p>
<p class="p1">depths of her spirit, “The Word of God is within you.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">And how empty the house seemed because one was away—how gloomy—how</p>
<p class="p1">funereal—even the light footstep of a chamber-maid in the distance</p>
<p class="p1">sounded hollowly,—sending a dreary echo through the many passages of the</p>
<p class="p1">great, empty house—empty, for that he was gone.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">It seemed not worth while to go on with daily life at all—to keep up the</p>
<p class="p1">fire on the household hearth, or to light the evening lamp, or to order</p>
<p class="p1">meals for herself alone.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">But if Catherine were for once tempted in her sorrow to forget her</p>
<p class="p1">duties,—her duties were not the least disposed to leave her long in</p>
<p class="p1">peace—no, not for an hour.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Catherine was roused from her fit of deep thought by the entrance of a</p>
<p class="p1">field woman, who, with the usual curtsey, and the customary greeting</p>
<p class="p1">of—“Sarvunt, ma’am,” stood before her.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Kate raised her heavy eyelids abstractedly.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Sarvunt, ma’am,” said the woman, again curtseying, “Aunt Field Mary is</p>
<p class="p1">well over it, ma’am. It’s a boy-chile, ma’am; a likely little boy-chile</p>
<p class="p1">as ever you see, ma’am. An’ Aunt Field Mary told me to tell you, ma’am,</p>
<p class="p1">how, thank the Lord, an’ she’s fotch through safe, an’ how she wouldn’t</p>
<p class="p1">let dem sturve you las’ night, caze you wur so tired, an’ caze it wur</p>
<p class="p1">the lassest night Marse Archer had to stay home. An’ Aunt Field Mary</p>
<p class="p1">say, would you please to come down der to her quarter an’ see her dis</p>
<p class="p1">mornin’, and how she wants some green tea, an’ loaf sugar,</p>
<p class="p1">an’—an’—_wine_, if you please, ma’am.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“What—what did you say?” asked Catherine, passing her hand over her</p>
<p class="p1">forehead, to dispel the concentration of sorrowful thought.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Aunt Field Mary, ma’am, it’s a boy-chile, ma’am, a likely little</p>
<p class="p1">boy-chile as ever you see, ma’am, an’ she’s fotch well through of it,</p>
<p class="p1">thank Marster, ma’am, an’ she say, how will you come an’ see her, an’</p>
<p class="p1">send her some liquor, an’ things. Likewise, Uncle Jubilee, its daddy,</p>
<p class="p1">ma’am, he say, can’t he have a holyday to-day, ma’am, an’ stay home</p>
<p class="p1">out’n de field, seein’ how it’s his firstest son an’ hier out’n seven</p>
<p class="p1">darters.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Passing her hand across her forehead slowly, Catherine dispersed the</p>
<p class="p1">last lingering fragments of her bitter reverie, and stood up to her</p>
<p class="p1">simple, practical, household duties. And then her action was clear and</p>
<p class="p1">decided. She took up her little basket of keys, bade the woman follow</p>
<p class="p1">her, and went down stairs and into the pantry, where she filled a hamper</p>
<p class="p1">with tea and sugar, crackers, jelly, and other little matters, and gave</p>
<p class="p1">it to her attendant, saying—</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Take these to Field Mary, and say that I will be down to see her</p>
<p class="p1">presently.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Yes, ma’am, sure ’nough. But ’bout de liquor, honey? likewise Uncle</p>
<p class="p1">Jubilee’s holyday, seein’ how it’s his firstest son an’ hier out’n seven</p>
<p class="p1">darters?”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Tell Mary that I cannot send her wine, it is not good for her now; but</p>
<p class="p1">tell her to mention any other want, and if it be a proper one, it shall</p>
<p class="p1">be supplied. Tell Jubilee to return to the field—his labor cannot</p>
<p class="p1">possibly be spared from it to-day. And stay—what is your name?”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Nelly, ma’am. ’Deed it is, honey. That’s my name, Nelly.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“I think I never saw you up at the house before, Nelly?”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“No, ma’am, likely not, chile, indeed. I lives quite distant off, down</p>
<p class="p1">der on Cedar Creek, unnerneaf of Bushy Hill der on de outskeerts o’ de</p>
<p class="p1">plantashum.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Well, Nelly, who is tending Field Mary?”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“_I_ is, ma’am. Hardbargain Henny, she long o’ her now. But _I_ tends</p>
<p class="p1">her. I tends all de wimmin hands when dey’s sick, ’deed I does, chile.</p>
<p class="p1">But poor creeturs, dey alluz wants der miste’ss, _alluz_. I never knew</p>
<p class="p1">dem to fail o’ fretting arter _her_, dey don’t seem to feel kinder safe</p>
<p class="p1">widout her, dough I alluz tells de poor ignoran’ creeturs, der mist’ess</p>
<p class="p1">can’t do nuffin ’tall—dere in de han’s o’ de Lord—not in de mist’ss’s.</p>
<p class="p1">An’ dar Fiel’Mary, ’ceitful thing, sendin’ you word how she didn’t want</p>
<p class="p1">you sturved, arter keepin’ on arter us all night to send for you; but I</p>
<p class="p1">telled her good I wan’t agoin’ to have the young madam wurritted long o’</p>
<p class="p1">her ‘fernal nonsense, bein’ as it was de lassest night Marster had to</p>
<p class="p1">stay at home.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Yes, there, go now,” said Catherine, waving her hand wearily.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Nyther wan’t it any sort o’ use, case I, myse’f, dough I should’n be de</p>
<p class="p1">fuss to bray affen it, am as knowin’ a ‘oman as if I wur book edified,</p>
<p class="p1">bein’ as I has had thirty years ’speriments, ten years practysin’ on ole</p>
<p class="p1">Marse Roger Gower plantashum, down in ole Si’ Mary’s, ’fore I came here,</p>
<p class="p1">nuss long o’ Miss Car’line Gower, wid her fuss baby, which was our Miss</p>
<p class="p1">Car’line Clif’n. An’ dat war twenty odd year ago, an’ I’se had twenty</p>
<p class="p1">years ’speriments here. Lord, mist’ess, ma’am, whenever you ’quires any</p>
<p class="p1">’vice and ’sistance, you ain’t no ’cassion to call in any dem derned,</p>
<p class="p1">infunnelly, roguing doctors as makes you worse sick, purpose o’ gettin’</p>
<p class="p1">more credit and money for makin’ you well.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“There—there—there—there, Nelly, return to your patient.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Yes, mist’ess, I’m gwine now, ma’am, only I wanted to tell you while I</p>
<p class="p1">trought of it, how when eber you ’quire of de aid an’ comfort, you no</p>
<p class="p1">call to send offen de plantashum, case—”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Nelly, there is one thing that I must say to you now, and which I wish</p>
<p class="p1">you to remember. It is that when I give a direction I intend it to be</p>
<p class="p1">followed.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">The old woman looked mortified, and took up the hamper, settled it upon</p>
<p class="p1">her head, and went out. It pained Catherine’s gentle heart to speak so</p>
<p class="p1">peremptorily. But this was one among the abuses she felt it to be her</p>
<p class="p1">imperative duty to reform, the habits of idleness and listlessness, and</p>
<p class="p1">the propensity to stand and gossip among the domestics. Trifling as this</p>
<p class="p1">little incident was, it served to arouse Catherine and place her on her</p>
<p class="p1">feet, and she did not utterly sink again.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">The evening fire was kindled on the household hearth, and the evening</p>
<p class="p1">lamp lighted, though there was but one lonely woman to feel their</p>
<p class="p1">cheering influence.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">The next day was the Sabbath, and Catherine as usual attended church.</p>
<p class="p1">She felt deeply the need of religious consolation. Her spirit hungered,</p>
<p class="p1">thirsted, failed and fainted for the feeding, refreshing, strengthening</p>
<p class="p1">ministrations of the gospel. The old, sad, unanswered problem of</p>
<p class="p1">unmerited suffering perplexed her. She felt herself sinking into that</p>
<p class="p1">sad and nearly hopeless state of mind, induced by great and singular</p>
<p class="p1">trials to be borne perforce alone and in secret—when, wanting human</p>
<p class="p1">sympathy and failing of divine comfort, the soul loses sight of the</p>
<p class="p1">Merciful Father in the Omnipotent Creator, or in other words, of</p>
<p class="p1">especial Providence in general Providence, and falls sadly, despairingly</p>
<p class="p1">back upon its helpless self, and says that the Supreme Ruler of the</p>
<p class="p1">Universe, the Governor of countless millions of suns and systems, never</p>
<p class="p1">stoops to care for a poor, lost atom like itself. She needed to hear the</p>
<p class="p1">gospel message of love and hope again. But when she entered her pew, and</p>
<p class="p1">raised her eyes to the pulpit, she was disappointed in missing from his</p>
<p class="p1">place the mild and venerable face and form of the parish clergyman,</p>
<p class="p1">whose teachings every Sabbath morning sent her home with renewed love,</p>
<p class="p1">and sustained her through the week, and she was pained to see in his</p>
<p class="p1">stead a young man, a mere youth in seeming, some student newly ordained,</p>
<p class="p1">she supposed, and she sank back in her seat, saddened with the thought</p>
<p class="p1">that she would not get the greatly needed spiritual help from him; for</p>
<p class="p1">what could a student in his youth know of life’s dread trials? of the</p>
<p class="p1">heart’s mournful experiences, or the spirit’s deep needs? She felt sure</p>
<p class="p1">he could not help her, and she sank back, resigning herself with a deep</p>
<p class="p1">sigh. The opening hymn was given out—</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">                 </span>God moves in a mysterious way</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">                   </span>His wonders to perform,</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">                 </span>He plants His footsteps on the sea.</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">                   </span>And rides upon the storm.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">                 </span>Ye fearful souls, fresh courage take,</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">                   </span>The cloud ye so much dread</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">                 </span>Is big with mercy, and shall break</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">                   </span>In blessings on your head.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">The first words of this hymn fell upon Catherine’s surprised ear,</p>
<p class="p1">filling her soul with awe—for it seemed a direct answer to her thought.</p>
<p class="p1">And all that hymn, every stanza, every line, was filled with meaning for</p>
<p class="p1">her, and powerful in its effect upon her mind, in its peculiar state of</p>
<p class="p1">experience. She listened in penitent, grateful, reverent silence,</p>
<p class="p1">folding her hands meekly, and saying within her heart—</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Father, forgive my doubts and fears! I will believe it! Yes, I will</p>
<p class="p1">believe that even this heavy cloud is laden with mercy, and will shower</p>
<p class="p1">blessings! I will believe that even this bitter trial—this bitter,</p>
<p class="p1">bitter separation and disunion, is in some way necessary to our moral</p>
<p class="p1">growth and future welfare, and that I shall see it! I _do_ believe it,</p>
<p class="p1">for I have had blessed answers before to doubts. ‘And we know that all</p>
<p class="p1">things work together for good to them that love the Lord.’ I do believe</p>
<p class="p1">it.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">                      </span>God is His own interpreter,</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">                        </span>And He will make it plain,</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">were the solemn last words of the Divine Song that awed her into</p>
<p class="p1">stillness. This hymn was sung, Catherine’s beautiful voice joining the</p>
<p class="p1">choir. And when it was ended, followed the prayer, so singularly</p>
<p class="p1">coincident, that every word gave voice to the deep silent cry in her own</p>
<p class="p1">suffering heart.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">And then the young minister arose to give out the text: Matthew x. 29.</p>
<p class="p1">“Are not two sparrows sold for a farthing? And one of them shall not</p>
<p class="p1">fall on the ground without your Father.” And here followed the sermon.</p>
<p class="p1">The manner of the young preacher was modest, natural, calm and sweet, as</p>
<p class="p1">befitted the gentle words of the text, and the consoling subject of the</p>
<p class="p1">sermon—FAITH IN PROVIDENCE—the child-like faith that comes through the</p>
<p class="p1">heart, and not through the head. Catherine had thought he could not help</p>
<p class="p1">her. Never had she been more in error in her life. That pale young</p>
<p class="p1">preacher had a divine message for her—for _her_; an answer to her</p>
<p class="p1">unsolvable problem; a message, providentially, the most direct, pointed,</p>
<p class="p1">strong, startling that ever fell from lips touched with fire,</p>
<p class="p1">revivifying the soul of the receiver; a message that satisfied every</p>
<p class="p1">doubt, and calmed every fear, and replied to every question as</p>
<p class="p1">perfectly, as satisfyingly, as if Heaven had spoken; a message that</p>
<p class="p1">aroused faith, revived hope, rekindled love, till all the soul glowed</p>
<p class="p1">with divine fire. She was wrapped, entranced, carried away by the</p>
<p class="p1">eloquence, power and pathos of this divinely-inspired discourse. She</p>
<p class="p1">never saw the young preacher before or after, but he had dropped a</p>
<p class="p1">celestial treasure deep into where she kept it safe—a talisman through</p>
<p class="p1">all the trials of life.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">She left the church loving, hopeful, strong in faith, strong to act and</p>
<p class="p1">endure, patient to wait. So elevated and inspired was her soul, that it</p>
<p class="p1">illumined her whole countenance. And when the county ladies crowded</p>
<p class="p1">around her at the church door to condole with her on the departure of</p>
<p class="p1">Major Clifton, and to press hospitalities upon her, and to urge her not</p>
<p class="p1">to mope in widowhood at home, their benevolent purposes were forgotten</p>
<p class="p1">in their surprise, and the first words were—</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Why, how brightly you look this morning, Mrs. Clifton!”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Catherine promised many visits, and extended many invitations, and</p>
<p class="p1">finally was glad to escape and enter her carriage, to dwell in lonely,</p>
<p class="p1">loving reverence upon the words she had heard. And she reached home. And</p>
<p class="p1">the Word departed not from her, neither that day, nor the next, nor</p>
<p class="p1">through life. And with the perfect faith in God, perfect trust in her</p>
<p class="p1">future came. And again she whispered to herself the charming thoughts—</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“I will wait patiently—I will work faithfully. The post of duty, as of</p>
<p class="p1">hope, is my husband’s house and home. He trusts me, at least, even now,</p>
<p class="p1">with the charge of this great plantation. Construe it as he may, it is a</p>
<p class="p1">mark of great confidence. I will be true to the trust.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">And then, indeed, as she whispered these words to her heart, hope, sweet</p>
<p class="p1">hope, inspired her more and more, and strengthened her more and more,</p>
<p class="p1">and she felt that he still loved her—she felt it by that sure instinct</p>
<p class="p1">that teaches a woman when she is beloved, though no word, look, or</p>
<p class="p1">gesture reveals it to her. And she acted upon this feeling, although</p>
<p class="p1">almost unconscious of its existence as a _motive_. And she knew that she</p>
<p class="p1">would be useful to him, substantially useful to him where she was—for</p>
<p class="p1">with her it was not enough to be devoted, soul and body, to his</p>
<p class="p1">interests,—no, “wishing well” _must_ have a “body in it,” in order “to</p>
<p class="p1">be felt.” She communed with her heart, asking—</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“What, besides the service of God, do I really live for in this world?</p>
<p class="p1">For his happiness. Yes, my profound heart, that is it! For his good, his</p>
<p class="p1">interests, his welfare. I have not been an obstacle to his happiness. I</p>
<p class="p1">have not been a stumbling block in the way of his marrying another. No!</p>
<p class="p1">for I feel that he loves me as he never loved another; and I love him as</p>
<p class="p1">he was never loved by another; and has any other the instinct, the</p>
<p class="p1">inspiration, the strength and patience to bear with him, that God has</p>
<p class="p1">placed in my heart? I will believe and trust in the Lord and His</p>
<p class="p1">inspirations. And heart, and brain, and hands,—all that I am, and all</p>
<p class="p1">that I have, will I devote to his service. And until he restores me,</p>
<p class="p1">that alone shall make my occupation and my happiness.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">The next morning being Monday, she arose with the intention of taking</p>
<p class="p1">seriously in hand the business of the estate. This was now the first of</p>
<p class="p1">December, and there was a great deal to be done before the close of the</p>
<p class="p1">year, in financial, as well as in domestic and agricultural matters. The</p>
<p class="p1">overseer and the hired farm-laborers had all been paid in advance, up to</p>
<p class="p1">the first of January. And Major Clifton had left Catherine twelve</p>
<p class="p1">hundred dollars in cash, for her own current expenses. All this money</p>
<p class="p1">she had at once determined to devote to another purpose—namely—to</p>
<p class="p1">lifting some of those notes which would fall due on the first of the</p>
<p class="p1">year. She determined, also, in order to help to clear off the incubus of</p>
<p class="p1">debt for the coming year, to try to find a tenant for Hardbargain, and</p>
<p class="p1">to devote the rent to the taking up of the remaining notes. She went</p>
<p class="p1">into a patient and thorough examination of the overseer’s accounts, and</p>
<p class="p1">discovered, with much pain, that he had embezzled the funds trusted to</p>
<p class="p1">him for the payment of the hired hands; and a stricter review of his</p>
<p class="p1">conduct, resulted in the detection of other malpractices, that decided</p>
<p class="p1">Catherine to give him warning. A very little observation convinced her,</p>
<p class="p1">also, that the “baker’s dozen of hired laborers, all his own kin folks,”</p>
<p class="p1">were an unnecessary and expensive set of idle parasites, of whom she</p>
<p class="p1">determined to rid the plantation at the end of the year. She finally</p>
<p class="p1">concluded still further to lower the scale of expenditures, by parting</p>
<p class="p1">with her housekeeper. She reconciled herself to this last step, when she</p>
<p class="p1">heard of a place in the neighborhood to which Mrs. Mercer might go. Yet</p>
<p class="p1">Catherine did not wish to make these important changes without again</p>
<p class="p1">consulting Major Clifton. And, perhaps—let the whole truth be</p>
<p class="p1">told—perhaps poor Kate was desirous to hear from him, and glad of a fair</p>
<p class="p1">business excuse to write. And she wrote the following note. She had some</p>
<p class="p1">trouble with it. It was the first (except the lines at the funeral,) she</p>
<p class="p1">had ever written him, and, under all the circumstances, she hesitated</p>
<p class="p1">how to begin, or how to end it. She disliked to address him as a mere</p>
<p class="p1">acquaintance, and she shrunk from any warmer manner of greeting.</p>
<p class="p1">Finally, she wrote, as she would have written to a friend—thus—</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">                                      </span>“WHITE CLIFFS, December 8th, 1812.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“DEAR MAJOR CLIFTON:—</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“After a very careful investigation of the affairs of the plantation,</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>and much patient thought concerning them, I have concluded—if I have</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>your approbation and authority for doing so—that the establishment can</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>be cut down so as to reduce the annual expenditure to about one-half</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>its present amount—also, that the Hardbargain farm can be let for a</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>sum, double the annual amount of what we can save at White Cliffs.</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>And, finally, that the aggregate of these moneys, saved and acquired,</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>will be sufficient, in two years, to pay off the accumulated debts</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>oppressing the estate. (Here followed a more detailed account of her</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>plans.) Please write, and let me know if I have your authority for</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>proceeding.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">                                            </span>Yours, faithfully,</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">                                                            </span>“CATHERINE.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">In due time, Catherine received the answer. She seized it with an eager</p>
<p class="p1">hand. She opened it with trembling fingers. She most unreasonably</p>
<p class="p1">hoped—poor girl—for some kind, relenting word—some token of approbation</p>
<p class="p1">or affection. Truly, she believed in miracles. This was the precious</p>
<p class="p1">epistle—</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">                                          </span>“HAMPTON, December 16th, 1812.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“MADAM:—</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Your favor of the 8th instant lies before me. I beg leave to</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>reiterate now what I said at parting—viz: that I have not the</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>slightest hesitation in leaving the plantation to your own exclusive</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>charge and direction—having no doubt that self-interest will guide</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>your talent into the surest means of recruiting the resources of the</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>estate. Let Hardbargain, by all means, if it pleases you to do it,</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>remembering that I have nothing to do with that cunningly acquired</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>little piece of property of yours. Regarding the dismissal of the</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>housekeeper, the overseer, and the hired farm-laborers, whom you</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>consider as supernumeraries, send them off, by all means, if you think</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>it proper to do so. I, myself, perhaps, should have hesitated, ere I</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>sent them adrift upon the world. But money-saving is, I presume, a</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>plebeian instinct.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Finally, pray govern in your own way, without ever again thinking it</p>

<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">                             </span>CHAPTER XXXV.</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">                         </span>CATHERINE’S PROGRESS.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">               </span>And she grew a noble lady,</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">                 </span>And her people loved her much.—TENNYSON.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Catherine’s arrangements for the year were all completed by the first of</p>
<p class="p1">January; and with less inconvenience to others, and consequently with</p>
<p class="p1">less pain to herself, than she had dared to anticipate.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">She heard that Turnbull, the cashiered overseer, had purchased a piece</p>
<p class="p1">of land in the valley—(doubtless with the embezzled funds, but of that</p>
<p class="p1">she did not think)—built upon it a log cabin, and set up as a farmer</p>
<p class="p1">upon his own footing; and that he had taken his tribe of sons and</p>
<p class="p1">nephews to assist him. She was very much pleased to know that they were</p>
<p class="p1">out of the way of swindling others as they had swindled Clifton, and</p>
<p class="p1">also that they were equally removed from want and suffering.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Mrs. Mercer, by her warm recommendation, had found a very eligible</p>
<p class="p1">situation as housekeeper to an elderly, single gentleman—a planter in</p>
<p class="p1">the neighborhood—and her benevolence was set at rest in regard to the</p>
<p class="p1">old woman.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Lastly, she had let Hardbargain to excellent tenants—a young New</p>
<p class="p1">Englander and his wife—who took it ready furnished and stocked as it</p>
<p class="p1">was; and designed to work the land and keep a school.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">The negroes had their usual carnival at Christmas, lasting till after</p>
<p class="p1">New Year—during which, all that had been engaged in the last twelve</p>
<p class="p1">months were married, and wedding parties were given and dances got up,</p>
<p class="p1">etc., etc.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">But on the second of January, Catherine caused them all to be assembled</p>
<p class="p1">in her presence, and told them that she should, on the next Monday and</p>
<p class="p1">thereafter, set them to work in earnest; that their overseer was</p>
<p class="p1">gone—(“Thank Marster Lord for that,” exclaimed several)—but that she</p>
<p class="p1">herself would be their overseer for the ensuing year. (“You’ll be fair,</p>
<p class="p1">young mistress! We ain’t afeard o’ you,” said the same.) She waved her</p>
<p class="p1">hand for silence and attention, and then informed them farther—that</p>
<p class="p1">though they should find her hereafter as heretofore, just and moderate</p>
<p class="p1">and merciful; ready to give ear to their complaints, and settle their</p>
<p class="p1">difficulties, and reward their zeal—yet that she should certainly</p>
<p class="p1">require a more steady and systematic application to their duties than</p>
<p class="p1">they had ever before given. She said, in conclusion, that their health,</p>
<p class="p1">comfort, improvement and happiness, should be her care; but that even in</p>
<p class="p1">this also, she should need their co-operation—(“You shall hab it,</p>
<p class="p1">mist’ess, ’deed you shall, honey;” from some of the older negroes.)</p>
<p class="p1">Finally she dismissed them, telling them that she wished to see them all</p>
<p class="p1">together again on Sunday evening at early candle-light, in the</p>
<p class="p1">spinning-room, where she desired that they should assemble quietly.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">On Saturday evening when the women were done spinning, Catherine</p>
<p class="p1">directed that all the wheels should be taken to one corner of the room,</p>
<p class="p1">and crowded together, and that the settees and benches from the piazza</p>
<p class="p1">and lawns, should be brought in and arranged around the walls; and</p>
<p class="p1">finally that a little reading stand and chair should be brought for her</p>
<p class="p1">own use. These preparations occupied but ten minutes, and the room was</p>
<p class="p1">fitted up for family worship.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">On Sunday evening, at the appointed hour, Catherine met her assembled</p>
<p class="p1">laborers and servants there. When they were all seated and perfectly</p>
<p class="p1">still and attentive, she said to them—“I desired your presence here this</p>
<p class="p1">Sabbath evening, that I might make a proposition to you. I have been</p>
<p class="p1">thinking that we ought not to finish every day without remembering and</p>
<p class="p1">returning thanks to our Heavenly Father for His daily bounties,</p>
<p class="p1">protection and mercies to us, and asking a continuance of the same</p>
<p class="p1">blessings; and I think we should not dare to lie down and commit</p>
<p class="p1">ourselves to that helpless sleep that so resembles death, without</p>
<p class="p1">confessing to our Lord the sins we have committed against Him during the</p>
<p class="p1">day, imploring His forgiveness of them, and asking His watchful care</p>
<p class="p1">over us during the darkness of the night and the defencelessness of</p>
<p class="p1">sleep. Don’t you think so?”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Yes, yes, mist’ess, we do, we do indeed,” answered several of the elder</p>
<p class="p1">negroes, clearly—while a modest murmur of assent ran through the</p>
<p class="p1">assembly. The negroes are strongly inclined to worship, and ever ready</p>
<p class="p1">to co-operate in anything of that sacred character.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Catherine resumed—</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“We should each do this in private by our own bedsides, but we should</p>
<p class="p1">also do it together as a household—as the creatures of one God, the</p>
<p class="p1">children of one Father.” She paused a moment in thought, and then spoke</p>
<p class="p1">again. “I have been also reflecting that you ought all to know more of</p>
<p class="p1">the Bible than you have as yet had any opportunity of knowing. And I</p>
<p class="p1">think that most of you would be pleased to know more.” She paused for an</p>
<p class="p1">answer.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Yes, yes, mist’ess, we do,” chimed in many eager voices, old and young.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“I know you do. Well, then, henceforth we will assemble in this room</p>
<p class="p1">every evening just before bed time, and as a household of the Lord, a</p>
<p class="p1">family of one Father, spend a short time together in reading and hearing</p>
<p class="p1">the Holy Scriptures, and in prayer. In beginning to read the Bible with</p>
<p class="p1">you, I shall commence with the first chapter of the New Testament, and</p>
<p class="p1">read a chapter every night, until we regularly read it through. And</p>
<p class="p1">afterwards, in the same manner, we will go through David’s Psalms and</p>
<p class="p1">the Prophets.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Catherine finished and sat down, made a sign for silence, and opened the</p>
<p class="p1">New Testament and commenced her reading. Never had reader a more</p>
<p class="p1">attentive or interested audience. She passed over the long, hard</p>
<p class="p1">genealogical table in the first part of the chapter, and began with the</p>
<p class="p1">Angel’s visit to the Virgin Mary, and read also the second chapter,</p>
<p class="p1">describing the birth and infancy of the Saviour, sometimes stopping to</p>
<p class="p1">give explanations, which she knew the simplicity of her audience made</p>
<p class="p1">necessary. The family service was concluded with a prayer, and the</p>
<p class="p1">servants dismissed.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">And this evening service became thenceforth a daily practice. And</p>
<p class="p1">Catherine’s people learned more of the life and doctrines of the Saviour</p>
<p class="p1">from her, than they would have acquired in a lifetime’s attendance upon</p>
<p class="p1">learned ministers, who preach only for the educated.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">On Monday morning, Catherine entered upon her assumed duty of overseer.</p>
<p class="p1">And, never were the affairs of a plantation better administered than by</p>
<p class="p1">her. Her “good will was to it,” and all her faculties brought to bear</p>
<p class="p1">upon the business. And although she kept a firm hold upon the reins of</p>
<p class="p1">government, exacted the complete fulfillment of every duty, and kept</p>
<p class="p1">steadily at their post every man and woman, yet never was a mistress</p>
<p class="p1">more beloved and venerated. And certainly never was one so faithfully</p>
<p class="p1">served. All subordinates need—not harsh nor lax government—but a steady,</p>
<p class="p1">systematic, rational government, which they can understand and be</p>
<p class="p1">satisfied with, and such an one was that of Catherine. Her</p>
<p class="p1">administration was for her people a very wholesome change from the</p>
<p class="p1">capricious tyranny of the late overseer, who had been accustomed to</p>
<p class="p1">permit the utmost license and laxity among the laborers for four or five</p>
<p class="p1">days, and then, growing alarmed, to hurry and worry, and drive and</p>
<p class="p1">maltreat them for a week, to make up for lost time. Catherine’s</p>
<p class="p1">government was regular, firm, just and merciful. And she was loved,</p>
<p class="p1">respected and served accordingly. There were some exceptions, but they</p>
<p class="p1">were very few and unimportant, and soon fell under the general rule.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">And thus, in the perfect performance of every duty, domestic and social,</p>
<p class="p1">that devolved upon her as wife, friend, mistress and Christian,</p>
<p class="p1">Catherine passed the winter. The spring brought the usual accession of</p>
<p class="p1">busy work, and she gave herself up to its direction with untiring energy</p>
<p class="p1">and activity. She prayed, and labored, and trusted in Heaven, and Heaven</p>
<p class="p1">prospered her work, and all went well. Before the first of June, she had</p>
<p class="p1">paid off all those heavy notes, which had been accumulating interest so</p>
<p class="p1">long. There were other heavy debts, but she saw her way clearly through,</p>
<p class="p1">discharging them before the end of the current year.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">But she never, never heard from Major Clifton. He seemed just as lost to</p>
<p class="p1">her as if the grave had received him. She took all the principal</p>
<p class="p1">newspapers, for the sake of keeping the run of the campaign; and oh!</p>
<p class="p1">often her cheeks and very lips paled, and her heart sickened and sunk</p>
<p class="p1">with terror, to read of the awful perils of war, and to think that he</p>
<p class="p1">was exposed to them. But terror was not the only emotion raised by these</p>
<p class="p1">descriptions of engagements. No—her whole soul glowed with patriotic</p>
<p class="p1">ardor, when she read of the gallant repulse of the combined land and</p>
<p class="p1">naval forces of the British, under Admirals Warren and Cockburn, and</p>
<p class="p1">General Sir Sydney Beckwith, from Craney Island, by a mere handful of</p>
<p class="p1">our troops; and her heart swelled with love and enthusiasm, when in the</p>
<p class="p1">same account, she saw her husband’s name mentioned with the highest</p>
<p class="p1">encomiums upon his bravery, discretion, and invaluable services.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Autumn came, bringing along with its other associations intensely</p>
<p class="p1">distinct images of the last sweet, calm days she had passed at</p>
<p class="p1">Hardbargain with her dying mother, and these vivid recollections</p>
<p class="p1">stimulated afresh her devotion and her energy. During her</p>
<p class="p1">administration, to clear the estate of debt, and at its close, to</p>
<p class="p1">restore it unincumbered into the hands of her husband, was now her dear</p>
<p class="p1">object. When the harvest was gathered in, she consulted several of her</p>
<p class="p1">most intelligent and enterprising neighbors, concerning the state of the</p>
<p class="p1">agricultural markets, and afterwards proceeded to Baltimore in person in</p>
<p class="p1">order to obtain the best possible prices for her crops. She succeeded in</p>
<p class="p1">effecting highly advantageous sales, and with the proceeds she returned</p>
<p class="p1">home and paid off several of those heavy debts.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">And so the autumn passed, and winter came, with its leisure, its stormy</p>
<p class="p1">days, and its long nights. Nothing occurred to break the monotony of</p>
<p class="p1">daily life until the last of December, when she collected the half</p>
<p class="p1">year’s rent from Hardbargain, and paid off all the remaining debts,</p>
<p class="p1">except one inconsiderable note of six hundred dollars. On the morning of</p>
<p class="p1">the first of January, she sent as usual to the village post-office for</p>
<p class="p1">her papers. When the boy returned, he handed her a letter directed in</p>
<p class="p1">the hand-writing of Major Clifton. Oh! joy at last!—she tore open the</p>
<p class="p1">envelope, and seized the enclosure—it was nothing but a check upon the</p>
<p class="p1">Bank of Richmond for five hundred dollars. She let it fall unheeded,</p>
<p class="p1">covered her face with her hands, and wept silently. But when her fit of</p>
<p class="p1">silent weeping was over, she arose, took the check, went and collected</p>
<p class="p1">what money she had left in the house, and ordered her carriage and drove</p>
<p class="p1">to L——, and lifted that last note. Then Catherine had the joy of seeing</p>
<p class="p1">the property entirely free from debt.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">And so passed the winter and came the spring of 1814. And still she</p>
<p class="p1">heard nothing from Major Clifton. And since reading the account of his</p>
<p class="p1">gallant conduct on Craney Island, she learned nothing of him. And still</p>
<p class="p1">from her loop-hole of retreat, she anxiously watched the progress of the</p>
<p class="p1">war, seizing upon all the published accounts, and reading them with the</p>
<p class="p1">greatest avidity. How diligently she searched the papers to find his</p>
<p class="p1">name, and how eagerly her eyes darted down upon any officer’s name</p>
<p class="p1">beginning with a C, which always turned out to be Crutchfield, Corbin,</p>
<p class="p1">Carey, anything but Clifton! Oh, how barren was all this war news, after</p>
<p class="p1">all!</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">But Admiral Cockburn’s piratical fleet was now in the Chesapeake,</p>
<p class="p1">spreading devastation and terror through all its islands, coasts, and</p>
<p class="p1">tributary rivers; and every paper was filled with accounts of his</p>
<p class="p1">marauding incursions and savage atrocities, that defied just</p>
<p class="p1">description, much more exaggeration. Hear what a cotemporary historian</p>
<p class="p1">says of him:</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Throughout the waters and shores of the Chesapeake, Admiral Cockburn</p>
<p class="p1">now reigned supreme, ubiquitous and irresistible. The burglaries,</p>
<p class="p1">larcenies, incendiarisms, and mere marauding, perpetrated by Admiral</p>
<p class="p1">Cockburn, were as odious and ignoble, though less bloody and horrible,</p>
<p class="p1">than the inhuman atrocities of the British savages in the West. Slaves</p>
<p class="p1">in large numbers, large quantities of tobacco, furniture, and other</p>
<p class="p1">private property, protected by the laws of war, and seldom taken, even</p>
<p class="p1">if destroyed by land troops, were seized upon by the sea-faring warriors</p>
<p class="p1">with piratical rapacity. The predatory attacks of the enemy in the</p>
<p class="p1">Chesapeake were limited to isolated villages, poor farm-houses, and</p>
<p class="p1">other indefensible objects taken or destroyed. Destruction was the</p>
<p class="p1">punishment proclaimed and executed for resistance. The house and barn</p>
<p class="p1">were burned of whoever fired a shot, or drew a sword in self-defence.</p>
<p class="p1">Many respectable persons in comfortable circumstances were reduced to</p>
<p class="p1">poverty by these depredations. The poor were especial sufferers. With</p>
<p class="p1">shores so indented with creeks and bays, the whole force of a State</p>
<p class="p1">under arms would have been unequal to cope with such overwhelming</p>
<p class="p1">aggressors.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Reading frequently such accounts as this, and even more alarming ones</p>
<p class="p1">than this, is it strange that Catherine sickened with terror and anxiety</p>
<p class="p1">for the safety of him who was exposed to all the horrors of this</p>
<p class="p1">unsparing warfare.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">At length the shock came. It was on the evening of the day after</p>
<p class="p1">harvest-home, and she had given all her people a holyday, even down to</p>
<p class="p1">the messenger whose daily duty it was to bring her papers from the</p>
<p class="p1">post-office, telling him that he might take the whole day, and bring her</p>
<p class="p1">the mail when he returned home at night. Thus, instead of receiving her</p>
<p class="p1">papers, as usual, in the morning, Catherine had to wait until the boy’s</p>
<p class="p1">return in the evening. She was sitting in the spinning-room, awaiting</p>
<p class="p1">the assembling of her servants, whom she had just summoned to evening</p>
<p class="p1">worship, when they all entered, and with them the post-boy, who came up</p>
<p class="p1">and laid before her the single paper that had come that day. She took</p>
<p class="p1">it, to lay aside until after the evening’s devotions were over—but a</p>
<p class="p1">magic name on the outside arrested her attention. She caught up the</p>
<p class="p1">paper, and read in large capitals:</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“ENGAGEMENT AT ST. LEONARD’S. _British forces under Admiral Cockburn</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>repulsed with considerable loss. Major Clifton dangerously wounded._”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">She read no farther—the room swam around her—she reeled, and fell into</p>
<p class="p1">the arms of Henny, who sprang forward to receive her. Her people crowded</p>
<p class="p1">around her, in great anxiety. But only one moment she fainted thus—then</p>
<p class="p1">she recovered, controlled herself, resumed her seat, and after sending</p>
<p class="p1">the servants all back to their places, by a wave of her hand, opened the</p>
<p class="p1">Bible, and commenced the evening’s exercises. Her face was very pale,</p>
<p class="p1">her hands quivered in turning the leaves, and her voice faltered, so as</p>
<p class="p1">to be nearly inaudible, but she persevered, and got through with the</p>
<p class="p1">service, even unto the benediction. After it was all over, she detained</p>
<p class="p1">them a moment, by a gesture, and then said—</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Your master has been dangerously wounded.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Murmurs of surprise, grief and anxiety agitated the assembly, and</p>
<p class="p1">testified to their affectionate concern.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Go now quietly to your homes, and to-morrow perhaps I may be able to</p>
<p class="p1">tell you more.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">They dispersed slowly, turning glances of uneasiness and distress at the</p>
<p class="p1">silent anguish of her countenance.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">She too, went out. How she spent the night is best known to Heaven. In</p>
<p class="p1">the morning when she appeared among her household—the wasted cheeks, the</p>
<p class="p1">sunken eyes, the hollow temples, and the written agony of the brow,</p>
<p class="p1">alone proved the consuming sorrow of her heart.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Jack—I want Jack,” she said, as soon as she reached her parlor. And the</p>
<p class="p1">favorite servant appeared before her. “Jack, I think you love me,” she</p>
<p class="p1">said.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Try me, mist’ess dear, an’ see ef I doesn’t.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“And I think you love your master?”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Ah! my Lor’! Try me—jes on’y try me, mist’ess—dat’s all.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“I wish you to go to him from me.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Oh! do—do—do—_do_ sen’ me, mist’ess! It’s war I longs for to be.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“I shall. The distance is over a hundred miles. You must pick the best</p>
<p class="p1">horse in the stable, and start within an hour, and ride day and night</p>
<p class="p1">until you reach your destination.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“’Deed, mist’ess, I won’t let de grass grow onnerneaf of my feet.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Very well, then, go now—have you had your breakfast?”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Yes, ma’am.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Go now, then, and prepare for your journey, while I write you a pass.</p>
<p class="p1">And when you are quite ready, come to me, and I will give you farther</p>
<p class="p1">directions about your journey.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Jack hastened out—and his mistress remained for a few minutes, with her</p>
<p class="p1">hands pressed to her heart, repeating to herself, with agonizing</p>
<p class="p1">earnestness—</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Would—oh!—would to Heaven, I too, might go.” Soon she started, as with</p>
<p class="p1">sudden recollection, and hurried off to write the pass, and the</p>
<p class="p1">directions about the road. And when in less than half an hour Jack</p>
<p class="p1">appeared before her again, she was ready for him. “Here,” she said, “is</p>
<p class="p1">your pass, and written directions, lest you should forget what I tell</p>
<p class="p1">you.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Nebber fear me forgettin’, mist’ess, dear.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“You must take the road to Alexandria, which is seventy miles from here.</p>
<p class="p1">When you reach that town, take the ferry-boat and cross the Potomac to</p>
<p class="p1">the Maryland side. Then inquire your road to the village of Benedict, on</p>
<p class="p1">the Patuxent, which is thirty or forty miles further down the country.</p>
<p class="p1">When you reach the village, ask the way to St. Leonard’s. Arrived at</p>
<p class="p1">your journey’s end, find Colonel Wadsworth, or Major Stuart, or Captain</p>
<p class="p1">Miller, show your pass and tell your errand, and they will direct you</p>
<p class="p1">where to find your master. Do you understand?”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Yes, mist’ess.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“All this that I have told you is written down here on this piece of</p>
<p class="p1">parchment; take care of it, lest you should forget, and lose your way.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Yes, ma’am, I’ll be berry cautiencious.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“And now listen to me, Jack;” her voice broke down, some emotion seemed</p>
<p class="p1">struggling in her bosom for expression—she quelled it and went on—“When</p>
<p class="p1">you find your master, write to me at once; thank Heaven I taught you to</p>
<p class="p1">write! write then to me at once, and tell me how he is. Will you promise</p>
<p class="p1">me that?”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Faithful, mist’ess—faithful.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“And, Jack, when you have once found him, _be faithful unto death_ to</p>
<p class="p1">him. Never leave him. Nurse him, wait on him, watch over him day and</p>
<p class="p1">night—_do so_, if you love him, Jack;” again the inward struggle choked</p>
<p class="p1">her voice, and when she resumed, it was with broken and faltering</p>
<p class="p1">accents, “and, Jack, attend—take this note—and _when his fever is</p>
<p class="p1">off_—mind you, _when he is calm_—give it to him.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Yes, mist’ess, dear.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“That is all I have to say to you. Now hasten. Good-bye; and may Heaven</p>
<p class="p1">bless and speed you.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">                           </span>THE NIGHT JOURNEY.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">             </span>The heart once broken by the loved,</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">               </span>Is strong to meet the foeman.—MRS. BROWNING.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Nearly a fortnight of extreme anxiety passed away, during which</p>
<p class="p1">Catherine heard nothing from her messenger. On the evening of the</p>
<p class="p1">thirteenth day of his departure, however, a letter was brought to her,</p>
<p class="p1">directed in the well-known, but alas! not very familiar hand-writing of</p>
<p class="p1">Major Clifton. Oh, joy! He was living then, and even well enough to</p>
<p class="p1">write. With a fervent ejaculation of deep gratitude to Heaven, she broke</p>
<p class="p1">the seal. But her face paled as she read—</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">                                    </span>“ON BOARD THE BRITISH SHIP ALBION, }</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">                                                  </span>“August 21st, 1814.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>}</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“CATHERINE:—</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Are you then destined to be forever fatal, not only to me, but to</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>every human creature that is faithful to me? See what your reckless</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>disregard of others’ lives has done!—doomed a poor, fond, faithful</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>creature to a felon’s death! Attend, woman! to what I am about to</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>write. I was not dangerously wounded, as the newspapers reported, but</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>slightly hurt, and taken prisoner, and conveyed on board this, the</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Admiral’s ship—as they did not report. Thus, the poor fellow, whom you</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>sent on this death’s errand, not finding me in the American camp, and</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>hearing that I was a prisoner on board the British fleet, true to your</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>command, to find and communicate with me, and reckless of his own</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>danger, procured a boat at Benedict, and came out alongside this ship.</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>You know the result, as well as I can inform you. The wretched boy was</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>taken and put in irons as a spy, and has been doomed to be hanged at</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>the yard-arm. He only waits the Admiral’s orders for execution. My own</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>inconvenience is nothing beside his cruel fate—yet, nevertheless, I</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>may as well inform you that I, who was upon parole, when your</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>messenger sought to communicate with me, have also to thank your</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>interference for being put under arrest, and nothing but the</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>relaxation of strict discipline, incident upon the departure of the</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>two commanders, and a mere fortuity, affords me the opportunity of</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>writing, and sending this note. Admiral Cockburn and General Ross are</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>now on their march to Washington City. And my object in writing to you</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>is merely this: to assure you, by all my hopes of salvation, that</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>unless you, in your unequaled machiavelism, find some way of saving</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>this boy from death, I will never see, or speak to you again.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">                                                        </span>ARCHER CLIFTON.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Still clasping the letter, her hand and head fell with a gesture of</p>
<p class="p1">utter despair.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Why, what’s de matter, Miss Kate, honey? no bad news, I trus’,” said</p>
<p class="p1">Henny.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">A deep, heart-breaking sob only answered her.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“My goodness, Miss Kate, deary, what is it den? is marster dead? Oh,</p>
<p class="p1">deary me, Miss Kate, chile, don’t keep on looking dat a way—’deed, you</p>
<p class="p1">puts a scare on to me!—don’t! Sider how it’s de Lord’s will, honey, an’</p>
<p class="p1">let de tears come, let de tears come, chile! _Do_, honey. ’Deed,</p>
<p class="p1">troubles like de measles; ef it don’t break out, it strikes in an’ kills</p>
<p class="p1">you dead—”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">A gasp from Catherine, and a gesture imploring silence, while she</p>
<p class="p1">spanned her temples with both hands, and tried to think clearly.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“My gracious, Miss Kate, don’t look so ghashly, honey—don’t. _Is_</p>
<p class="p1">marster dead, sure enough?”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“He’s not dead, he’s not dead,” said Catherine, huskily, while she waved</p>
<p class="p1">her hand for peace.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Well, den, honey, long as der’s life der’s hope, an’ no ’casion for</p>
<p class="p1">’spair. Is he berry bad, honey?”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“He’s well—well,” said Catherine, in the same tone.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Well, den, long as he’s well, what ’casion you take on so, honey——Oh!</p>
<p class="p1">my Lor’—taint—taint poor brother Jack as anything’s happened to?”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Oh, Henny! Your master and Jack have both been taken prisoners by</p>
<p class="p1">Admiral Cockburn!”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Oh, Miss Kate! Oh, my Lor’, Miss Kate! An’ dey do tell me how he eats</p>
<p class="p1">his prisoners ’live,” exclaimed Henny, falling down into a chair,</p>
<p class="p1">flinging her check apron over her head, and beginning to cry.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Almost heedless of her handmaid’s violent demonstrations of grief and</p>
<p class="p1">terror, Catherine walked up and down the floor, with her hands clasped</p>
<p class="p1">around her temples, in the very agony of thought. To save the boy from</p>
<p class="p1">death—_how_ was she, at that remote distance, to save him? Oh! it seemed</p>
<p class="p1">a mockery, a snare, to put forgiveness upon such an impracticable</p>
<p class="p1">condition! Yet she thought him no setter of snares. She thought over the</p>
<p class="p1">whole of the letter, searching for a _hint_; she needed not to look at</p>
<p class="p1">it again—every line and word was burned in upon her brain and heart—she</p>
<p class="p1">thought over the whole of it, earnestly searching for a clue to</p>
<p class="p1">action—she found it at length in the phrases, “He only waits the</p>
<p class="p1">Admiral’s order for execution,” and “Admiral Cockburn and General Ross</p>
<p class="p1">are now on their march to Washington City.” She thought if she could see</p>
<p class="p1">the Admiral, she might yet save his life—of so little worth as a</p>
<p class="p1">sacrifice to the enemy, but of such inestimable value to her. The date</p>
<p class="p1">of the letter was the twenty-first—this day was the twenty-third. “Oh!</p>
<p class="p1">he is probably executed by this time,” said Despondency. “But possibly</p>
<p class="p1">not,” said Hope. She tried to think clearly, to separate the dreadful</p>
<p class="p1">chaos of thought and passion, and to weigh and adjust circumstances, so</p>
<p class="p1">as she might decide and act promptly. Admiral Cockburn and General Ross</p>
<p class="p1">must be near Washington, if they had not already reached the city.</p>
<p class="p1">Washington was two full day’s journey from her home, but every hour was</p>
<p class="p1">precious, for life and death might hang upon it. She could perform the</p>
<p class="p1">journey in a day and night. Her resolution was taken. Going up to where</p>
<p class="p1">Henny sat crying, and rocking herself backward and forward, she said—</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Rise, Henny, and go and tell James to saddle my horse, _my rough coated</p>
<p class="p1">pony_, Henny, he is the strongest and the fleetest, and bring him around</p>
<p class="p1">to the door.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Oh, Miss Kate! does you think he’ll eat ’em sure ’nough?”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“What do you mean, Henny—are you crazy?”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Admirable Cockbu’n, honey. Does you think he’ll eat Marse Archy an’</p>
<p class="p1">brother Jack, sure ’nough? I hopes not, ’cause you see, chile, brother</p>
<p class="p1">Jack, he’s so poor an’ lean, an’ Marse Archer, he mus’ be tough an’</p>
<p class="p1">stringy ’nough, too long o’ all dis yer warfarin’, but Lor’, ’haps he’ll</p>
<p class="p1">think der good ’nough for sojers rations, and give ’em to dem.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Henny that is all a notion.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“’Bout der eaten ’em, honey?”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Yes, yes—_don’t_ stop me now, Henny! hasten! hasten! quick! quick,</p>
<p class="p1">Henny! Have my pony caught, and then hurry back to me.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“But, Miss Kate, are you sure?”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Yes, yes, I’m sure. Oh! hurry, hurry!”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">The woman went out, and Catherine sat down and penned a hasty note to</p>
<p class="p1">her neighbor, the down-east tenant of Hardbargain, requesting him to</p>
<p class="p1">give a slight supervision of affairs at White Cliffs during her absence</p>
<p class="p1">for a few days. By the time she had sealed and directed it, Henny</p>
<p class="p1">re-appeared.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Go fetch my riding-dress, Henny,” was her next prompt command.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“My goodness, Miss Kate, where—”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Go, Henny, at once, and don’t stay to question me.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">The maid obeyed, and her mistress rang the bell, and gave the note she</p>
<p class="p1">had written to a boy, to carry to Hardbargain.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">As he left the room, Henny entered it with the riding habit.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Help me on with it at once, Henny,” said Catherine, meeting her.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“My goodness, Miss Kate! you to be goin’ out this time o’ night, an’</p>
<p class="p1">we-dem in so much trouble. You didn’ ax me to tell nobody who wur to</p>
<p class="p1">wait on you; but Jeemes, he’s gettin’ ready.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“No, no, I don’t want anybody.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Dear me, mist’ess, honey, where’s you gwine?”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Didn’t I tell you? To Washington City.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“To Washington?” exclaimed Henny, letting the dress fall from her hands,</p>
<p class="p1">and looking up in stupor.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Yes, yes, didn’t I tell you—to Washington, to see Admiral Cockburn, and</p>
<p class="p1">save your brother. I do not believe of Cockburn—I never believe of any</p>
<p class="p1">one—as ill as is reported of them, and I think if I go and make a proper</p>
<p class="p1">representation to him, I shall be able to save Jack.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Henny stood gazing at her mistress in the same stupor.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Come, come, Henny! give me the other sleeve around here,” said</p>
<p class="p1">Catherine, impatiently.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Still Henny stood and stared in a stupor, until suddenly all her muscles</p>
<p class="p1">and limbs gave way, and she sank down before her mistress, embraced her</p>
<p class="p1">knees, looked up into her face, and said, in tones of earnest, deep</p>
<p class="p1">affection—</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“_Don’t_ go, mist’ess, _don’t_ go—don’t trust yerse’f long o’ Admirable</p>
<p class="p1">Cockburn an’ his hang-gallows sojers. _Don’t._”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“I must, Henny.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“_Oh! no, no._ Memorize what happened at Raison River, an’ at Ham’ton,</p>
<p class="p1">how dey nyder spared sexes nor ages—nyder ole paralytic men nor little</p>
<p class="p1">babies, nor der young moders—dem leastes’ ob all. Don’t mist’ess, dear.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“I _must_ Henny. It is the only chance of saving your brother.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Oh, dear me! Oh, my heart’s ready for to break; but nebber mind—don’t</p>
<p class="p1">go, mist’ess, don’t go. Let him die, mist’ess, tain’t nothin’ only _but_</p>
<p class="p1">death arter all! an’ Admirable Cockburn, ’save his funnelly soul, can’t</p>
<p class="p1">do nuffin’ ’tall _but_ kill him. An’, poor fellow, he hadn’ long to live</p>
<p class="p1">no how, wid a’sumption in his breas’, an’ so it on’y comes a little</p>
<p class="p1">sooner an’ a little deffunt like. Don’t go, Miss Kate, dear, let him</p>
<p class="p1">die. I’se his sister, an’ I’se been a mammy to him, but I sez so, an’</p>
<p class="p1">_he’d_ say so, too, brother Jack would, ef he could on’y speak long o’</p>
<p class="p1">you! Sure he’d lay down his life willin’, an’ so would us all, sooner</p>
<p class="p1">’an you should fall in wid Admirable Cockburn.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“I know it, Henny! I know it! Don’t talk to me any longer, though every</p>
<p class="p1">word you say but fixes my resolution to go.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Oh, Miss Kate! oh! _don’t, don’t_,” exclaimed Henny, clasping her</p>
<p class="p1">knees, and repeating all the arguments and entreaties she had used</p>
<p class="p1">before. But Catherine was firm as sad.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“If you _mus’_ make an effort, sen’ a messenger long of a note, Miss</p>
<p class="p1">Kate. Dar! do dat—now dat’s a good trought.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Ah, Heaven forbid! I have had enough of risking poor ignorant</p>
<p class="p1">creatures, who cannot keep themselves out of danger.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Well, den, Miss Kate, _who_ is you gwine for to take long o’ you, to</p>
<p class="p1">wait on you, chile?”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“There, give me my hat, Henny.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Yes, honey, _who’s_ you gwine to take wid you?”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“I told you no one, Henny—where are my gloves?”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Here dey is, honey. Oh, mist’ess, dat’s susanside, an’ nothin’ ’tall</p>
<p class="p1">else. Take Jeemes ’long o’ you! He’s brave as a lion—comes to ’fendin’</p>
<p class="p1">at _you_.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“No, James would need rest and food on the journey—I shall require—I</p>
<p class="p1">shall stop for neither. Besides there is not a horse here who could bear</p>
<p class="p1">his weight continuously for so long a journey. My strong little mountain</p>
<p class="p1">pony, I think, may carry my light weight to the journey’s end with very</p>
<p class="p1">little stopping.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Oh, Miss Kate! ’deed I shall pray for you.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Yes, do, Henny—that is the only way in which you can help me. Come, go</p>
<p class="p1">with me out.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Stay, mist’ess, stay one minute! Ise trought ob anoder trought.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Well?”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Long as you will go onattended, please don’t be ’noyed at what I’m</p>
<p class="p1">gwine to say.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Only be quick, Henny, that is all.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Well, den, ’long as you will go widout any ’fence or ’tection—”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Except the Lord, Henny.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Yes, honey, sure ’nough—’cept de Lord’s—hadn’t you better put</p>
<p class="p1">on—hem—a-hem—male boy’s clothes?”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“_What?_”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Wouldn’t it be more of a ’tection to you? Now, der’s a suit in de</p>
<p class="p1">house, you calls to min’, as ’ill jus’ fit you. Dem as ’longed to Miss</p>
<p class="p1">Georgy, when she were a masquerade-play-actorin’ here wid de city folks,</p>
<p class="p1">here one Christmas. Dey’d fit you to a tee.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“No, thank you, Henny!”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“You ain’t mad ’long o’ me for sayin’ of it, is you, Miss Kate?”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Mad? Poor girl! No, Henny.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Nor likewise ’noyed in yer feelin’s?”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“No, no, you did but mistake,” answered Catherine, getting into her</p>
<p class="p1">saddle, while James held the pony, and Henny affectionately arranged the</p>
<p class="p1">riding skirt around her feet and handed her the whip.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“There, there, that will do; good-bye, all of you,” said Catherine,</p>
<p class="p1">feverishly.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Henny burst into loud wailing. Catherine paused and laid her hand upon</p>
<p class="p1">her shoulder, silencing her while she said—</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“My poor girl, do not fear. I have committed myself to the Lord! I am in</p>
<p class="p1">His hands. I trust in Him, else I should not dare do this which seems to</p>
<p class="p1">you so much like madness. I trust in Him, and no evil can befall me.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“But oh! mist’ess, mist’ess! If you should arter al’ perish!”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“If I perish, I perish!—it will be no evil if the Lord permits it!”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“I doesn’t b’lieve de Lord am gwine fur to ’mit it! I feels safe ’bout</p>
<p class="p1">young mist’ess, _I_ does! I b’lieves how ef Admirable Cockburn or any of</p>
<p class="p1">his jail-birds was to come fur to sturve Mist’ess, trustin’ in Hebben as</p>
<p class="p1">she does, how a thunderbolt would strike him down sooner, an’ she as</p>
<p class="p1">puts her trus’ in de Lord, should come to any harm.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Yes, or a yethquake, if ne’ssary!” exclaimed the more ardent Henny. “I</p>
<p class="p1">ain’t ’feard for you no longer, mist’ess dear! Hebben is wid you!”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Catherine waved her hand in adieu, gave reins to her pony which bounded</p>
<p class="p1">beneath her, and seemed to fly over the lawn. She was fevered,</p>
<p class="p1">excited—“mad inspired,” say either. Night was closing darkly around her,</p>
<p class="p1">but its sedative shadows had no power to soothe her excited nerves—the</p>
<p class="p1">dews were falling, but they had no efficacy to cool her fevered veins; a</p>
<p class="p1">long journey lay before her, but its length could not discourage her;</p>
<p class="p1">dangers were thickly strown about her path, but they could not appall</p>
<p class="p1">her; her only desire, her only anxiety, was to reach her destination in</p>
<p class="p1">season, if possible, to rescue this boy from death, because he was dear</p>
<p class="p1">to Clifton—dearer than she herself, his wife, was, she now thought; and</p>
<p class="p1">now her life itself seemed of little worth, since the hope that was</p>
<p class="p1">life’s earthly end, was laid low. Her only remaining hope was to save</p>
<p class="p1">this life—her only remaining fear, to fail in doing so.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Her path, for many miles, lay through the deep, interminable wilderness</p>
<p class="p1">of forest, that, rising and falling with the low mountain ranges,</p>
<p class="p1">extended over more than half the county. Her path was so narrow, and the</p>
<p class="p1">branches of the trees often so low and interlaced, that a single start</p>
<p class="p1">of her horse, or a single moment’s hesitation to bow her head, might</p>
<p class="p1">have dashed her brains out against the intersecting branches of the</p>
<p class="p1">trees. And in the deep darkness of the night, and in the despairing</p>
<p class="p1">absence of her perceptive faculties, this danger beset her every</p>
<p class="p1">instant. But she rode on, like a monomaniac, strangely heedless, and,</p>
<p class="p1">like a somnambulist, strangely preserved. As night deepened, and</p>
<p class="p1">lowered, and thickened around her in the awful depths of the wilderness,</p>
<p class="p1">the distant howl of the hungry wolf, the nearer cry of the fierce wild</p>
<p class="p1">cat, and once the more fearful whistle-signal of some outlawed desperado</p>
<p class="p1">fell upon her ear. But even these appalling sounds struck no terror to a</p>
<p class="p1">heart, stunned by despair into insensibility to danger. And she rode on</p>
<p class="p1">through these terrific perils, strangely unconscious, and strangely</p>
<p class="p1">protected.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">At length, as she descended the last steep, and drew near to the</p>
<p class="p1">outskirts of the wilderness, the lights of the small village of L——</p>
<p class="p1">gleamed through the interstices of the woods—appearing and disappearing,</p>
<p class="p1">jack-o’-lanternlike, until she emerged from the forest and came full</p>
<p class="p1">upon the hamlet. It was so late at night, that all the houses were shut</p>
<p class="p1">and dark, and the only lights were those she had seen in the forest,—the</p>
<p class="p1">lights of the stage and post-office. She passed like a meteor through</p>
<p class="p1">the gloomy street, eliciting only a “What the deuce was that?” from a</p>
<p class="p1">loiterer in the stage-office, who had seen her flight, and emerged again</p>
<p class="p1">upon an open plain, over which her road lay for many miles. Another</p>
<p class="p1">village gleamed up from the plains—was reached, passed, and left far</p>
<p class="p1">behind with the same lightning-like speed.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">She rode all night, less sensible to danger and fatigue than the hardy</p>
<p class="p1">little mountain pony that was carrying her light weight, but straining</p>
<p class="p1">every nerve and sinew in the service. The night was deeply dark—the</p>
<p class="p1">clouds thick, heavy and lowering; she had no means of computing time or</p>
<p class="p1">distance, but farms, forests and fields continued to loom, appear and</p>
<p class="p1">vanish, as she fled past them. She watched the East with feverish</p>
<p class="p1">anxiety for day. But still mountain, meadow, and moorland came and went,</p>
<p class="p1">as she approached and hurried by them, and still deep darkness hung like</p>
<p class="p1">a pall over Heaven and earth. Vainly she watched the East, for hamlet,</p>
<p class="p1">village or town in turn was seen and reached and left behind, and still</p>
<p class="p1">a wall of dense blackness blocked up the Orient.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">A new and very serious danger threatened her every instant—her poor</p>
<p class="p1">horse, fatigued nearly to death, was ready to fall, and she did not know</p>
<p class="p1">it. He reeled and tottered, and stumbled and recovered himself many</p>
<p class="p1">times, and she did not see or feel it! nay, she mechanically exerted</p>
<p class="p1">every nerve and sinew to hold him up, and keep him on his feet, while</p>
<p class="p1">totally unconscious of her own exertion. Like a sleep walker was she in</p>
<p class="p1">her deep abstraction.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">She was in a deep forest again riding for life, and the veins in her</p>
<p class="p1">arms were swelled out like cords, with straining to hold the horse up on</p>
<p class="p1">his feet. She could no longer see the Eastern horizon, but it was</p>
<p class="p1">growing lighter, and she knew that morning was dawning. She rode on, and</p>
<p class="p1">on, and on, and at length came out of the forest in time to see the</p>
<p class="p1">level rays of the rising sun striking redly across the fields. The</p>
<p class="p1">windows of a farm-house flashing back the early light gleamed upon her</p>
<p class="p1">vision, and at the same time her horse reeled and fell with her. “Good</p>
<p class="p1">Lord!” “Are you hurt?” “Run here, Tim.” “Call your mist’ess, Peter.”</p>
<p class="p1">“Where are you hurt, lady? can you tell us?”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Catherine awoke as out of a dream, to see many people around her all</p>
<p class="p1">asking questions, and all attempting to extricate her from her saddle.</p>
<p class="p1">She passed her hand across her brow, as was her wont when trying to</p>
<p class="p1">dispel thought, and she looked at them in perplexity.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“My Lord, I’m afraid she’s very much hurt! Can you speak, lady? Where is</p>
<p class="p1">your injury?” said the eldest man of the party, at length, lifting her</p>
<p class="p1">in his arms.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“I—no—I’m not hurt—not the least; is the horse?”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“We don’t know, ma’am; I’m sure it’s a blessed thing you’re not killed</p>
<p class="p1">yourself,” said another of the group, who, with several more, were</p>
<p class="p1">trying to raise the pony upon his legs.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Pray put me down upon my feet. Thank you. I’m not hurt. How far is</p>
<p class="p1">Washington City from this place?” said Catherine, as she stood watching</p>
<p class="p1">her horse.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Good forty miles, lady. I don’t think he’s hurt, but poor fellow, he’s</p>
<p class="p1">trembling with fatigue,” said the farmer, answering her, and then</p>
<p class="p1">examining the horse, which was raised at last and stood trembling and</p>
<p class="p1">blowing.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Can he take me to Washington to-day?” asked Catherine, as she leaned</p>
<p class="p1">against the fence for support.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“_He?_—Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha! Why look at him, lady: Besides, can you go</p>
<p class="p1">there yourself anyhow? Why you’re ready to drop now! Better go in and</p>
<p class="p1">let the old woman put you to bed and give you some breakfast.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“It is true I’m very stiff and weary—having ridden all night. But I must</p>
<p class="p1">reach Washington without delay; there is one I care about under sentence</p>
<p class="p1">of death. If I reach there in time, I may get a reprieve and save him. I</p>
<p class="p1">_must_ go to-day.” Catherine spoke this, frequently pausing for breath.</p>
<p class="p1">When she ceased—</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Some of her ‘lations gwine to be hung, an’ she gwine to see President</p>
<p class="p1">Madison to get him off! May depen’, that’s it!” whispered one farm</p>
<p class="p1">laborer to another.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Can you let me have a horse to take me there to-day? I will pay</p>
<p class="p1">twice—ten times his value,” said Catherine, raising her heavy eyelids to</p>
<p class="p1">the old farmer’s kind face.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Lady, I’ll let you have another horse in two hours from this, on</p>
<p class="p1">condition that you go in to my old woman and take some refreshment, and</p>
<p class="p1">lie down to rest for that time. And not a minute sooner, and not on any</p>
<p class="p1">other terms whatsoever, even if it was your father was going to be</p>
<p class="p1">hanged—would I let you have a horse; because I see very clearly that,</p>
<p class="p1">unless you take some rest, you will drop down dead before you get a mile</p>
<p class="p1">farther on your road.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“It is true—it is the voice of Providence, I think—I thank you very</p>
<p class="p1">much; I will rest. Please take care of my poor pony.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“He shall be looked after, lady. Take my arm.” And the worthy farmer</p>
<p class="p1">drew Catherine’s arm within his own, and carefully and respectfully</p>
<p class="p1">supported her to the house, where he gave her into the charge of his</p>
<p class="p1">wife, saying, “Here, wait upon this lady, honey! be a mother to her,</p>
<p class="p1">honey! for she’s sorrowfully in want of one.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">The farmer’s wife placed her in a stuffed chair, drew off her gloves,</p>
<p class="p1">untied her hat and removed it, unfastened her spencer, and asked her if</p>
<p class="p1">she would have breakfast, which was just ready to go on the table.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“No, thank you. You are very kind. The Lord reward you. But—rest, I want</p>
<p class="p1">only rest,” said Catherine, ready to swoon, for the sense of fatigue was</p>
<p class="p1">growing upon her.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Yes, _rest_, that’s all she wants, or rather that’s the most she wants</p>
<p class="p1">now! Put her to bed! let her sleep for two hours, and have a cup of</p>
<p class="p1">strong coffee and a broiled chicken ready for her when she wakes. That</p>
<p class="p1">will set her up again, and help her to reach her journey’s end,” said</p>
<p class="p1">the kind-hearted man.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Supported by the farmer’s wife, Catherine was guided up the stairs to a</p>
<p class="p1">cool and quiet room, where she dropped upon the bed. No sooner had her</p>
<p class="p1">head touched the pillow, than the room, the white-washed wall, blue</p>
<p class="p1">window-curtains, the evergreens on the whitened fire-place, the picture</p>
<p class="p1">of the annunciation over the mantle-piece—all reeled around her senses</p>
<p class="p1">as a vision, and wheeled off, carrying with them the outside world and</p>
<p class="p1">all consciousness of being.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">To her, existence was blotted out for two hours.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Wake up, lady: wake up! your breakfast is ready, and so is your horse!”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Catherine started up at the voice of her landlady, and gazed around,</p>
<p class="p1">bewildered. Then memory flashed upon her, and she sprung to her feet,</p>
<p class="p1">and began hastily and nervously to fasten her habit.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Here is water, lady, and napkins—and is there anything else I can bring</p>
<p class="p1">you?”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“No, thank you, you are very good.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“How do you find yourself?”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Better—I think. How long have I slept?”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Just two hours. I wished to let you lie longer, but my dear old fellow</p>
<p class="p1">insisted on keeping his word with you.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“I’m glad he did. It was very needful. But you are kind, and I thank</p>
<p class="p1">you.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Catherine bathed her head and face, and the good hostess combed and</p>
<p class="p1">arranged her hair, and fastened her habit and took her down stairs,</p>
<p class="p1">where a comfortable breakfast awaited her. It was yet but seven o’clock,</p>
<p class="p1">and the farmer assured her that she had time enough to reach Washington</p>
<p class="p1">by night-fall, and that she would be far better able to do it from</p>
<p class="p1">having had this rest. She hastily swallowed a few mouthfuls of food,</p>
<p class="p1">drank a cup of strong coffee, that gave her a sort of fictitious</p>
<p class="p1">strength, and then arose from the table and quickly prepared to resume</p>
<p class="p1">her journey. The good woman followed her with many kind wishes, and the</p>
<p class="p1">good man set her in her saddle, and while adjusting her comfortably,</p>
<p class="p1">gave directions about the nearest way to W——, the next considerable town</p>
<p class="p1">upon the road. Then he gave her the reins, and prayed God to bless her.</p>
<p class="p1">She thanked her kind hosts earnestly again, put whip to her horse and</p>
<p class="p1">galloped away, leaving her valuable pony in pledge.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">The farm-house, with its garden, orchard and vineyard, barns,</p>
<p class="p1">wheat-stack and stubble-fields vanished behind her flying steed. The</p>
<p class="p1">country was now open, and she flew on and on before the wind. And now</p>
<p class="p1">she had entered the forest, and she hurried through its deep shadows,</p>
<p class="p1">flecked with golden sun-glances. When she emerged again, and found</p>
<p class="p1">herself in the open meadows, it was high noon, and the August sun was</p>
<p class="p1">pouring down his burning rays with intolerable power. But on and on she</p>
<p class="p1">rode, unconscious of suffering in herself, and unheedful of the fatigue</p>
<p class="p1">of her panting and perspiring steed.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">It was two hours past noon when she reached the town of W——, and at the</p>
<p class="p1">very first inn on the suburbs her horse stopped, of his own will, nor</p>
<p class="p1">could she, with all her efforts, persuade or force him to budge a step.</p>
<p class="p1">A boy, a colored woman, and then the landlord, his wife and all the</p>
<p class="p1">children came out, to see a lady riding, unattended, who could not make</p>
<p class="p1">her horse go.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“He wants food and drink, I suppose,” said Catherine, to the landlord,</p>
<p class="p1">who at last came to offer her aid. And then she alighted, and requesting</p>
<p class="p1">the host to have the animal attended, very quickly, followed the</p>
<p class="p1">landlady, who conducted her into the rustic parlor. She was now so</p>
<p class="p1">fatigued and stiffened, that the act of standing or walking was really</p>
<p class="p1">painful, so she sank down upon the lounge, and declining all the</p>
<p class="p1">landlady’s offers of refreshment, waited a weary half hour, while her</p>
<p class="p1">horse was feeding. At the end of that time, she mounted again, and</p>
<p class="p1">resumed her journey. She passed through the town, and over the wooded</p>
<p class="p1">hills that environed it on the east, and came down upon the plains. The</p>
<p class="p1">heat of the afternoon was of that close, breathless, insufferable kind,</p>
<p class="p1">that always forebodes an awful storm. The sense of suffering was</p>
<p class="p1">beginning to force itself upon her, and as for the animal she rode, she</p>
<p class="p1">could not, by any means, coax or drive him beyond a walk. Then her mind</p>
<p class="p1">became again anxiously concentrated upon the end of her journey, to the</p>
<p class="p1">total exclusion of all other thought, and all sense. It was in this</p>
<p class="p1">state that she arrived at the foot of a steep hill, covered with</p>
<p class="p1">copse-wood, ascended its top, descended the other side, and reached a</p>
<p class="p1">small river at its foot. She drew up her feet, doubled her riding-skirt</p>
<p class="p1">up over the horse’s shoulders, and guided him into the ford, and—with</p>
<p class="p1">the water splashing around, and rising even to the animal’s neck, she</p>
<p class="p1">crossed the river—so mechanically, so unconsciously, that had people</p>
<p class="p1">asked her, thereafter, whether she had forded a stream in her journey,</p>
<p class="p1">she could not have told them.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">The sun was declining to his setting, and the sky was heavy with clouds,</p>
<p class="p1">while still the air was close, sultry, stifling and oppressive.</p>
<p class="p1">Everything indicated the approach before long of a tremendous tornado.</p>
<p class="p1">The shades of evening were falling thickly around her when she was</p>
<p class="p1">passing through the dense, low-lying forest south-west of Washington.</p>
<p class="p1">When she emerged from its deep obscurity and came out into the open</p>
<p class="p1">country, an alarming phenomenon arrested her attention; the eastern</p>
<p class="p1">horizon was luridly lighted by a low, dull, red glow, like the earliest</p>
<p class="p1">dawn of a wintry morning. Her road led directly towards this murky</p>
<p class="p1">light, and her eyes were fascinated to it. As she rode and gazed, the</p>
<p class="p1">blood-tinged illumination seemed to glow and brighten on her vision, and</p>
<p class="p1">presently after, began to send up meteoric streams of fire towards the</p>
<p class="p1">clouds. As the distance lessened between herself and the awful</p>
<p class="p1">conflagration, it began to illumine her path more and more distinctly</p>
<p class="p1">and fearfully, until every object for miles around was plainly visible</p>
<p class="p1">in the lurid glare. And then at last Catherine recognized it for a</p>
<p class="p1">burning city—the city of Washington wrapped in flames!</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">On descending the road towards the Potomac, a scene difficult to</p>
<p class="p1">describe met her view. All up and down the river and on either shore,</p>
<p class="p1">were seen in the red glare multitudes of fugitives—some seeking to</p>
<p class="p1">cross, some in boats on the water, and some landed and hurrying in</p>
<p class="p1">disorder up the country. Soon after this, she met great numbers of</p>
<p class="p1">terrified women and children, flying from their desolated homes. The</p>
<p class="p1">greatest possible consternation and confusion prevailed among these</p>
<p class="p1">panic-stricken fugitives. The most terrific reports were rife: That the</p>
<p class="p1">enemy were in hot pursuit—that the slaves had been incited to revolt,</p>
<p class="p1">and mad with emancipation, and drunk with all manner of licentious</p>
<p class="p1">excess, were perpetrating more horrible and revolting atrocities than</p>
<p class="p1">those which at Hampton, the year before, steeped the country in blood</p>
<p class="p1">and shame.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Rendered by despair senseless as the dead to all those dangers,</p>
<p class="p1">Catherine laboriously pushed and threaded her way down the road, blocked</p>
<p class="p1">up with horses, carriages, foot-passengers, baggage wagons, cattle, and</p>
<p class="p1">all the miscellaneous emptyings of a hastily and fearfully evacuated</p>
<p class="p1">city. As she drew near the Long Bridge, she heard by the frightened talk</p>
<p class="p1">of the flying multitude, that the end of the bridge on the Virginia side</p>
<p class="p1">had been burned to prevent, or at least delay, the pursuit of the enemy.</p>
<p class="p1">She then turned her horse’s head up the course of the river, with the</p>
<p class="p1">intention of crossing by the Georgetown Ferry. She had no trouble in</p>
<p class="p1">picking her way through the thicket under the hills that bordered the</p>
<p class="p1">Potomac from this point, for every minutest object on the way was made</p>
<p class="p1">painfully distinct by the light of the burning city. When nearly</p>
<p class="p1">opposite Georgetown, she descried the ferry-boat put off from the other</p>
<p class="p1">shore, and propelled rapidly across the river. She stopped her horse,</p>
<p class="p1">intending to wait and return with it. In less than five minutes it</p>
<p class="p1">touched the beach, and a carriage with a small party of ladies, escorted</p>
<p class="p1">by a guard of nine cavalry volunteers, landed.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">In the hurried consultation that ensued among them, Catherine learned</p>
<p class="p1">that the party consisted of Mrs. Madison and her friends and attendants,</p>
<p class="p1">flying from the burning Presidential Mansion. When they had turned their</p>
<p class="p1">horses’ heads up the river road, Catherine rode down to the boat, and</p>
<p class="p1">addressed herself to the ferryman, asking to be taken over. The man</p>
<p class="p1">looked at her in astonishment, and when he saw that she was in earnest,</p>
<p class="p1">advised her strongly against the trip, telling her that she had best</p>
<p class="p1">turn rein and ride as fast and as far as possible in the opposite</p>
<p class="p1">direction—that every one had fled or was flying from Washington, that</p>
<p class="p1">the city was in the undisputed possession of the enemy, who were</p>
<p class="p1">demolishing, burning and laying waste the metropolis at pleasure. There</p>
<p class="p1">was no need to tell that—the fact was awfully visible by the light of</p>
<p class="p1">the great conflagration. But Catherine still persisted in her purpose,</p>
<p class="p1">replying to his objections that some one whom she did not wish to desert</p>
<p class="p1">was in the hands of the enemy; and at last prevailed upon him to put her</p>
<p class="p1">across.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">She was landed on the flats west of the city. Here crowds of women and</p>
<p class="p1">children, pale with terror, and weeping and wailing for their ruined</p>
<p class="p1">city and lost homes, waited impatiently to be taken across the river,</p>
<p class="p1">out of the way of more horrible fates, which the atrocious reputation of</p>
<p class="p1">Cockburn and his Cossacks reasonably taught them to dread. Catherine</p>
<p class="p1">left them hurrying in mad confusion into the boat, while she hastened on</p>
<p class="p1">to the very scene of peril from which they were flying. She passed</p>
<p class="p1">swiftly over the low and marshy fields that then lay between the river</p>
<p class="p1">and the heart of the city, and entered upon Twenty-first Street, above</p>
<p class="p1">the War Department, and turned into Pennsylvania Avenue.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">What a scene! Volumes of smoke, as from an enormous volcano, were</p>
<p class="p1">disgorged in massive clouds, and settled like a black canopy over the</p>
<p class="p1">doomed city. The President’s Palace and the Treasury Building, swathed</p>
<p class="p1">in their shrouds of fire, illumined all the scene with terrific</p>
<p class="p1">splendor. Even at the distance of several hundred yards off, her eyes</p>
<p class="p1">ached with the insufferable light and scorching heat. At the distance of</p>
<p class="p1">a mile, the Capitol, wrapped in its mantle of flame, sent forth a</p>
<p class="p1">hail-storm of sparks and burning brands.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">In strange and awful contrast to this appalling progress of destruction,</p>
<p class="p1">was the dread silence that reigned over the falling city. All the</p>
<p class="p1">terror, consternation, hurry and distraction were left without. Here,</p>
<p class="p1">upon the very scene of action, all was comparatively quiet. The houses</p>
<p class="p1">were shut up, and if they contained any inmates, they were hiding in</p>
<p class="p1">obscurity. The streets seemed forsaken by the conquerors, as by the</p>
<p class="p1">conquered. There was no shout of soldiery, no martial music, no sign</p>
<p class="p1">expression of a grand military triumph anywhere, no sound to be heard</p>
<p class="p1">from the powerful enemy in possession, except a distant, dull, heavy,</p>
<p class="p1">monotonous tramp, as of many retreating hoofs. The flames were doing</p>
<p class="p1">their work of destruction in silence, only broken by the occasional</p>
<p class="p1">crash of some falling roof, cupola, or pillar, or some reverberating</p>
<p class="p1">explosion. Catherine passed under the blinding glare and scathing heat</p>
<p class="p1">of the burning Treasury Building, and turning the elbow of the Avenue,</p>
<p class="p1">came upon a sentinel, who instantly levelled his musket and challenged</p>
<p class="p1">her, with “Who goes there?”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“The Admiral,” said Catherine, drawing rein.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">The sentinel lowered his musket with a surly “Pass on,” followed by a</p>
<p class="p1">low, insulting comment. Catherine had merely intended to express her</p>
<p class="p1">errand, and had chanced upon the countersign.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Where shall I find your commander?” she next said.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“The General?”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“No—Admiral Cockburn.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Corporal,” said the soldier, in a low, distinct voice. The Corporal of</p>
<p class="p1">the Guard advanced.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“What did you want, mum?”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“To be conducted to the presence of the Admiral,” answered Catherine,</p>
<p class="p1">with an imploring glance. Perhaps some thing in her countenance moved</p>
<p class="p1">the pity of the officer—perhaps he thought her a sufferer from the</p>
<p class="p1">devastation of the city. At least he volunteered to be her guide, and</p>
<p class="p1">requesting her to accompany him, led the way down the avenue towards the</p>
<p class="p1">Capitol.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Did you know, mum, that a curfew had been proclaimed, and the citizens</p>
<p class="p1">forbidden to appear in the streets after eight o’clock in the evening?”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“No, and if I had, I should have been still obliged to disregard it, for</p>
<p class="p1">a matter of more than life and death hangs upon my interview with the</p>
<p class="p1">Admiral,” replied Catherine, speaking out of the fullness of her heart.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">The distance between the Treasury Building and the Capitol was about one</p>
<p class="p1">mile, and the glare of the conflagration at each end, revealed a line of</p>
<p class="p1">sentinels, posted at regular intervals the whole length of the avenue.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">A ride of ten minutes brought them to the encampment of the enemy on the</p>
<p class="p1">Capitol Hill, east of the burning edifice. Here, indeed, prevailed much</p>
<p class="p1">of the noise and disorder consequent upon the relaxation of discipline</p>
<p class="p1">after a day of severe action. Nearly four thousand men were resting,</p>
<p class="p1">some leaning upon their muskets, some seated upon the grass, and some</p>
<p class="p1">flat upon the ground, in the death-like sleep of drunkenness or</p>
<p class="p1">exhaustion.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">A group of officers, with their gorgeous scarlet and gold laced dresses</p>
<p class="p1">resplendant in the glare, stood watching the progress of the fire.</p>
<p class="p1">Towards these the Corporal conducted Catherine. One from among them</p>
<p class="p1">advanced, laughing coarsely, as he exclaimed—“Who have we got here,</p>
<p class="p1">Corporal?—a woman, by George! and a young and pretty one, too, to judge</p>
<p class="p1">by the pretty figure. You’re welcome, madam. What, afraid? Well, I</p>
<p class="p1">suppose you have formed a terrible opinion of me from the newspapers,</p>
<p class="p1">which delight to represent us all as devils. Never fear me. Satan is not</p>
<p class="p1">half so black as the saints paint him! You shall be far safer under any</p>
<p class="p1">government than under Madison’s. Ross says he makes no war upon letters</p>
<p class="p1">or ladies. Ho, ho, ho! Ross—_he’s_ sentimental, you know! Well! d——</p>
<p class="p1">letters, but _I_ make no war upon ladies either, except with Cupid’s</p>
<p class="p1">weapons—ho, ho, ho, ho, ho! What, afraid still. Come! let’s see your</p>
<p class="p1">face; never saw a shy woman yet that had not a face worth seeing.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Abashed at this manner of address, Catherine hung her head, until the</p>
<p class="p1">Corporal whispered—</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Rear Admiral Cockburn.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Then she stole a glance at the speaker.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">A flashy, overdressed, yet slovenly person, a florid complexion, a</p>
<p class="p1">clear, mirthful, audacious blue eye—a sensual mouth, and a free,</p>
<p class="p1">dashing, insolent manner, marked the licensed Pirate of the Chesapeake,</p>
<p class="p1">and the boon companion of the profligate Prince of Wales.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“What, shy yet! By your leave, my dear!” said the Admiral, chucking his</p>
<p class="p1">hand under Catherine’s chin, and raising her face. Poor Kate’s face, as</p>
<p class="p1">well as her hair and her dress, was stained with dust and tears and</p>
<p class="p1">perspiration, and her features were pale and haggard with sorrow,</p>
<p class="p1">anxiety and extreme fatigue. The profligate dropped her chin with a</p>
<p class="p1">start, as if it had burnt him, exclaiming—</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Whisht! Ugh! Brownies and kelpies, and witches on broomsticks! Oh! ho,</p>
<p class="p1">ho, ho, ho, ho! _Ugh!_ what a face! Here, Corporal, I pass her over to</p>
<p class="p1">you; you seem to be kindly disposed. There is no accounting for tastes,</p>
<p class="p1">so—Oh! ho, ho, ho, ho, ho! I make you a present of her. _Oh-h!_ where</p>
<p class="p1">can I find a dozen pretty girls to get the cross out of my eyes?”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Mortified, repulsed, despairing, Catherine stood by her horse, with one</p>
<p class="p1">arm thrown around his neck, and her head resting upon it.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">A low hum of voices around her, seemingly incident upon some one’s</p>
<p class="p1">arrival on the scene of action, and then a sweet, deep-toned voice near</p>
<p class="p1">her, inquiring—</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Can we be so happy as to serve you in any way, lady, I should be most</p>
<p class="p1">grateful for the opportunity. To be able to render any service is always</p>
<p class="p1">a most soothing amelioration to me of the harsh duties of war.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Major-General Ross,” whispered the friendly Corporal, stooping to her</p>
<p class="p1">ear.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Catherine raised her head, and saw, bending towards her, a very handsome</p>
<p class="p1">man, in the early prime of life, of a grave, sweet, thoughtful, and</p>
<p class="p1">somewhat melancholy expression of countenance, who regarding her with</p>
<p class="p1">respectful sympathy, repeated his offers of service, saying—</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“If I am so fortunate as to be able to assist you, lady, pray do not</p>
<p class="p1">hesitate a moment to command me.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Thank you, thank you—I—wished to speak with the Admiral—but—”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“With _me_! oh, ho, ho, ho, ho! I beg your pardon! I beg to decline the</p>
<p class="p1">honor! Talk to Ross—he’s sentimental, _and_—responsible! the father of a</p>
<p class="p1">family, etc.—‘a married man myself, with several sweet children, and</p>
<p class="p1">venerate the sanctity,’[3] etc. Eh, Ross? Oh, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho!”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Footnote 3:</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Words used by the generous and unfortunate General Ross, while trying</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>to soothe the fears of Mrs. E——</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Speak with me, lady. I shall be most happy to aid you. What is it? Have</p>
<p class="p1">you or yours suffered, or received any injury by our soldiers that I can</p>
<p class="p1">redress? Can I help you in any way?” asked General Ross, in gentle,</p>
<p class="p1">earnest tones.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Yes, yes, I think you may have power to do me a vital service.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Name it, lady. My word is pledged.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“His word is pledged! Oh, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho!—pledged to a</p>
<p class="p1">scare-crow!—pledged to a kelpie!—pledged to a witch on a broomstick! Oh,</p>
<p class="p1">ho, ho, ho, ho, ho! _Oh-h!_” shouted the coarse Admiral.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">The eye of Ross flashed for an instant, but sheathed its fire as he</p>
<p class="p1">turned to Catherine, and, taking her hand respectfully, drew her aside</p>
<p class="p1">from the proximity of the brutal Cockburn, who, in addition to his other</p>
<p class="p1">graces, was now doubly inflamed by drink and triumph.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“A tryste! a tryste with the Queen of the Kelpies! Oh, ho, ho, ho, ho,</p>
<p class="p1">ho!” roared the Admiral, holding his sides, and bending forward to shout</p>
<p class="p1">his insulting laughter, and then stalking off.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Explain, lady. I shall be proud to serve you. Pray have confidence in</p>
<p class="p1">me, madam, and believe in the sincerity of my words,” said General Ross,</p>
<p class="p1">still holding her hand, while she passed her other one slowly to and fro</p>
<p class="p1">across her forehead, as was her habit when embarrassed, trying to clear</p>
<p class="p1">her mind and arrange her thoughts.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">But as soon as she was relieved from the presence of the coarse and</p>
<p class="p1">insolent Cockburn, she recovered breath and self-possession, and spoke</p>
<p class="p1">clearly and to the point.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“I thank you, sir,—I deeply thank you. I will tell you. I heard, in my</p>
<p class="p1">distant mountain home, that my husband, Major Clifton, of the ——</p>
<p class="p1">Regiment of Volunteers, had been dangerously wounded in the action at</p>
<p class="p1">St. Leonard’s. I did not hear that he had also been taken prisoner.</p>
<p class="p1">Believing him to be still in the American camp, and fearing that he</p>
<p class="p1">needed more constant attention than he could get, and feeling very</p>
<p class="p1">anxious to hear directly from him, I sent his favorite servant to find</p>
<p class="p1">him, directing the man to remain with him, and to write me of his state.</p>
<p class="p1">He, this servant, was a poor, rustic negro, sir, totally ignorant of the</p>
<p class="p1">usages of war. When he reached the American camp, he discovered that his</p>
<p class="p1">master was a prisoner on board the British fleet. He procured a boat and</p>
<p class="p1">boarded the Albion. He was taken as a spy, of course, and, to end the</p>
<p class="p1">miserable story, awaits only the orders of Admiral Cockburn to be</p>
<p class="p1">executed. I heard that yesterday evening, and I instantly set off, and</p>
<p class="p1">between that hour and this have ridden more than seventy miles, almost</p>
<p class="p1">without stopping for food or rest, and entered the city to-night alone,</p>
<p class="p1">when all were flying from it, to beg this man’s life from the Admiral.</p>
<p class="p1">Now, you know, _you know_, how vital is my request, my prayer.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“You could not have done more for your father, lady!” replied General</p>
<p class="p1">Ross, with a gentle, earnest wonder on his fine countenance. “You could</p>
<p class="p1">not have done more for your father than you have done for this slave.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Do not wonder, sir. He would have laid down his life for us. But, oh,</p>
<p class="p1">sir! time presses—death threatens!”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Be at peace, lady! The life or death of this slave, of such vital</p>
<p class="p1">importance to you, is really a matter of so little moment to Admiral</p>
<p class="p1">Cockburn, that I have not the slightest hesitation in promising to</p>
<p class="p1">secure for you his pardon and liberation.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Oh, may the Lord forever bless you, sir! I never, never can tell you</p>
<p class="p1">how grateful I am—”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Peace, peace, dear lady. It is absolutely nothing. I would to Heaven I</p>
<p class="p1">could really do anything to merit your kind word and kind remembrance,</p>
<p class="p1">when others are cursing me for what the stern duties of war force me to</p>
<p class="p1">do!”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“I shall ever remember you, sir, with the deepest gratitude.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“And now, Mrs. Clifton, you must have rest and refreshment. My</p>
<p class="p1">head-quarters are at Doctor E——’s. His amiable family are at home. They</p>
<p class="p1">will gladly afford you comfort and assistance. Permit me to conduct you</p>
<p class="p1">thither.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">He replaced her carefully in her saddle, and taking the reins, led her</p>
<p class="p1">horse until they reached the commodious mansion of Doctor E——. Here he</p>
<p class="p1">introduced Mrs. Clifton, who was received with respect and sympathy.</p>
<p class="p1">Leaving her in the care of the kind and hospitable family, he then set</p>
<p class="p1">out to seek Admiral Cockburn.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Catherine was shown to a chamber, and afforded the refreshments of a</p>
<p class="p1">partial bath and food. After which she lay down on a sofa, to rest, and</p>
<p class="p1">await the return of the gentle and generous Ross.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">In about half an hour she was summoned to the parlor, where she found</p>
<p class="p1">him standing. He advanced to meet her, and said—</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Mrs. Clifton, I have the pardon here, but I very much fear—” and his</p>
<p class="p1">face clouded over—“I very much fear it will be too late.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“‘_Too late!_’” echoed Catherine, sinking into a chair, as she repeated</p>
<p class="p1">the saddest words in the language—“Too late. Is he dead?” she asked,</p>
<p class="p1">covering her face with her hands.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“No, Mrs. Clifton, but he has been ordered for execution at eight</p>
<p class="p1">o’clock to-morrow.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“IT IS NOT TOO LATE!” exclaimed Catherine, starting up, with electric</p>
<p class="p1">energy. “Give me—oh! give me the pardon!—I will take it there in time!”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Lady, the distance is over forty miles—and the necessary delays, and</p>
<p class="p1">the dangers that threaten a young female, traveling alone by night,</p>
<p class="p1">through a country infested—”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“_Oh!_ give me the pardon! give it me, I implore you! I will take it</p>
<p class="p1">there safely, and in time! Heaven has protected me through dangers as</p>
<p class="p1">great, and Heaven will protect me through these! Oh, for the love of</p>
<p class="p1">Heaven, do not hesitate! Every moment is inestimable when a ‘_too late_’</p>
<p class="p1">threatens us! Give me the pardon!”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Nay, lady, I can send a courier with the pardon, rather than that you</p>
<p class="p1">should go, for many reasons.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Oh, no, no, your courier would want to stop, to eat and drink—or he</p>
<p class="p1">might fall in with some of our people, and be killed or taken,—or if he</p>
<p class="p1">escaped, through his explanation of his errand—why, that very errand</p>
<p class="p1">would be rendered futile, by the time lost in investigation. _I_ shall</p>
<p class="p1">pause for nothing. Heaven will protect and speed me. Oh! give me the</p>
<p class="p1">pardon. Do not delay! _All_ depends upon promptitude. Alas! excuse my</p>
<p class="p1">importunity! but give me the pardon!”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">General Ross attempted to dissuade her; but neither arguments nor</p>
<p class="p1">persuasions had the least effect upon her resolution. At last, overruled</p>
<p class="p1">by her earnestness, vehemence and faith, he yielded—handed her the</p>
<p class="p1">pardon, and went out to see if he could procure her a fresh horse.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">When he entered again, after a successful search, he found her equipped</p>
<p class="p1">for her second night’s journey, and standing in the midst of her</p>
<p class="p1">astonished hosts. He informed her that her horse was ready, and also</p>
<p class="p1">that he had provided her a guard, to escort her beyond Bladensburg. Then</p>
<p class="p1">she took a hasty and grateful leave of her amiable entertainers, and</p>
<p class="p1">accepting the arm of the Major-General, left the house.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">As General Ross placed her in the saddle, and handed her the reins, he</p>
<p class="p1">said—</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Heaven protect and speed you, lady. Farewell—and sometimes remember</p>
<p class="p1">me.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“I will remember and pray for General Ross while I live,” said</p>
<p class="p1">Catherine. And then she put whip to her horse, and rode away, upheld by</p>
<p class="p1">a wonderful energy.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>

<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Incalculable is the power of the spirit over the flesh. In the intense</p>
<p class="p1">absorption of her soul by one hope, Catherine was carried above all</p>
<p class="p1">consciousness of the excessive exertion, and all sense of the extreme</p>
<p class="p1">fatigue that was oppressing and harassing her bodily powers almost to</p>
<p class="p1">dissolution. But a watchful Providence, that had already thrice arrested</p>
<p class="p1">her dreadful journey, now a fourth time interposed to compel her to</p>
<p class="p1">rest. She had parted with her escort, when past the British outposts,</p>
<p class="p1">beyond Bladensburg. And by the time she had reached Long Old Fields, the</p>
<p class="p1">storm, that had been threatening all the evening, burst suddenly, with</p>
<p class="p1">terrible violence, driving her for shelter into a farm-house. And again,</p>
<p class="p1">wondering and compassionate hosts persuaded her to lie down and repose,</p>
<p class="p1">and once more, as soon as her weary head dropped upon the pillow, deep</p>
<p class="p1">sleep, like an irresistible mandate of the All-Merciful, fell upon her,</p>
<p class="p1">and, despite of pain of body and anguish of mind, she slept soundly for</p>
<p class="p1">several hours;—slept, as the prisoner sleeps the night before</p>
<p class="p1">execution;—slept, as the martyr sleeps in the intervals of torture upon</p>
<p class="p1">the rack;—slept, while the tempest raged with awful fury;—while the rain</p>
<p class="p1">fell in torrents, and the wind rushed through the forest, carrying</p>
<p class="p1">destruction on its wings; while gigantic trees were twisted off, or torn</p>
<p class="p1">up by the roots, and great rivers were swelled to floods;—she slept the</p>
<p class="p1">deep, dreamless sleep “God giveth His beloved.” Probably to this</p>
<p class="p1">Providential sleep she owed the preservation of her life, for the spirit</p>
<p class="p1">that can goad the flesh to exertion unto death, cannot save it from</p>
<p class="p1">dissolution.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">When she awoke, the storm had passed, and the stars were shining dimly</p>
<p class="p1">in the early dawn of day. She started up, remorseful and affrighted to</p>
<p class="p1">find she had slept so long, and to recollect that her journey was not</p>
<p class="p1">half over. It was now four o’clock, and she had yet nearly thirty miles</p>
<p class="p1">to ride before eight, or all was lost! Her pitying hosts tried to</p>
<p class="p1">persuade her to wait and partake of their early breakfast, which, they</p>
<p class="p1">said, would be ready in half an hour; but finding her bent upon setting</p>
<p class="p1">forward, they hastily got some refreshment together, and permitted her</p>
<p class="p1">to mount her horse and depart. But she had not proceeded many yards,</p>
<p class="p1">before she found that the motion of her steed gave her great pain—pain</p>
<p class="p1">so sharp, as to force itself to be felt through all her intense mental</p>
<p class="p1">abstraction. She checked her horse’s trot, and put him into a gallop,</p>
<p class="p1">whose smooth, wavy motion, somewhat relieved her distress.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">The morning was sparklingly brilliant after the storm: the forest trees</p>
<p class="p1">and the grass were spangled by the rain-drops, and the slanting rays of</p>
<p class="p1">the rising run striking deep into the foliage, flecked all its green</p>
<p class="p1">leaves with golden light. Her horse was fresh, his blood was up, and on</p>
<p class="p1">they sped like an arrow through the woods.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Suddenly she stopped and reeled backwards—that sharp pain again; it</p>
<p class="p1">pierced her side and chest like a sword; it caught away her breath, and</p>
<p class="p1">caused the drops of perspiration to burst from her pale forehead. But</p>
<p class="p1">not for pain, or even for the fear of death, must she pause. She might</p>
<p class="p1">perish, but her purpose must first be accomplished, if possible.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Bracing her nerves, and steeling her soul against the sense of</p>
<p class="p1">suffering, she put whip to her horse, and flew on, as before the wind,</p>
<p class="p1">leaving forest, meadow and hamlet—farm-house, field and flood, far</p>
<p class="p1">behind her. Again and again the sharp agony arrested her, like the hand</p>
<p class="p1">of death—but in vain to stop her progress—each time the pang could only</p>
<p class="p1">delay her a moment, and then on and on she sped, spurning the ground</p>
<p class="p1">away in her desperate flight.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Before her, in the distance, glimmered the blue Patuxent, the longed-for</p>
<p class="p1">goal. Oh! that river; for an hour past it had seemed as near as now.</p>
<p class="p1">Would she ever approach it? On and on she sped, while woods and towns</p>
<p class="p1">and plains whirled behind her in a mad reel. A fearful change was coming</p>
<p class="p1">over her. The sense of pain, with all other sense, had gradually left</p>
<p class="p1">her. A stupor of weariness supervened; her brain reeled, her sight</p>
<p class="p1">failed. Oh! that river, how it gleamed and disappeared, and gleamed</p>
<p class="p1">again before her. Would she ever, ever be nearer to it? How dim the</p>
<p class="p1">sunlight was, and how unsteady the ground; and the boundaries of the sky</p>
<p class="p1">and earth were molten together and lost; and it was no longer the action</p>
<p class="p1">of her horse, but the dreadful rocking and upheaving of the ground, that</p>
<p class="p1">kept her moving, moving, moving, forever. Oh! that river! how it</p>
<p class="p1">glimmered and sparkled, and sparkled and flashed into her brain. Would</p>
<p class="p1">she ever, ever, ever reach it, or was she going round in a circle</p>
<p class="p1">forever? Reason was failing at last—past, present and future—things that</p>
<p class="p1">were, and things that seemed, swam thickly together upon brain and</p>
<p class="p1">heart; surely the hour of dissolution had come, for dense darkness and</p>
<p class="p1">heaviness were settling like grave clods upon brain and heart. Oh! God,</p>
<p class="p1">that river!—had she really reached it at last, or was it an illusion of</p>
<p class="p1">delirium? Its waves rolled and flashed in silvery splendor at the foot</p>
<p class="p1">of the hill, below her feet! But what was that? Angels in Heaven! what</p>
<p class="p1">was that? A sight to call back ebbing life! Down in the dell, the</p>
<p class="p1">glitter of bayonets and the glow of scarlet coats—an open square of</p>
<p class="p1">British infantry, enclosing an execution scene! Clutching the pardon</p>
<p class="p1">from her bosom, and holding it aloft at arm’s length, she roused her</p>
<p class="p1">fast failing strength for a last effort, and hurled herself and steed</p>
<p class="p1">furiously down the hill upon the scene of doom. The flash of steel</p>
<p class="p1">around her—the gallows tree—the cart—the prisoner—the fatal noose—and</p>
<p class="p1">more than all, close beside her, the form of him—her own—her</p>
<p class="p1">Clifton—madly loved in life and death, and then—darkness closed in upon</p>
<p class="p1">her life, and all was lost.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">As the reins fell from powerless hands upon the horse’s neck, the noble</p>
<p class="p1">animal stood stock still; had he lifted a leg, it must have been fatal</p>
<p class="p1">to the swooning rider; but he stood like a statue, while her form swayed</p>
<p class="p1">to and fro for a moment, and then Archer Clifton sprang forward and</p>
<p class="p1">received her in his arms. He picked up the paper as it fell from her</p>
<p class="p1">stiffening fingers, and guessing its purport, passed it to the officer</p>
<p class="p1">in command. Then he sank upon one knee, drew her insensible form to and</p>
<p class="p1">supported it against his breast, while he untied her hat and loosened</p>
<p class="p1">her spencer.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">A little bustle ensued around him; but he did not heed it, bending over</p>
<p class="p1">Catherine. The execution was stayed, the prisoner released and poor</p>
<p class="p1">Jack, half-dead with terror before and half mad with joy now, had still</p>
<p class="p1">strength and sense and affection enough left to run to a spring hard by,</p>
<p class="p1">and dip up his hat full of water, and the next instant he was kneeling</p>
<p class="p1">with it by the side of his mistress, to bathe her hands.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Who is she?” “Where did she come from?” “What is her name?” “Who _is_</p>
<p class="p1">the lady?” “Do you know her, sir?” asked some of the officers, crowding</p>
<p class="p1">around with offers of assistance.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“This lady is my wife, gentlemen! Air! air, if you please!” exclaimed</p>
<p class="p1">Archer Clifton, waving them off, and giving his sole attention to</p>
<p class="p1">Catherine. “Kate!”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">The sound of that thrilling voice—the clasp of those thrilling arms, had</p>
<p class="p1">power to call back her spirit from the confines of the invisible world.</p>
<p class="p1">Her pale, pale eyelids quivered.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Kate!” he exclaimed again, raising her higher upon his breast.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">A shuddering sigh convulsed her bosom—her languid eyes unclosed.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Kate!”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Yes, Kate!” she echoed, nodding her head with that quick, nervous,</p>
<p class="p1">spasmodic gesture common to her.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“And why have you done this thing? Why have you placed yourself _en</p>
<p class="p1">scene_ like a third-rate opera dancer?”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">She raised her fading eyes to his face, pleadingly, murmuring—</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Your wishes—the reprieve!”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Well, what of that? Was there no one to bring it but yourself?”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Too feeble to enter upon the long explanation required, she only shook</p>
<p class="p1">her head, murmuring at intervals—</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Forgive—forgive—I could not see him die. Patience, patience—indeed, I</p>
<p class="p1">will not trouble you, love,—I will go away again, far away! Maybe God</p>
<p class="p1">will let me die!”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">The last words were breathed forth in a long, deep sigh, and she sank</p>
<p class="p1">away again into insensibility.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Poor Jack, kneeling by her side, bathed her hand with the water he had</p>
<p class="p1">brought, and with his tears that fell like rain.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Major Clifton laid her head down upon the green sward, and rising to his</p>
<p class="p1">feet, addressed the officer in command, saying—</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Sir, I am a prisoner of war, as you know. Yet, my wife is in a dying</p>
<p class="p1">state here, and I wish to convey her to a place of safety and repose.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Major Clifton will consider himself on his parole, and command any</p>
<p class="p1">assistance we may be able to render him or his heroic wife,” said</p>
<p class="p1">Captain ——, at the same time showing him a note from General Ross to</p>
<p class="p1">that effect, which had been folded in with the pardon.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“I think, sir,” added the officer, “that there is a farm-house near</p>
<p class="p1">here, belonging to a planter of the name of Greenfield, where your lady</p>
<p class="p1">would be hospitably received, and well taken care of; perhaps you had</p>
<p class="p1">better send your servant thither to borrow a carriage.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Thanking the officer for his civility and good advice, Major Clifton</p>
<p class="p1">immediately acted upon it by dispatching Jack to the house, while he</p>
<p class="p1">himself supported Catherine until the arrival of the carriage. He then</p>
<p class="p1">placed her in it, and she was driven slowly to “Greenwood.” Here she was</p>
<p class="p1">kindly received by the planter’s wife and sisters, who tenderly</p>
<p class="p1">undressed her and put her to bed. A physician was summoned, who, when he</p>
<p class="p1">arrived and looked at her and felt her pulse, and heard the</p>
<p class="p1">circumstances, pronounced her insensibility to be not a swoon, but a</p>
<p class="p1">trance-coma—the result of excessive fatigue of mind and body. He said</p>
<p class="p1">that such stupors, if prematurely broken, might end in convulsions and</p>
<p class="p1">madness—or if left, too, to themselves, might terminate in death; that</p>
<p class="p1">her state was exceedingly critical, and that her rest was by no means to</p>
<p class="p1">be broken, unless there was a perceptible failure in her pulse, in which</p>
<p class="p1">case the stimulants and restorative he should leave must be applied and</p>
<p class="p1">administered, and himself instantly summoned. And so he left her.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Having seen Catherine thus at rest, and having received many assurances</p>
<p class="p1">from her gentle-hearted hostess that every care and attention should be</p>
<p class="p1">given her, Major Clifton took leave, and returned to render himself up</p>
<p class="p1">to his captors, who were just about to return to their ship. He went</p>
<p class="p1">with them. And when they had arrived on board the Albion, an agreeable</p>
<p class="p1">surprise awaited him. A gentleman in the uniform of an American general</p>
<p class="p1">stood upon the deck, attended by a flag of truce, and Major Clifton</p>
<p class="p1">immediately recognized Colonel (now General) Conyers, who instantly</p>
<p class="p1">advanced to meet him, and shaking hands heartily, exclaimed—</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“You did not expect to find me here? I have come concerning the</p>
<p class="p1">arrangement of a change of prisoners. Colonel Lithgow of his Britannic</p>
<p class="p1">Majesty’s —— Regiment and taken prisoner by our people in the same</p>
<p class="p1">engagement in which _you_ fell into the hands of the enemy, is now</p>
<p class="p1">offered in exchange for yourself.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Yes, sir,” said Captain ——, advancing towards them, “and I am</p>
<p class="p1">exceedingly happy to say that an exchange has been effected, and to</p>
<p class="p1">congratulate you on your restoration to liberty.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Major Clifton bowed deeply, and requested the use of a boat to leave the</p>
<p class="p1">ship.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Nay—yourself and General Conyers will stay and dine with us?” asked</p>
<p class="p1">Captain ——.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">But Major Clifton, thanking him for his invitation, and also for much</p>
<p class="p1">kindness and attention received during his sojourn as a captive among</p>
<p class="p1">them, declined remaining longer, and repeated his request for a boat.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Oh, _mine_ is here at your service. _I_ am going ashore with you of</p>
<p class="p1">course,” said General Conyers.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“I beg your pardon, sir! the boat you came in has been taken by Captain</p>
<p class="p1">Fairfax, who has gone ashore with it.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Ah, true!”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“_Captain Fairfax?_” asked Archer Clifton.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Yes, my friend, Captain Fairfax. Frank accompanied me hither in search</p>
<p class="p1">of _yourself_. Some news of vital importance he had to communicate,</p>
<p class="p1">which he did not impart to me. He could not wait for your return at all,</p>
<p class="p1">so he went ashore in search of you. He would have found you sooner if he</p>
<p class="p1">had waited here, which proves the truth of the old proverb—“Most haste,</p>
<p class="p1">least speed.””</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“The boat is manned, sir,” said a lieutenant to Major Clifton.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">General Conyers and himself then took leave of the British officers,</p>
<p class="p1">entered the boat, and were rowed swiftly to the land. As soon as they</p>
<p class="p1">had stepped upon the beach, and found themselves alone, Conyers grasped</p>
<p class="p1">the hand of Clifton, and shaking it cordially, said—</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“So, you have won noble Catherine? Well, I congratulate you with a whole</p>
<p class="p1">heart, though you have won her from my hopes.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Won her from your hopes?”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Ay, Archer, I loved her.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Loved her?”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Yes, and love her!”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Love her?”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Yes, and shall _always_ love her, highly and purely though, as a saint</p>
<p class="p1">loves an angel.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“You astonish me!”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“And I shall astonish you more, perhaps. Three several times in one year</p>
<p class="p1">I wooed her, and three several times was my suit rejected by her.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“I say you astound me! Your suit rejected by Catherine! _Yours?_ Can</p>
<p class="p1">this be possible?”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Possible as that I was nearly driven to despair by her rejection.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Major Clifton threw his hand to his brow and gazed at the speaker in</p>
<p class="p1">amazement, while he compared the claims of General Conyers with his own.</p>
<p class="p1">General Conyers, with his haughty and powerful connection in town and</p>
<p class="p1">country; his immense unincumbered estates; his high military rank; and</p>
<p class="p1">last, not least, his eminently handsome person, accomplished mind, and</p>
<p class="p1">graceful address;—General Conyers, in every social, official, and</p>
<p class="p1">personal dignity, highly superior. And himself, with his limited circle;</p>
<p class="p1">his debt-encumbered property; his medium post in the army; and his very</p>
<p class="p1">moderate share of personal attraction, and he exclaimed again—</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Catherine reject _you_?”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Three distinct times, most firmly.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Why, upon what possible pretext could she have done so?”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Ay, sure enough! Upon what possible pretext?” smiled General Conyers,</p>
<p class="p1">ruefully. “Upon the plea that she did not love me, save only ‘as a</p>
<p class="p1">sister or a spirit might.’ I won her respect, esteem, friendship, all</p>
<p class="p1">but her love! She was a frank, high-minded, pure hearted girl. She gave</p>
<p class="p1">me the greatest proof of confidence she could possibly give, and at the</p>
<p class="p1">same instant struck the only death-blow to dangerous hopes that she</p>
<p class="p1">could possibly strike, she told me that she could never be more than a</p>
<p class="p1">faithful friend to me, for that she loved another.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Major Clifton started, and grasped the arm of his companion, but</p>
<p class="p1">instantly recovering his self-control, he inquired, in a calm voice—</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“And who did she say was that other?”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Nay, she never breathed his name. She could not have done that. She was</p>
<p class="p1">trying to do me good when she informed me. I remember well her sweet and</p>
<p class="p1">holy looks and words. At first she flushed and paled, hesitating between</p>
<p class="p1">generous impulse and womanly reserve; and then as principle rose above</p>
<p class="p1">instinct, her face glowed with an expression such as I have seen in the</p>
<p class="p1">pictures of St. Agnes;—a warm, high, holy look, an inspired look, such</p>
<p class="p1">as might well become the countenance of the Virgin Martyr, and she said,</p>
<p class="p1">speaking to herself, ‘There is no good reason why I should not reveal</p>
<p class="p1">any secret of my heart, if the revelation can help any other soul to</p>
<p class="p1">tranquillity and strength.’ Then to me—‘Listen: You are not the only</p>
<p class="p1">sorely disappointed one. Who, indeed, is joyous that is past childhood?</p>
<p class="p1">I, too, have missed life’s crowning joy—the love of one I love. But what</p>
<p class="p1">then? If we cannot have joy in this life of probation, there yet remains</p>
<p class="p1">duty, and the peace its performance yields; and friends, and the</p>
<p class="p1">cheerfulness their society gives; and God, and the divine comfort His</p>
<p class="p1">service brings.’”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“She said that? She said that?” groaned Clifton.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Yes. You seem strongly moved, Archer?”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“I am! I am! You do not know with how much reason! But go on! Tell me</p>
<p class="p1">more of her.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“She never breathed the name of him she loved to my ear, yet I knew her</p>
<p class="p1">whole secret. I had suspected it months before. Shall I tell you why?”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Yes! Go on!”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“It was at the Governor’s levee, where I was first introduced to her,</p>
<p class="p1">and where you met after a long absence; I was present at the casual</p>
<p class="p1">meeting. I beheld the strong emotion that she could not conceal. Some</p>
<p class="p1">hours after that I was near her, when unobserved by all except myself,</p>
<p class="p1">and unconscious of my presence also, she chanced to witness the</p>
<p class="p1">reconciliation between yourself and your chosen bride. I saw her face</p>
<p class="p1">grow paler than death, and then the meek head bow in submission, and the</p>
<p class="p1">meek hands fold as in prayer, and the meek voice murmur low and</p>
<p class="p1">fervently, ‘Thank God! Oh! God help me to say that sincerely.’ I had</p>
<p class="p1">been interested in her before; but I saw that, and I loved her from that</p>
<p class="p1">hour, the sweet, the lovely, the Madonna-like maiden! I loved her with</p>
<p class="p1">an affection as free from passion as it was from selfishness, and as</p>
<p class="p1">free from both as her own pure, saintly nature. And I offered her my</p>
<p class="p1">heart and hand, as I said. And she sweetly and gratefully declined them,</p>
<p class="p1">as I might have known before;—unveiling the sanctuary of her priceless</p>
<p class="p1">heart, to quiet me forever with the revelation of another master there.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Oh, God! Oh, God!” said Clifton.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“What disturbs you so, Archer?”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Never mind. Never mind! And so, rejecting you as a lover, she won you</p>
<p class="p1">as a friend?”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“For life and death and eternity. Yes.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“That was a triumph! Rejected lovers seldom become friends! That was a</p>
<p class="p1">rare triumph! But then Catherine is a rare woman.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Very rare!”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Truly nick-named ‘Maria Theresa.’”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Catherine! ‘Maria Theresa?’ By whom? By some one, I suppose, who,</p>
<p class="p1">recognizing her strong, practical mind, sees nothing better in her</p>
<p class="p1">nature—sees not the pure heart and the lofty spirit of infinitely higher</p>
<p class="p1">value than that.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Heaven bless you, Conyers, for your good opinion of Catherine. But I</p>
<p class="p1">wish to put a case to you, only an imaginary case, you observe,</p>
<p class="p1">Conyers?”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Yes! Well?”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Suppose you had married Catherine?”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“That is very imaginary! Well?”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“And suppose that you had discovered her to be unworthy of your good</p>
<p class="p1">opinion?”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Impossible! It could not have happened, because she could not have been</p>
<p class="p1">unworthy.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“But suppose that her unworthiness had been made manifest to you beyond</p>
<p class="p1">all chance of mistake or doubt?”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“D—n it! Don’t let me be profane. It _couldn’t_ have been made manifest</p>
<p class="p1">to me, I tell you! Could any person or anything demonstrate to me that</p>
<p class="p1">the sun darkened the earth, or the clouds dropped powdered charcoal, or</p>
<p class="p1">that fig trees bore thorns? There are some things that can’t be proved,</p>
<p class="p1">because they can’t exist!”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Major Clifton thrust his hand in his bosom, and drew thence a letter in</p>
<p class="p1">a gray envelope, and handing it to General Conyers, asked—</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Do you know that hand-writing?”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Certainly, I do.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Whose is it?”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Mrs. Catherine Clifton’s.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Are you sure?”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Pooh! Of course I am! I am familiar with the writing!”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Could you swear to it?”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“You are very emphatic in this matter! Let me see the letter again. Yes,</p>
<p class="p1">I could swear to it.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“And now will you do me the favor to read it?”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">General Conyers, with some hesitation, began to read, but before getting</p>
<p class="p1">half through, the blood rushed to his brow, and crushing the letter in</p>
<p class="p1">his hand, he hurled it beneath his feet, and setting his heel upon it,</p>
<p class="p1">ground it into the earth.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“What do you think of it, now?” asked Clifton, bitterly.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Think of it!—it is an infernal forgery! If any man had brought me that</p>
<p class="p1">letter, and said that Catherine wrote it, I should have treated it just</p>
<p class="p1">as I have done now, to show my contempt for the forgery; and then I</p>
<p class="p1">should have raised it with my sword’s point, and thrust it down his</p>
<p class="p1">throat, to express my loathing of the forger or the accomplice.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“And yet, just now you could have sworn to the hand-writing.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Death! Yes! And for which presumption I earnestly beg your pardon,</p>
<p class="p1">Clifton!”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“And now you are quite as much convinced that she did not write it. How</p>
<p class="p1">can you explain this?”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Why, simply thus—that the whole of Catherine’s noble life is a</p>
<p class="p1">refutation of the slander contained in that letter. Sir, it is a d—d</p>
<p class="p1">forgery! Look at it! See how easy the hand is imitated! Give me a pen</p>
<p class="p1">and ink, and though I have not much talent for imitation, I will produce</p>
<p class="p1">you a fac simile of Catherine’s hand-writing. I repeat, I beg your</p>
<p class="p1">forgiveness for saying that that was Catherine’s. I said so, because it</p>
<p class="p1">strongly resembled hers, and I did not know the vile purport! Oh, I</p>
<p class="p1">trust, Clifton, that you signally punished the conspirator who wrote it!</p>
<p class="p1">I can well believe that you neither eat, slept, said your prayers, went</p>
<p class="p1">to church or into her presence, until you had pursued the forger, and</p>
<p class="p1">punished him or her to the utmost extent of the law!”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">They had now arrived at Greenwood, and Major Clifton, without replying,</p>
<p class="p1">conducted his companion into the house, and introduced him to the</p>
<p class="p1">planter’s family. On inquiry concerning the state of Catherine, he</p>
<p class="p1">learned that she still lay without any sign of life, except the faint</p>
<p class="p1">beating of her heart. Leaving General Conyers with his host, he went up</p>
<p class="p1">into his wife’s chamber. He wished to be alone with her. There is</p>
<p class="p1">something in a sound faith that always makes a strong impression. The</p>
<p class="p1">deep, thorough earnestness of confidence in Catherine’s perfect</p>
<p class="p1">integrity, exhibited by Conyers, had shaken Clifton’s firm convictions</p>
<p class="p1">of her guilt to their uprootings, as the whirlwind shakes the oak. Ay,</p>
<p class="p1">and _he_ was shaken—literally shaken, terribly shaken, by strong</p>
<p class="p1">passion, as he exclaimed to himself—</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Oh, would to Heaven I could think as he does! I am no longer a youth,</p>
<p class="p1">credulous of happiness, but if I could only thoroughly believe in Kate</p>
<p class="p1">as he does—or once see her innocence proved, it would fill my heart with</p>
<p class="p1">joy.” He entered the chamber, and went up to her bedside. There was a</p>
<p class="p1">pallor spread like death over her brow. “But she was always so pale,” he</p>
<p class="p1">said, in a voice tremulous with tenderness. So still she lay, so</p>
<p class="p1">profound was her repose, that her breathing could not be seen or heard,</p>
<p class="p1">until, alarmed, he stooped and listened, and perceived that her</p>
<p class="p1">respiration was deep, soft, slow and regular. Her sleep was evidently</p>
<p class="p1">necessary, healthful and recuperative. He stood and gazed at her</p>
<p class="p1">sculptured, marble-like face, as her head reposed upon the pillow. He</p>
<p class="p1">had never seen that noble countenance in the deep repose of sleep</p>
<p class="p1">before. No, and waking, it had always been disturbed by care, or grief,</p>
<p class="p1">or anxiety, or bashfulness. Now the noble face was in perfect rest. The</p>
<p class="p1">majesty of truth sat enthroned upon the fine, broad, open forehead, with</p>
<p class="p1">its eyebrows arched far apart, and more elevated, because the eyelids</p>
<p class="p1">were shut down, with their dark lashes lying long and still upon the</p>
<p class="p1">pale cheeks. And the beauty of goodness lay folded in every curve of the</p>
<p class="p1">lightly-closed and perfect lips. She looked a queen in repose—</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">                 </span>“A Queen of noble Nature’s crowning,”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">whom it were disloyalty to suspect, and treason to accuse. As he gazed,</p>
<p class="p1">the earnest faith of Conyers came back with tenfold power to his soul.</p>
<p class="p1">He more than half abjured his evil convictions, and a flood of</p>
<p class="p1">tenderness came over his heart. There was no one to see his weakness—not</p>
<p class="p1">even _her_—the sleeper. He went and closed the door, and returned and</p>
<p class="p1">kneeled by her side. He took her hand, and bowed his head over it. From</p>
<p class="p1">that trance-sleep there was no fear, because there was no possibility of</p>
<p class="p1">waking her yet. He kissed and pressed that hand with sorrowful</p>
<p class="p1">passion—murmuring—“For once—for this time, I will, _I will_ believe you</p>
<p class="p1">true, my own dear Catherine. My whole nature starves, it starves, and</p>
<p class="p1">withers, and dies for a perfect reconciliation, a perfect union with</p>
<p class="p1">you. Oh, for once, let soul and heart be satisfied—let me steel my mind</p>
<p class="p1">against the thought of evil, and fold you around with my love, and press</p>
<p class="p1">you to this still denied and hungering, perishing heart.” And he raised</p>
<p class="p1">her in his arms, and folded her to his bosom, pressing an ardent kiss</p>
<p class="p1">upon her lips. That passionate kiss sent an electric shock through all</p>
<p class="p1">her still life. A shuddering sigh shook her bosom; her lips parted in a</p>
<p class="p1">light, rosy smile; color dawned upon her cheeks, and light beamed on her</p>
<p class="p1">brow. Alarmed, and remembering the physician’s warning that a premature</p>
<p class="p1">awakening might be fatal, he cautiously laid her down again, and</p>
<p class="p1">anxiously watched her countenance. She did not awake; nor did the light</p>
<p class="p1">depart from her brow; nor the color from her cheeks; nor the smile from</p>
<p class="p1">her lips. “How she loves me. Her soul as well as her person is mine. How</p>
<p class="p1">she loves me, even in sleep—even in this trance-sleep, with all her</p>
<p class="p1">senses locked. How she loves me—my Kate! my own! my wife! How she loves</p>
<p class="p1">me—yet no more than I love her. Witness this worn frame of mine, that</p>
<p class="p1">sorrow, like years, has aged! My own—”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">A light step upon the stairs, and a rap at the door, and he hastened to</p>
<p class="p1">open it. It was the farmer’s little niece, Susannah, who came to say</p>
<p class="p1">that Captain Fairfax was in the parlor, waiting to see Major Clifton. He</p>
<p class="p1">turned back an instant, to arrange the coverlet, gave a last glance at</p>
<p class="p1">the beloved face, and then followed the child down stairs. The staircase</p>
<p class="p1">led directly down into the parlor, and as soon as he had reached it, he</p>
<p class="p1">saw Frank Fairfax, who immediately hastened to meet him, and—</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“My dear Frank!”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“My dearest Clifton!”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Were the words of affectionate greeting interchanged, as they shook</p>
<p class="p1">hands.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Well, and so you have been married these two years nearly, and I have</p>
<p class="p1">never had the opportunity of congratulating you till now! Well, better</p>
<p class="p1">late than never, though it is always a mere form to wish a man joy who</p>
<p class="p1">has an excess of it already! But, indeed, you have the jewel of the</p>
<p class="p1">world! If you had only waited two years longer, until I had somewhat</p>
<p class="p1">recovered the despair of my own awful bereavement, I should have tried</p>
<p class="p1">to dispute the prize with you—not that I was in love with noble</p>
<p class="p1">Catherine—I never was but once in love, and I never shall be again—but</p>
<p class="p1">that I think her just the most precious woman in the world. Nor am I</p>
<p class="p1">alone in that opinion. I have been in her neighborhood, looking for her,</p>
<p class="p1">before I came down here to find you, and there I found that she was</p>
<p class="p1">deeply venerated by her people, and honored, sincerely honored, by all</p>
<p class="p1">the proud, county aristocrats. And General Ross, the gallant General</p>
<p class="p1">Ross, ‘second only to Wellington himself——’ we had to see Admiral</p>
<p class="p1">Cockburn about this exchange of prisoners, and met General Ross in his</p>
<p class="p1">company—I wish you had heard the brave and generous Ross speak of your</p>
<p class="p1">wife. As soon as he knew what we had come for, and recognized your name</p>
<p class="p1">and _hers_, he took Admiral Cockburn aside, and talked with him in the</p>
<p class="p1">most emphatic manner, seeming to insist upon something—(and be it known</p>
<p class="p1">that General Ross exercises a considerable influence over Cockburn, and</p>
<p class="p1">has even restrained him from greater excesses in Washington than were</p>
<p class="p1">committed there, obliging him to spare private dwellings, etc.)—and then</p>
<p class="p1">they came back to where we stood, and the arrangement was effected. And</p>
<p class="p1">to General Ross’s admiration of Catherine’s character, and to his</p>
<p class="p1">generosity, I attribute the ease with which the business was completed.</p>
<p class="p1">‘Sir,’ he said, at parting, ‘had your army at Bladensburg been composed</p>
<p class="p1">of men with spirits equal to that of this heroic woman, your city of</p>
<p class="p1">Washington had not been taken.’ But, where is noble Catherine, now?”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“In a deep sleep, or rather a trance-sleep, superinduced by the</p>
<p class="p1">excessive toil and fatigue she has lately gone through—”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“‘Like a warrior taking his rest!’”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“No—I wish you would not apply that line, great as it is, to _her_. She</p>
<p class="p1">is not heroic, which is masculine—my Kate—she is strong only through her</p>
<p class="p1">affections, and a very child in timidity at other times. But, my dear</p>
<p class="p1">Frank, glad as I am to see you, I wish to know—you have not told me the</p>
<p class="p1">‘business of vital importance,’ which Conyers says, made you his</p>
<p class="p1">companion in seeking me.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">The face of Captain Fairfax suddenly clouded over; he put his hand in</p>
<p class="p1">his bosom, and then hesitating, said—</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“You have seen in the papers the obituary notice of a dear friend?”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“No! Who is it? I have no very dear friend, out of this house, now—whom</p>
<p class="p1">do you mean?”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Mrs. Georgia Clifton is no more.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Major Clifton started back, and gazed at the speaker with an expression</p>
<p class="p1">of deep concern, exclaiming—</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“No! Impossible! How could that be? A woman in such fine health!”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Death is always possible; at all times, and to all persons.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“When, and where, and under what circumstances, did she die? I am very</p>
<p class="p1">sorry.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“She died a week since, at her house, in Richmond.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“I am very sorry. The cause of her death?”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“One of those virulent summer fevers prevalent in the city just at this</p>
<p class="p1">season. Her physicians think that hers was fatally aggravated by the</p>
<p class="p1">life of excitement she had led, and by the friction of something that</p>
<p class="p1">preyed upon her mind.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Frank paused, and Major Clifton kept his eyes fixed with interest upon</p>
<p class="p1">his countenance. Frank sighed, and resumed—</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“A few days before her death, she sent for me. I went, and found her</p>
<p class="p1">laboring under great mental distress. She seemed half disposed to make</p>
<p class="p1">me a confidant; but after much painful hesitation, she reserved her</p>
<p class="p1">secret, whatever it may have been, and drew from beneath her pillow this</p>
<p class="p1">letter, which she gave me—exacting an oath, that after her death, and</p>
<p class="p1">not before—I would hand it to _you_ with the seal unbroken. She said</p>
<p class="p1">that the whole future happiness of yourself and your wife, was concerned</p>
<p class="p1">in your receiving it. And then, with many sighs and groans—for her eyes</p>
<p class="p1">seemed too dry for tears—she let me depart. I never saw her again. A few</p>
<p class="p1">days after that, I heard she was dead.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“The letter?”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Here it is. You seem very much agitated, Clifton!”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“With reason! Give it me!”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">And receiving the letter, Major Clifton hastened to the opposite end of</p>
<p class="p1">the room and began to read it. It was the confession of a guilty and</p>
<p class="p1">dying woman. She wrote, that on the borders of eternity there was no</p>
<p class="p1">false seeming, and no false shame—that all human feelings were lost in</p>
<p class="p1">remorse, in terror, and in awe. Then she confessed her mad and guilty</p>
<p class="p1">passion for himself, and all the crimes into which it had tempted her;</p>
<p class="p1">the slanders that had separated him and his cousin Carolyn—the forged</p>
<p class="p1">letter that had brought such bitter sorrow to himself and Catherine. All</p>
<p class="p1">was confessed and deplored. Finally she supplicated his forgiveness, as</p>
<p class="p1">_he_ hoped to be forgiven of God.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">The subtle self-love of a man can pardon much in a woman whose motive of</p>
<p class="p1">action is a strong passion for himself. Great as her wickedness had</p>
<p class="p1">been—great as the suffering it had caused him, he bore no malice to the</p>
<p class="p1">dead Georgia. He even after a time resolved to cover her sin from all</p>
<p class="p1">eyes—to bury it in the grave with her. But merciful as he was in judging</p>
<p class="p1">Georgia—he was stern enough in condemning himself for so readily</p>
<p class="p1">believing his innocent wife to be guilty. And he divided his broken</p>
<p class="p1">exclamations between severe self-upbraidings, and rejoicings at her full</p>
<p class="p1">acquittal—Frank watching him with curiosity and strong interest.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Oh! fool! fool! fool!”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“What is it, Clifton? Who’s a fool?”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Oh! fool! thrice sodden fool that I’ve been! Thank Heaven. Oh! thank</p>
<p class="p1">Heaven!”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Thank Heaven that he’s a thrice sodden fool! That’s new cause for</p>
<p class="p1">thanksgiving! What’s it all about, Archer?”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Oh! folly! blindness! madness! Heaven be praised! Oh! Heaven be</p>
<p class="p1">praised!”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Heaven be praised for folly, blindness, and madness! Well, Heaven be</p>
<p class="p1">praised for all things! But what the deuce is it, Clifton?”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Mole! mole! Oh, God, how grateful—how rejoiced I am!”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Oh, Lord, how grateful and rejoiced he is, that he’s a mole!</p>
<p class="p1">Clifton!—What the mischief! Don’t keep on striding about, talking to</p>
<p class="p1">yourself, with your hand clapped to your forehead, like a walking</p>
<p class="p1">gentleman in a melo-drama, which you always detested! Besides, you know</p>
<p class="p1">there is no legitimate dramatic reason for a married hero to stride</p>
<p class="p1">about and obstreperate, excepting only jealousy, and you’re not jealous?</p>
<p class="p1">Come! cease starting and vociferating, and tell me the cause—‘the CAUSE,</p>
<p class="p1">my soul!’”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Frank! I’ve been a fool!”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“That’s no news.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“And a brute!”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Who doesn’t know that?”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“And a cursed villain.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Nay, ‘I wouldn’t hear your enemy say that.’”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Oh! Frank, Frank, what shall I do?”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“I am sure I don’t know, unless you tell me the premises of action.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“I cannot, Frank! Dear Frank, I cannot. The memory of the dead should be</p>
<p class="p1">sacred; so should the differences of——I cannot tell you, Frank.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Hist! Here’s the doctor.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Old Doctor Shaw at this moment passed through the parlor, on his way to</p>
<p class="p1">visit his patient.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Major Clifton accompanied him up stairs to her chamber.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">When they reached her bed-chamber, he noticed that the smile had</p>
<p class="p1">departed from her lips, and the color from her cheeks. The old physician</p>
<p class="p1">put on his spectacles, and looked scrutinizingly at her face and hands,</p>
<p class="p1">laid his hand upon her forehead and bosom, to get the temperature, felt</p>
<p class="p1">her pulse, felt her hands and feet, and finally pronounced her to be</p>
<p class="p1">doing very well.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“May she not be wakened up, sir?” asked Clifton, almost selfish in his</p>
<p class="p1">impatience for a reconciliation.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“By no means. She must be let alone—nature is her best physician, and</p>
<p class="p1">the sleep she prescribes, her best medicine.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“But, sir, I have something of vital importance to communicate to her!”</p>
<p class="p1">persisted Clifton.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Sir, it may be of vital importance to _you_, but it would be of fatal</p>
<p class="p1">importance to _her_, should you rouse her to communicate it, whatever it</p>
<p class="p1">is.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Major Clifton was obliged to restrain his eagerness. The physician</p>
<p class="p1">departed, leaving only one simple direction:—that as soon as she awoke</p>
<p class="p1">she should be put in a warm bath.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Archer Clifton was then summoned down stairs to join the family at</p>
<p class="p1">supper. There he found a lively, witty, eccentric personage, who was</p>
<p class="p1">introduced to him as “Our neighbor, Mr. Perry.” And when the evening was</p>
<p class="p1">over, this gentleman took an opportunity of drawing the officers aside,</p>
<p class="p1">and confidentially informing them that the ladies of Greenwood were very</p>
<p class="p1">much crowded with the company of some relations that were staying with</p>
<p class="p1">them just then, and that although they would certainly press their</p>
<p class="p1">guests to remain all night, the latter could not do so without putting</p>
<p class="p1">their kind hostess to much inconvenience; he concluded by offering, and</p>
<p class="p1">heartily pressing upon the gentlemen the accommodations of his own</p>
<p class="p1">house. Thanking Mr. Perry for his kindness, they accepted his proffered</p>
<p class="p1">hospitality, and prepared to accompany him home.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Major Clifton went up stairs, intending only to press a parting kiss</p>
<p class="p1">upon the lips of his now doubly beloved Catherine, but when he reached</p>
<p class="p1">her chamber, he seemed to forget every thing but her, and sat down by</p>
<p class="p1">her bedside, watching the sweet, pale, majestic countenance in its</p>
<p class="p1">death-like repose.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Ay! gaze on, Archer Clifton, for when you have once turned your eyes</p>
<p class="p1">away, sharp heart-pangs must be yours ere you look upon that sculptured</p>
<p class="p1">face again!</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">He remained until summoned by Mr. Perry—then pressing a fond kiss upon</p>
<p class="p1">the calmed lips, he departed with a tacit promise to be at her side</p>
<p class="p1">early in the morning.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">In the morning!</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>

<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">The confidential communication made by Mr. Perry, was probably a ruse on</p>
<p class="p1">the part of that eccentric gentleman, for the purpose of obtaining the</p>
<p class="p1">assistance of the officers in “making a night of it” over at his house.</p>
<p class="p1">Certainly, on reaching the home of their host, they found company</p>
<p class="p1">awaiting their arrival, and they passed the evening in the jolly</p>
<p class="p1">festivity of country hospitality. A luxurious supper was served late at</p>
<p class="p1">night, from which they did not separate until the “small hours.” Thus</p>
<p class="p1">many of the guests overslept themselves the next morning, which delayed</p>
<p class="p1">the family breakfast several hours. Therefore it was after ten o’clock,</p>
<p class="p1">before Major Clifton, very much against the will of his odd entertainer,</p>
<p class="p1">bid him farewell, and set out to return to Greenwood. It was eleven</p>
<p class="p1">o’clock when he reached the farm-house. The ladies were all in their</p>
<p class="p1">sitting-room, engaged in their various domestic occupations of netting,</p>
<p class="p1">sewing, knitting, etc., when he entered, and gave them the morning</p>
<p class="p1">salutation And then—</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“How is Mrs. Clifton this morning, ladies? Can I see her immediately?”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Mrs. Clifton, sir!” said the eldest lady, looking up in surprise. “Mrs.</p>
<p class="p1">Clifton is gone sir. Did you not know it?”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Gone?” repeated Archer Clifton, incredulously.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Yes, sir.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“_Gone!_” he reiterated, in amazement.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Yes, sir. We certainly thought that you were aware of her departure.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Most certainly not! _Gone!_ When? how? excuse me, madam, but where has</p>
<p class="p1">she gone?”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“We do not know, sir, indeed, since you cannot tell us. We thought that</p>
<p class="p1">she had gone to join you, at Mr. Perry’s. We were very sorry, but—”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“How long since she left? How did she go? Pardon my vehemence, dear</p>
<p class="p1">madam.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“We partake of your anxiety, sir. Mrs. Clifton left us about four hours</p>
<p class="p1">since, at seven o’clock, immediately after breakfast. She went away on</p>
<p class="p1">the horse that was brought here yesterday as her own. She left us very</p>
<p class="p1">much against our arguments and persuasions. We would gladly have</p>
<p class="p1">detained her.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Gone! Good Heavens, was she _able_ to go.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“No, sir, assuredly she was not.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Archer Clifton sank into a chair, exclaiming—</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Pray, tell me, dear madam, the circumstances of this departure, and all</p>
<p class="p1">that occurred from the time I left, until she went away.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Why, sir, after you left, she continued in the same deep sleep until</p>
<p class="p1">nearly nine o’clock, when she began to show symptoms of awakening. I</p>
<p class="p1">sent out and ordered the hot bath to be prepared, and sat down to watch</p>
<p class="p1">her. As she drew near to consciousness, her face lost that look of</p>
<p class="p1">profound repose, which had previously marked it, and began to assume an</p>
<p class="p1">expression of suffering. Her brows folded, and her lips sprang apart and</p>
<p class="p1">quivered, as with a spasm of sharp pain, and her eyes flared open</p>
<p class="p1">suddenly, and she was awake. I asked her how she felt, but she shook her</p>
<p class="p1">head, and closed her eyes again, and shut her teeth tightly, like one</p>
<p class="p1">trying to bear silently some sharp, inward pain. The bath was then</p>
<p class="p1">prepared by the bedside, and we began to get her ready for it; but on</p>
<p class="p1">the slightest attempt to move her, she groaned so deeply, that we</p>
<p class="p1">scarcely dared to lift her for some minutes. I knew then how it</p>
<p class="p1">was;—that her muscles were stiff and painful, from the severe exertion</p>
<p class="p1">of such a long equestrian journey. And I knew also that the hot bath</p>
<p class="p1">would relieve her; and the doctor’s directions had been peremptory, so</p>
<p class="p1">we tried again, and placed her in the bath. And very soon the hot water</p>
<p class="p1">seemed to alleviate her sufferings. And when we put her comfortably to</p>
<p class="p1">bed again, she thanked us very sweetly. I asked her how she found</p>
<p class="p1">herself. She answered, ‘Better’—adding, that she thought, by her hard</p>
<p class="p1">exercise, she had hurt some part of her chest or side, which had given</p>
<p class="p1">her great pain, but which was now partially relieved.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Did she seem very much better? Was her voice strong in speaking?”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“No, it was very weak and faint, and frequently broken, as by some</p>
<p class="p1">inward pain, as I said.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Go on, dear lady.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“We brought her a cup of tea and a plate of toast, of both of which she</p>
<p class="p1">partook slightly. It was then after nine o’clock, and she begged that</p>
<p class="p1">she might not disturb us—that we would retire to bed—and said that she</p>
<p class="p1">was better, and would try to sleep again. She then composed herself to</p>
<p class="p1">rest, and the girls all left the room. I remained watching until I</p>
<p class="p1">thought she slept, and then I lay down to rest on the other bed in the</p>
<p class="p1">same room. I think she passed a good night, for I could not divest</p>
<p class="p1">myself of uneasiness upon her account, and so I could not get to sleep</p>
<p class="p1">until after midnight, and during all that time I never heard her move,</p>
<p class="p1">or sigh. After I did get to sleep, however, I slept very soundly, till</p>
<p class="p1">near six o’clock. And when I awoke, what was my surprise, to see her up</p>
<p class="p1">and dressed, as for a journey. She looked very pale and ill and</p>
<p class="p1">sorrowful, and in fastening her habit, she frequently stopped and leaned</p>
<p class="p1">against the bed-post for support. I arose quickly and questioned her</p>
<p class="p1">wishes, and begged her to lie down again. But she only waved her hand</p>
<p class="p1">against me, with a mute, imploring gesture. I expostulated with her, but</p>
<p class="p1">arguments and persuasions were alike in vain—she only answered, ‘I must</p>
<p class="p1">go.’”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Oh, Heaven! Where, where did she wish to go?”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“We do not know. She was not communicative, and we did not like to</p>
<p class="p1">question her.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Forgive me, dear madam. Indeed I fear my questionings must appear</p>
<p class="p1">almost rude, but my great anxiety must be my excuse.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Your anxiety is very natural, sir, and we share it.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Did she know that I was in the neighborhood? Did any one inform her?”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“We cannot tell whether she knew of your presence here. We did not tell</p>
<p class="p1">her, for, as I said, she made no inquiries, and there was a reserve</p>
<p class="p1">about her despair that shut itself in from all interference. Indeed it</p>
<p class="p1">would be scarcely doing justice to her look of deep sorrow, to say that</p>
<p class="p1">she was the most hopeless looking human being I ever saw in my life. She</p>
<p class="p1">seemed like one who had seen her last hope go down.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Merciful God!”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“We used every method, except force, to prevent her leaving us, though</p>
<p class="p1">we were impressed with the idea that she was going to you. And after her</p>
<p class="p1">departure, in consulting together, we were half sorry that we had not</p>
<p class="p1">essayed gentle coercion, for we all suspected that the lady’s reason was</p>
<p class="p1">clouded.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Great God! I have driven her to madness—perhaps to death!” thought</p>
<p class="p1">Archer Clifton, but then he exerted self-control enough to conceal the</p>
<p class="p1">depths and extent of his anxiety, and asked, “What road did she take?”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“The North-west road, sir, which branches off towards Mr. Perry’s a</p>
<p class="p1">quarter of a mile up, which was one of our reasons for supposing that</p>
<p class="p1">she had gone to join you.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Taking a hasty leave of the family, Major Clifton remounted his horse,</p>
<p class="p1">and rode furiously up the road, meeting General Conyers and Frank, who</p>
<p class="p1">had lagged behind on their return home. Stopping them, he communicated</p>
<p class="p1">what had happened, but concealed his worst fears, and merely said that</p>
<p class="p1">he presumed that Catherine had left for her Virginia home, in ignorance</p>
<p class="p1">of his liberation, and his presence in the neighborhood, and that he</p>
<p class="p1">wished, if possible, to overtake her, before she had proceeded far upon</p>
<p class="p1">her road. Frank immediately turned rein to accompany him, while General</p>
<p class="p1">Conyers, with many expressions of regret and concern, took leave of</p>
<p class="p1">them, to return to Greenwood, and explain their absence.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">The road lay for many miles through a dense forest, and they galloped</p>
<p class="p1">onward for hours without meeting a single traveler or seeing a solitary</p>
<p class="p1">house. Near the outskirts of the forest they came upon a party of</p>
<p class="p1">stragglers, whom they judged to be deserters from the British army. But</p>
<p class="p1">these men, when questioned, gave cautious and unsatisfactory</p>
<p class="p1">answers—sulkily insisting that no lady riding alone had passed that way.</p>
<p class="p1">They next inquired of some field laborers, who were stacking grain a</p>
<p class="p1">little farther on. They replied that a lady in a dark riding-dress,</p>
<p class="p1">riding on a bay horse, and a boy, mounted on a white mare, attended her.</p>
<p class="p1">Perhaps this was Catherine, and her attendant some chance passenger.</p>
<p class="p1">They questioned more particularly, and the description given answered to</p>
<p class="p1">her personal appearance. They asked what road she had taken, and being</p>
<p class="p1">told “straight ahead,” they set off in a gallop. A few miles further on</p>
<p class="p1">they again inquired, and were told that such a lady, attended by a boy,</p>
<p class="p1">had passed about an hour before. Full of hope, they put spurs to their</p>
<p class="p1">horses and hurried on, congratulating themselves that they were gaining</p>
<p class="p1">on her so fast.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">At length they reached a school-house in the woods, where, tied to a</p>
<p class="p1">fence, they saw the bay horse, with a side-saddle, and a white pony,</p>
<p class="p1">with a boy’s saddle. Dismounting quickly, Captain Fairfax hastened to</p>
<p class="p1">the school-room door, and inquired of the master to whom the animal</p>
<p class="p1">belonged?</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“To Mrs. Jones, who has just brought her son to school,” answered the</p>
<p class="p1">teacher, full of surprise at the question.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">And there, indeed, sat “Mrs. Jones” and young Hopeful, looking as if</p>
<p class="p1">they considered such investigation into their property very impertinent,</p>
<p class="p1">to say the least.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Disappointed, Frank returned to Major Clifton with this explanation, and</p>
<p class="p1">they looked at each other in chagrin and perplexity—Major Clifton with</p>
<p class="p1">great difficulty maintaining his self-possession, and concealing the</p>
<p class="p1">dreadful forebodings that overshadowed his mind. They were now thirty</p>
<p class="p1">miles from Greenwood, and the sun was getting low.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“I do not see anything better to do, Archer, than to keep on till we</p>
<p class="p1">reach Washington City. No doubt you will see her there, if you do not</p>
<p class="p1">overtake her before.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Again putting whip to their horses, they galloped on, passing the great</p>
<p class="p1">belt of forest, and entering upon the bare lowlands, lying south of the</p>
<p class="p1">city. It was late in the night when they descended the road leading to</p>
<p class="p1">the Anacostic bridge. They found that the bridge had been destroyed, and</p>
<p class="p1">they experienced much difficulty and delay before finding a boat to take</p>
<p class="p1">them across. They entered the ruined and blackened city a little after</p>
<p class="p1">midnight. At that hour little opportunity of search was afforded, and</p>
<p class="p1">that little was fruitless. They had much trouble in finding a night’s</p>
<p class="p1">lodging in the desolate city, but at length obtained indifferent</p>
<p class="p1">shelter, and retired, with the determination to pursue their</p>
<p class="p1">investigations in the morning. At an early hour they arose, and went</p>
<p class="p1">out, making inquiries in every direction, but in vain. No one had seen</p>
<p class="p1">or heard of the missing lady though many cheerfully suggested that she</p>
<p class="p1">had fallen into the hands of the British soldiery, who were on their</p>
<p class="p1">retreat through the low counties. Strongly impressed with the idea that</p>
<p class="p1">she must be in or near Washington, they were unwilling to abandon their</p>
<p class="p1">search, but remained in the city all day, and through the next night,</p>
<p class="p1">before resigning all hope of finding her there. Even upon the second</p>
<p class="p1">morning, Major Clifton and Captain Fairfax were divided in their opinion</p>
<p class="p1">as to whether they had better go back to St. Mary’s, or go on to R——.</p>
<p class="p1">Major Clifton, full of the darkest presentiments, was disposed to turn</p>
<p class="p1">back. Captain Fairfax, on the contrary, full of hope and confidence,</p>
<p class="p1">urged his friend to push forward. While they were debating, General</p>
<p class="p1">Conyers rode up and joined them. He said he had but that morning reached</p>
<p class="p1">the city, and had been an hour in search of them. In answer to their</p>
<p class="p1">anxious questions, General Conyers informed them that up to late the</p>
<p class="p1">night before, no news had been heard of Mrs. Clifton—that she evidently</p>
<p class="p1">was not in the neighborhood he had just left. He seemed grieved and</p>
<p class="p1">alarmed to find that they had not yet overtaken Catherine, but expressed</p>
<p class="p1">a strong conviction that she must be on her way home. He advised them to</p>
<p class="p1">pursue the journey, and regretting that peremptory duty called him to an</p>
<p class="p1">interview with the Secretary of War, and prevented his bearing them</p>
<p class="p1">company, took leave, and rode away—turning back once to beg that as soon</p>
<p class="p1">as they had found Catherine, they would write to him at Washington, and</p>
<p class="p1">let him know. Major Clifton and Frank procured fresh horses, and leaving</p>
<p class="p1">their own, set forward on their anxious journey.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">The gloomiest forebodings darkened the mind of Archer Clifton. There was</p>
<p class="p1">one scene ever present to his mental vision—where, at the end of her</p>
<p class="p1">dreadful journey, fainting from incredible exertion, Catherine had</p>
<p class="p1">fallen into his arms, and he had received her with a harsh and stern</p>
<p class="p1">rebuke for making a scene:—one look and tone of hers, that filled his</p>
<p class="p1">soul with remorse and terror prophetic of doom—her last despairing</p>
<p class="p1">gaze—her last despairing tones, before she sank into insensibility. How</p>
<p class="p1">plaintively they echoed through his heart——“Patience, patience,</p>
<p class="p1">patience——Indeed I will not trouble you, love——I will go away——Maybe God</p>
<p class="p1">will let me die.” Would he ever forget those words, that voice, that</p>
<p class="p1">gaze of unutterable but meek despair!</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“I have broken her heart. I have killed her. I have killed her. Woman’s</p>
<p class="p1">nature could not live through what I have driven _her_ through! _Poor,</p>
<p class="p1">poor girl!_—so bitterly slandered!—so cruelly tortured! Persecuted unto</p>
<p class="p1">death—or worse—unto madness! And where is she now? Perhaps the waves of</p>
<p class="p1">the Patuxent roll over her cold bosom—calmed at last; or perhaps she</p>
<p class="p1">lives—a mad and houseless wanderer; but I will not believe this, I will</p>
<p class="p1">not believe it! She may be dead; she must be broken-hearted, but not</p>
<p class="p1">mad! All-Merciful God!—not mad! She may be dead—and that would be just,</p>
<p class="p1">for it would secure her happiness and my own retribution, in the only</p>
<p class="p1">way that both could be secured, perhaps.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Not a hint of this prophetic despair was breathed to Fairfax. Clifton’s</p>
<p class="p1">indomitable pride, regnant even over this anxiety, forbade the</p>
<p class="p1">communication of his remorse and alarm, and the great reason he had for</p>
<p class="p1">both. Yet Frank observed and tried to cheer his friend’s deep gloom.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Come, rouse yourself, Archer, we are nearing L——, and shall be at White</p>
<p class="p1">Cliffs by night-fall, and who, but Mrs. Clifton will meet us at the</p>
<p class="p1">door, with her gentle smile and gentle welcome, and then shall we not</p>
<p class="p1">all spend a jolly evening, laughing over our cups of tea at the famous</p>
<p class="p1">wild-goose chase we have had?” But little effect had Frank’s words on</p>
<p class="p1">his drooping fellow traveler. Only as they drew near White Cliffs his</p>
<p class="p1">depression rose into feverish excitement. Arrived at L——, they inquired</p>
<p class="p1">if Mrs. Clifton had passed through there, and were informed that she had</p>
<p class="p1">not. It was long after night-fall that they reached White Cliffs. Here</p>
<p class="p1">the terrified house servants, roused up from their sleep, answered to</p>
<p class="p1">all inquiries upon the subject, that they had not seen or heard from</p>
<p class="p1">their mistress since she left to go to Washington. Henny pushed foremost</p>
<p class="p1">of all to inquire about her “dear mist’ess and brother Jack.” But with a</p>
<p class="p1">gesture of desperation, Major Clifton sent her off unsatisfied, and</p>
<p class="p1">turned an agonized look upon Frank. Fairfax was almost discouraged, but,</p>
<p class="p1">nevertheless, he answered that silent appeal hopefully, saying, “Oh!</p>
<p class="p1">doubtless she will be home to-morrow, or the next day, at farthest. We</p>
<p class="p1">ought to have remembered that she had not recovered from her fatigue,</p>
<p class="p1">and that she would probably take her own time in returning. We have</p>
<p class="p1">outridden her, evidently.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Major Clifton rejoined by a groan. He ordered refreshments for his</p>
<p class="p1">guest, and soon after attended him to his room, and retired to his own,</p>
<p class="p1">not to rest, but to walk about distractedly, and then he burst into</p>
<p class="p1">Catherine’s vacant chamber, and threw himself down upon her empty bed,</p>
<p class="p1">in the very anguish of bereavement. His long residence in the lowlands</p>
<p class="p1">of the Chesapeake, during the hot summer months, had pre-disposed him to</p>
<p class="p1">illness. His long journey, under the burning sun of August by day, and</p>
<p class="p1">heavy dews of August by night, fatigue and anxiety, loss of food and</p>
<p class="p1">sleep, all conspired to bring on the pernicious fever, and before</p>
<p class="p1">morning Archer Clifton was tossing and raving in high delirium. Summoned</p>
<p class="p1">by the alarmed servants, Captain Fairfax was early at his bedside, and</p>
<p class="p1">seeing his condition, dispatched a messenger for the family physician.</p>
<p class="p1">For many days, his state alternated between delirium and stupor, and his</p>
<p class="p1">life tottered upon the edge of the grave. And in his delirium all his</p>
<p class="p1">raving was of Catherine—still Catherine—now adjuring her as his</p>
<p class="p1">Nemesis—now wooing her by the most tender epithets of affection—calling</p>
<p class="p1">her his “poor wounded dove,” his “broken-hearted child,” etc. Often, he</p>
<p class="p1">repeated plaintively her last sorrowful, hopeless words.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">At length the crisis of the disease came. The delirium arose to a</p>
<p class="p1">frenzy. His spirit, as well as his flesh, seemed to be passing through</p>
<p class="p1">the very fires of purgatory. He raved incessantly—now of Carolyn, now of</p>
<p class="p1">Georgia, then of his mother, and always of Catherine—sometimes calling</p>
<p class="p1">down the bitterest imprecations upon his own head, sometimes severely</p>
<p class="p1">reproaching Georgia, sometimes pleading his cause with his mother, and</p>
<p class="p1">always breaking off to soothe and coax Catherine, as if she were circled</p>
<p class="p1">in his arm.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">At length the frenzy fairly exhausted itself, and he sank into a</p>
<p class="p1">comatose state, to dream of Catherine, to see visions of Catherine, to</p>
<p class="p1">feel her gentle presence, and healing ministrations all about him. Then</p>
<p class="p1">came insensibility, which lasted he did not know how long, for all sense</p>
<p class="p1">of time and place and existence itself was blotted out.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">And at last he awoke—the burning fever had gone out from his blood, and</p>
<p class="p1">a delicious coolness ran through all his veins—the terrible nervous</p>
<p class="p1">excitement had subsided, and a luxurious calm lay upon mind and body,</p>
<p class="p1">until memory came to disturb it, perhaps to torture it. He was</p>
<p class="p1">experiencing the delightful sensations of restoration and convalescence,</p>
<p class="p1">and his physical state alone would have been a sufficient cause for</p>
<p class="p1">happiness, but for one aching, aching spot, one sharp point of agony as</p>
<p class="p1">it were in his heart’s core. And when the cry in his bosom found its</p>
<p class="p1">corresponding expression, the word was “Catherine!” “Catherine!”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">His eyes had opened on his darkened chamber, where, upon the hearth,</p>
<p class="p1">glimmered a feeble taper, that scarcely sent its weak rays beyond the</p>
<p class="p1">edges of the hearth. He knew it must be near day, for the low, melodious</p>
<p class="p1">detonating sounds of early morning were echoing through the mountains.</p>
<p class="p1">The chamber seemed deserted—not if Catherine had been living would his</p>
<p class="p1">sick bed have been so abandoned, he thought. He turned and groaned from</p>
<p class="p1">the depths of his bosom—“Oh, Catherine! Catherine.” His room was very</p>
<p class="p1">dusky—he could not see the presence by his couch—but now gentler than</p>
<p class="p1">“tired eyelids upon tired eyes” fell a soft hand upon his brow.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Surely there was but one touch like that in the world!</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">A new born, feeble hope was trembling at his heart, a hope that he</p>
<p class="p1">feared to disturb lest it should die in disappointment; that he dared</p>
<p class="p1">scarcely submit to the test of certainty, lest that certainty should</p>
<p class="p1">bring not joy but despair. At last, trembling with doubt, he murmured,</p>
<p class="p1">“Am I dreaming, or, dear Kate, are you here?”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“I am here,” she answered softly.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Darling, are you well?”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Very well—but _you_ are not well enough to talk yet,” said Kate,</p>
<p class="p1">gently.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Dear Kate—how long have you been home?”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Since the day you were taken ill,” replied Kate, at the same time</p>
<p class="p1">encircling his shoulders with one arm, and raising him, while with the</p>
<p class="p1">other hand she placed a glass to his lips.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Whether the medicine were a potent sedative, or whether her gentler</p>
<p class="p1">touch had a soothing effect, or whether both these influences acted upon</p>
<p class="p1">him, I cannot tell; but certainly the nervous excitement, just raised by</p>
<p class="p1">the discovery of her presence, subsided into perfect calmness, and he</p>
<p class="p1">lay with his hand folded in Catherine’s, until he fell asleep.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">When he awoke again it was sunrise, and his room looked cheerful, and</p>
<p class="p1">the family physician and Frank Fairfax stood at his bedside, with their</p>
<p class="p1">congratulations on his convalescence. And while they staid, his eyes</p>
<p class="p1">were roving restlessly around the room, in search of some one else.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">And when they went away, Catherine entered, bringing cold water, and</p>
<p class="p1">came and sponged his head and hands. And then she went out, and returned</p>
<p class="p1">with his light breakfast. She sat upon the bed, supporting his head and</p>
<p class="p1">shoulders upon her bosom while he ate. At last—</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Take it all away, dearest Kate,” he said, “and sit where I can see you.</p>
<p class="p1">It is you who are my restorative.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">When the service was removed, and his pillows were arranged, and he was</p>
<p class="p1">comfortably laid back upon them again, he said—</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Dearest Kate, do you know that I know at last, how deeply you have been</p>
<p class="p1">injured?”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">She stooped down to him saying, softly—</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Please do not try to talk to-day. Yield to the inclination you have for</p>
<p class="p1">sleep. It is so needful to you, and will prove so restorative. And</p>
<p class="p1">to-morrow, when you are better, we can converse.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">He smiled upon her, and laid his hand in hers, and while she clasped it,</p>
<p class="p1">fell asleep.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">With a strong constitution like that of Archer Clifton, the</p>
<p class="p1">convalescence is rapid. And Catherine’s presence, as he said, was his</p>
<p class="p1">true restorative.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">The fourth morning from this, he was very much better, and reclined</p>
<p class="p1">comfortably upon his couch watching Catherine, who moved quietly about</p>
<p class="p1">the room setting things in order. He was much wasted by illness, and his</p>
<p class="p1">face looked still more sallow and haggard for the dark, dishevelled hair</p>
<p class="p1">and whiskers that encircled it; but his countenance wore an expression</p>
<p class="p1">of subdued joy as he lay and watched Kate. At last—</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Are you so much afraid that Henny will disturb me by rattling a cup and</p>
<p class="p1">saucer, or jingling a teaspoon, that you must do all yourself? My</p>
<p class="p1">devoted Kate, I am not so ill. Come and sit upon the lounge by me, and</p>
<p class="p1">let me talk to you,” he said, holding out his arms.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">She went and sat upon the side of the couch, and he encircled her with</p>
<p class="p1">his arm, while he said—</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“My dear Kate, do you know that I thought I had lost you?”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">She raised her eyes in gentle wonder.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Yes, I thought your great and undeserved misfortunes had killed or</p>
<p class="p1">maddened you.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“It was the approach of your illness that gave you such dreadful</p>
<p class="p1">thoughts,” said Catherine, gently.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Not entirely, dear Kate. It was your last words when you fainted on my</p>
<p class="p1">bosom—do you remember them?”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“No—I remember nothing very distinctly from the moment I threw myself in</p>
<p class="p1">among the soldiery, and saw the bayonets glittering around me, until I</p>
<p class="p1">awoke and found myself in the farmer’s house.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Ah! don’t you remember that in answer to my harsh question—harsh Kate,</p>
<p class="p1">because I was still in blindness—you answered—‘Patience, patience,</p>
<p class="p1">patience; indeed I will not trouble you, love—I will go away; maybe God</p>
<p class="p1">will let me die.’”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Did I really use those words?”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Yes, and with such a look of hopeless resignation! I thought that I had</p>
<p class="p1">lost you, Kate. I thought that you were dead or mad, or at least had</p>
<p class="p1">been driven from me, for you said so earnestly, ‘I will go away?.’”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Did I say that? I do not remember. But I suppose I meant that I would</p>
<p class="p1">go home. And, oh! do you think—</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Think what, dear Kate?”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">She paused, and her face flushed. She had been about to say, “Do you</p>
<p class="p1">think that anything but your own will would have driven me from you?”</p>
<p class="p1">But her old shyness returned upon her stronger than ever.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">He understood her, and told her so by the tightening pressure of his</p>
<p class="p1">arm.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“And, dear Kate, we could hear of you nowhere. You were long in</p>
<p class="p1">returning, Catherine.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Yes, when I started I was still very unequal to the return journey, I</p>
<p class="p1">had weakened myself, and was obliged to ride slowly. And then I lost my</p>
<p class="p1">way coming back—that was how you missed me.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“And does my Kate know that I know now how deeply she has been wronged,</p>
<p class="p1">and how nobly she has borne those wrongs—returning always good for evil.</p>
<p class="p1">And can she guess the remorse and sorrow of heart that hurried on this</p>
<p class="p1">fit of illness?” Then suddenly overcome with emotion, he exclaimed: “Oh,</p>
<p class="p1">my God, Catherine! can you imagine how I suffered?”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Yes, yes, indeed I know it all! I learned all—all—in the raving of your</p>
<p class="p1">delirium. Others thought it _mere_ raving but I knew.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“And do you know who forged that fatal letter, Kate?”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Yes.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Who was it, then?”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“You said, Mrs. Georgia.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Yes. It was strange you never suspected that, Kate.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“I did suspect it.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“You did suspect it!” exclaimed Archer Clifton, in surprise.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Yes.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“And you never breathed that suspicion!”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“No, because I had no certain evidence against her. It would have been</p>
<p class="p1">wrong to have acted upon a mere suspicion.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Just and upright in all things!”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“I only believed God’s promises. I left my cause to Heaven.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“And Heaven has vindicated you, my Kate! You have seen my sufferings</p>
<p class="p1">since discovering how unjustly you had been condemned; but, oh, Kate, I</p>
<p class="p1">suffered also when I madly believed you guilty.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“I know you did. I do know you did. It was that that gave point to my</p>
<p class="p1">own sorrow.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“When I cast you into the fire, while you were tortured, _I_ was</p>
<p class="p1">scathed! I loved you too perfectly not to suffer with you. You were too</p>
<p class="p1">really a portion of myself, for me not to suffer through you. I am</p>
<p class="p1">thinking of that Archbishop, Kate—whose name I have forgotten—”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Cranmer?”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Yes, Cranmer! See how our very unspoken thoughts rush together, dear</p>
<p class="p1">wife. Yes, Kate, I was thinking of Cranmer, who thrust his offending</p>
<p class="p1">hand into the flames, and held it there, until it burned to cinders, and</p>
<p class="p1">dropped off. Oh, my Kate! was it his hand alone that suffered, or did</p>
<p class="p1">not his whole body agonize with it? And so, my Catherine, when believing</p>
<p class="p1">you unworthy, I thrust you into the fire, did I not suffer through you</p>
<p class="p1">in all my nature? I did! I did, Catherine! Lift up the hair from my</p>
<p class="p1">temples, and tell me what you see?”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Kate lifted the clustering dark curls, and answered—</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“A few white hairs.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“_The tears I made you shed, bleached them, Kate._”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">She did not reply, except by meeting his gaze with a look of earnest</p>
<p class="p1">affection.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">He resumed—</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Yes—even then, when insanely I believed it possible for you to be</p>
<p class="p1">guilty—even _then_—every look of anguish on your brow wrung my</p>
<p class="p1">bosom—every tear you dropped, fell hot upon my heart. Stoop down. Let me</p>
<p class="p1">tell you one little simple thing—I sometimes saw—oh, I used to watch you</p>
<p class="p1">so closely, because I could not help it, Kate;—when I was harsh and</p>
<p class="p1">stern, I sometimes saw your chin quiver—like a grieved child’s—and,</p>
<p class="p1">Kate, my whole soul would be overflowed with tenderness, which, to</p>
<p class="p1">conceal, I had to start up and leave the room, with every appearance of</p>
<p class="p1">anger that I could falsely assume.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Kate wept—her tears fell fast upon his hand, that she had clasped</p>
<p class="p1">between her own.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“And, oh, Catherine, to think that all this trouble I have suffered, and</p>
<p class="p1">have inflicted upon you, should have been so unnecessary!”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Catherine slid from the edge of the couch down upon her knees beside it,</p>
<p class="p1">and her countenance grew earnest, and inspired with faith and love, as</p>
<p class="p1">she clasped her hands, and said—</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Oh, no! it was _not_ unnecessary. God suffered it to be, and it was</p>
<p class="p1">well—_very_ well! ‘All things work together for good, to them that love</p>
<p class="p1">the Lord.’ And every pang that has ploughed our hearts in the past, will</p>
<p class="p1">make them fruitful of good in the future. One fruit is, that the</p>
<p class="p1">suffering of the last two years has drawn our hearts together as nothing</p>
<p class="p1">else could have done. Because—”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Again in the full tide of her earnest thoughts, the old bashfulness</p>
<p class="p1">flushed her cheek, and silenced her tongue. She wished to say, “Because</p>
<p class="p1">I think you would never have known me so well, or held me so dear, if</p>
<p class="p1">you had not proved me by fiery trial.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">And again his heart rightly interpreted her silence, and he answered her</p>
<p class="p1">unuttered thought by saying—</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Yes, you are right, my own dear blessing! You are right, for I never</p>
<p class="p1">should have known your full value but for the trial you have passed</p>
<p class="p1">through. Yet not now only, but always have I loved you, dear wife. I</p>
<p class="p1">denied it to myself—I denied it to others—but there it was, the perfect,</p>
<p class="p1">vital love, as sure as fate. When I first saw you, Kate, I met in your</p>
<p class="p1">face, your voice, your manner,—yes, in every look and tone and gesture,</p>
<p class="p1">in your whole unity—something that I had vainly sought through</p>
<p class="p1">life—something homogenial to my nature—something perfectly satisfying.</p>
<p class="p1">You seemed, dear Kate, not so much a separate existence as the</p>
<p class="p1">completion of my own. What did you say, Kate? Your voice, too, is ‘ever</p>
<p class="p1">soft, gentle and low,’—but speak again dearest. It is something that my</p>
<p class="p1">heart listens to hear.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“I said that I, too, when we first met,” she hesitated, and her cheek</p>
<p class="p1">crimsoned, but feeling that he listened breathless for her words, she</p>
<p class="p1">continued,—“Well, only this: I felt as if I were wholly yours, Archer—I</p>
<p class="p1">have felt so ever since.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Again she paused from native bashfulness.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Kiss me, Kate,—you never kissed me in your life.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Blushing and timid as the girl that she was, she stooped and lightly</p>
<p class="p1">touched his lips with hers. But laughing fondly he threw his arm around</p>
<p class="p1">her, exclaiming—</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“You child! you child! Married two years and cannot kiss me!” and</p>
<p class="p1">pressed her to his bosom, for one instant, in a passionate embrace, that</p>
<p class="p1">sent life and gladness through all her veins, and then he said, “I am</p>
<p class="p1">not ill, Catherine. I have drawn health from your lips. See who is at</p>
<p class="p1">the door, love.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Kate went and admitted Frank, who came in accoutred for traveling.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Ha! where now, Fairfax?” asked Clifton.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“For Richmond to-day.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“No! You will not leave us so soon?”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Yes,—the truth is, I _must_. I have an engagement to fulfill there on</p>
<p class="p1">Thursday.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“An engagement! Of what nature, Frank, if a friend may ask?”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Why, the fact is,” said Captain Fairfax, growing very red in the face,</p>
<p class="p1">with the effort of pulling on a pair of gloves, “I am going to be</p>
<p class="p1">married.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Married! Oh, Frank! and not to tell us anything about it till now.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Hem! There was no proper opportunity till now,” stammered the young</p>
<p class="p1">man.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Well, who is the lady, Frank?” asked Clifton, while Catherine looked</p>
<p class="p1">and listened with interest.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“The only friend that my dear Zuleime found in all her adversity—Mrs.</p>
<p class="p1">Knight,” said Frank, and then he added, quickly, “It was a long time</p>
<p class="p1">before my mother’s pride could be reconciled to this, but Ida’s genuine</p>
<p class="p1">goodness won her at last.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">After the first involuntary expression of surprise, Catherine and</p>
<p class="p1">Clifton exchanged glances, and Catherine said,</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Well, Captain Fairfax, as soon after the marriage as</p>
<p class="p1">convenient,—instantly after the ceremony, if you please,—you must bring</p>
<p class="p1">your bride down, and pass some weeks with us.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“I thank you, Mrs. Clifton; I profoundly thank you, but we are going</p>
<p class="p1">immediately to England. Ida pines to see her father, who is a country</p>
<p class="p1">curate, in Devonshire. She has never been reconciled with him since her</p>
<p class="p1">first unfortunate marriage. I have promised to take her to him, and so</p>
<p class="p1">immediately after the ceremony, we four—that is, Ida, myself and our two</p>
<p class="p1">little girls—are going to embark for Liverpool.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Well, altogether, this has put a surprise upon us, Frank,” said Major</p>
<p class="p1">Clifton, meditatively running his fingers through his hair; “but, when</p>
<p class="p1">you return you will make us a visit. By the way, how long do you intend</p>
<p class="p1">to be absent?”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Until the spring. And now I must really bid you good-bye, regretting</p>
<p class="p1">very much that I cannot carry you both along with me.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">They shook hands cordially, Clifton saying—</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Well, Frank, our very best wishes attend you. May you have much</p>
<p class="p1">happiness!”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Captain Fairfax turned to take leave of Catherine, but she said that she</p>
<p class="p1">would attend him down. She left the room with him. And when the door</p>
<p class="p1">shut behind them, Clifton clasped his hands upon his brow and closed his</p>
<p class="p1">eyes, as in deep thought or prayer. When Kate re-entered the room</p>
<p class="p1">softly, he said—</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Come hither, Catherine!”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">And she came and knelt by his side, and he encircled her with his arm,</p>
<p class="p1">and drew her face down to his bosom, and raising his eyes toward Heaven,</p>
<p class="p1">said—</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“‘A wife is from the Lord!’ Even so, oh, God! How shall I thank Thee?</p>
<p class="p1">Hear me consecrate my whole future life to Thy service, in</p>
<p class="p1">acknowledgment of this, Thy gift.”</p>

<p class="p1">Desire to direct the close attention of all lovers of good novel reading</p>
<p class="p1">to the works and authors contained in their new catalogue, just issued.</p>
<p class="p1">A strict scrutiny is solicited, because the books enumerated in it are</p>
<p class="p1">among the most popular now in existence. In supplying your wants and</p>
<p class="p1">taste in the reading line, it is of the first importance that you should</p>
<p class="p1">give special attention to what is popularly designated entertaining</p>
<p class="p1">reading matter. No library is either attractive or complete without a</p>
<p class="p1">collection of novels and romances. The experience of many years has</p>
<p class="p1">demonstrated that light reading is essential to even the most studious</p>
<p class="p1">men and women, furnishing the mind with healthful recreation; while to</p>
<p class="p1">the young, and to those that have not cultivated a taste for solid works</p>
<p class="p1">of science, it forms one of the best possible training schools,</p>
<p class="p1">gradually establishing, in a pleasant manner, that habit of</p>
<p class="p1">concentration of thought absolutely necessary to read understandingly</p>
<p class="p1">the more ponderous works, which treat of political economy, the</p>
<p class="p1">sciences, and of the arts.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">We publish and sell at very low rates, full and varied editions of the</p>
<p class="p1">works of all the famous American and Foreign Novelists, whose writings</p>
<p class="p1">are very entertaining, specially adapted for all readers. The most of</p>
<p class="p1">them are bound in strong cloth binding, and also in paper covers.</p>

<p class="p1">Gutenberg™ electronic works</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg™</p>
<p class="p1">electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to</p>
<p class="p1">and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property</p>
<p class="p1">(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all</p>
<p class="p1">the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or</p>
<p class="p1">destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg™ electronic works in your</p>
<p class="p1">possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a</p>
<p class="p1">Project Gutenberg™ electronic work and you do not agree to be bound</p>
<p class="p1">by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the</p>
<p class="p1">person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph</p>
<p class="p1">1.E.8.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">1.B. “Project Gutenberg” is a registered trademark. It may only be</p>
<p class="p1">used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who</p>
<p class="p1">agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few</p>
<p class="p1">things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg™ electronic works</p>
<p class="p1">even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See</p>
<p class="p1">paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project</p>
<p class="p1">Gutenberg™ electronic works if you follow the terms of this</p>
<p class="p1">agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg™</p>
<p class="p1">electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (“the</p>
<p class="p1">Foundation” or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection</p>
<p class="p1">of Project Gutenberg™ electronic works. Nearly all the individual</p>
<p class="p1">works in the collection are in the public domain in the United</p>
<p class="p1">States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the</p>
<p class="p1">United States and you are located in the United States, we do not</p>
<p class="p1">claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,</p>
<p class="p1">displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as</p>
<p class="p1">all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope</p>
<p class="p1">that you will support the Project Gutenberg™ mission of promoting</p>
<p class="p1">free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg™</p>
<p class="p1">works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the</p>
<p class="p1">Project Gutenberg™ name associated with the work. You can easily</p>
<p class="p1">comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the</p>

<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern</p>
<p class="p1">what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are</p>
<p class="p1">in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,</p>
<p class="p1">check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this</p>
<p class="p1">agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,</p>
<p class="p1">distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any</p>
<p class="p1">other Project Gutenberg™ work. The Foundation makes no</p>

<p class="p1">Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg™</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Project Gutenberg™ is synonymous with the free distribution of</p>
<p class="p1">electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of</p>
<p class="p1">computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It</p>
<p class="p1">exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations</p>
<p class="p1">from people in all walks of life.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the</p>
<p class="p1">assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg™'s</p>
<p class="p1">goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg™ collection will</p>
<p class="p1">remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project</p>
<p class="p1">Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure</p>
<p class="p1">and permanent future for Project Gutenberg™ and future</p>
<p class="p1">generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary</p>
<p class="p1">Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see</p>

<p class="p1">501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the</p>

<p class="p1">Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg</p>
<p class="p1">Literary Archive Foundation</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Project Gutenberg™ depends upon and cannot survive without</p>
<p class="p1">widespread public support and donations to carry out its mission of</p>
<p class="p1">increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be</p>
<p class="p1">freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest</p>
<p class="p1">array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations</p>
<p class="p1">($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt</p>
<p class="p1">status with the IRS.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating</p>
<p class="p1">charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United</p>
<p class="p1">States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a</p>
<p class="p1">considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up</p>
<p class="p1">with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations</p>
<p class="p1">where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND</p>
<p class="p1">DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular</p>
<p class="p1">state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we</p>
<p class="p1">have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition</p>
<p class="p1">against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who</p>
<p class="p1">approach us with offers to donate.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make</p>
<p class="p1">any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from</p>
<p class="p1">outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation</p>
<p class="p1">methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other</p>
<p class="p1">ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To</p>

<p class="p1">Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project</p>
<p class="p1">Gutenberg™ concept of a library of electronic works that could be</p>

<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“THE CURSE OF CLIFTON; OR, THE WIDOWED BRIDE” will be found, on perusal</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">by all, to be equal, if not superior, to any of the previous works by</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">the celebrated American authoress, Mrs. Emma D. E. N. Southworth, who is</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">now conceded by critics to be the most popular female writer living, and</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">her works to be among the greatest novels in the English language, as</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">well as the most splendid pictures of American life ever written. “THE</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">CURSE OF CLIFTON” shows all the grace, vigor, and absorbing interest to</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">be found in “Ishmael” and “Self-Raised,” her last two works, and places</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Mrs. Southworth in the front rank of living novelists. The same</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">indescribable charm pervades all her works, which can only emanate from</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">a female mind, and the excellences of “THE CURSE OF CLIFTON” are many</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">and great. It is a model book—graphic, brilliant and original. The</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">romance is glowing and bold, possessing an absorbing interest that can</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">attach only to real existences and life-like portraitures. The</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">characters are beautifully drawn, and the novel throughout is highly</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">exciting and of unexceptionable moral tendency. It ought to be read by</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">everybody in the cheap form in which it is now issued.</span></p>

<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Upon a glorious morning, in the mid-summer of 18—, two equestrian</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">travellers spurred their horses up the ascent of the Eagle’s Flight, the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">loftiest and most perilous pass of the Alleghanies.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Though the sun was near the meridian, and all the sky above was “darkly,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">deeply, beautifully blue,” and perfectly clear, yet all the earth</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">beneath was covered by a thick, low-lying fog.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">On reaching the highest point of the pass, both travellers drew rein and</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">paused, looking—North, South, East, West—over the ocean of vapor rolling</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">from horizon to horizon below them! And while they so pause, let us</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">catch that nearly vertical ray of the sun that falls upon them, lighting</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">up the group like fire above the fog, and daguerreotype them as they</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">stand.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Both are young men of about the same age, probably twenty-five; both are</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">well mounted upon fine bay horses, and both wear the undress uniform of</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">the ———— Regiment of Cavalry; and here all resemblance between them</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">ceases.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">He on the right hand, who holds in his horse’s head with so tight a</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">rein, causing the gallant steed to arch his beautiful neck so</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">gracefully, while he lets fly a falcon-glance around the shrouded</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">horizon, is Archer Clifton, of Clifton, now holding the rank of Captain</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">in the —— Regiment of Cavalry. His form is of middle size, strongly</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">built, yet elegantly proportioned. His complexion is dark and bronzed as</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">by exposure; his features are Roman; his hair and whiskers trimly cut,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">are of the darkest chestnut, with what painters call _cool_ lights,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">which is to say, that there is no warmth of coloring even where the sun</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">lights. Indeed, there is no warmth about the looks of the whole man. His</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">eyes are singularly beautiful and brilliant, combining all those dark,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">shifting, scintillating, prismatic hues, that would drive an artist mad,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">for want of colors to portray, or an author to despair, for lack of</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">words to describe. He wears the dark blue uniform of his regiment, and</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">manages his noble charger with the ease and grace only to be found in</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">the accomplished cavalry officer.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">He upon the left hand, who, with languid air and loosened rein, inclines</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">his body forward, permitting his graceful horse to droop his head and</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">scent the earth, as in quest of herbage, is Francis Fairfax, of Green</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Plains, a Lieutenant in the company under the command of Captain</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Clifton. He is of about the same height of Clifton, but his figure is</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">slender almost to fragility. His features are delicate and piquant. His</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">complexion is fair and transparent. His hair is also very fair, and</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">waves off from a forehead so snowy, round and smooth, as to seem</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">child-like, especially with those clear blue eyes, that now brood</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">roguishly under their golden lashes, as in profound quest of mischief,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">and now light up and sparkle with fun and frolic. He _miss_manages his</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">spoiled pet of a steed with the charming _insouciance_, only to be seen</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">in the amateur poet, painter, player, musician, etc., etc., etc. And yet</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">there is sometimes an earnest, thoughtful aspect about the youth, that</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">surprises one into the suspicion that all his levity is superficial, and</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">hides his deeper and better nature, as stubble sometimes covers and</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">conceals a mine of precious metal.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Well!” at last spoke Mr. Fairfax, “it is now about twelve hours since</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">we were emptied out of that atrocious old stage coach, which, for a week</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">past, has been beating us about in its interior, from side to side, and</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">from seat to ceiling, as if we were a lump of butter in an old woman’s</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">churn, and whose kindest turn of all to us was, when it turned over and</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">shook us out down the precipice, and into the trough of the Wolf’s Lick,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">as if we had been apples fed to the pigs. Oh! by the lost baronetcy of</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">the house of Fairfax, my self-esteem will never recover the effects of</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">it! Perdition seize the picturesque at this price! And ever since long</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">before daybreak this morning, have we been wandering about over those</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">mountain tops, with the earth below us hidden in mist and only the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">highest peaks looming through the sea of vapor like islands in the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">ocean! And _we_ plunging wildly about in the fog, like death on the pale</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">horse riding the waves! And to the momentarily recurring risk of riding</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">over some hidden precipice of a thousand feet perpendicular. If this be</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">your glorious mountain scenery, to the demon with it! For I had as lief</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">be on the open sea with the ‘Ancient Mariner!’”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">To this half petulant, half laughing philippic Captain Clifton, while</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">his glance still roved over the shrouded hemisphere, replied, with an</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">indulgent smile—</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“You cannot see the face of the country for the morning veil she chooses</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">to wear. But wait till high noon, when the sun, her royal lover, in the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">meridian of his glory, shall raise that gauzy covering, and she, like a</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">right royal bride, shall smile and blush in light and glory.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“By my soul, I could fancy the lady earth wore this veil to conceal fast</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">gathering tears, rather than smiles or blushes! _Anglicé_, I think we</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">shall have rain soon—though blistered be my tongue for saying it!—not</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">about the rain but about the veil! For, look you! Fret as I may at this</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">journey through the mist—yet this fine scenery, under a cloud as it</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">literally _is_, gives me a feeling of breadth, grandeur! I expand,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">spread out over the vast area of its shrouded solitudes. Oh! it is only</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">on the boundless sea or on the mountain top, with a hemisphere below me,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">that I feel as if I had room enough to live in! And you give me a</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">feeling of suffocation by drawing in this awful shrouded world to the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">simile of a lady’s veiled face! But it is not to be wondered at! No, by</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">the shade of Marc Antony, and all other great men, who held the whole</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">world light in the balance with a woman’s evanescent smile or tear!</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">everything is _apropos du femmes_ with you now. Could the music of the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">spheres suddenly burst upon your astonished ears, as soon as you had</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">recovered your senses, your highest note of admiration would be to</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">compare that universal diapason of divine harmony to Lady Carolyn’s</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">silver laugh!”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“I do not recollect ever to have heard ‘Lady’ Carolyn laugh.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“_Ten thousand pardons!_ A Clifton of Clifton never laughs. But tell me,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Captain, whereabouts in the world—I mean in the clouds, _are we_? And</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">when shall we see this pure pearl of beauty and the rich casket that</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">enshrines her, this stately lily of the mountains and the parterre where</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">she blooms;—when shall we behold Paradise and the Peri—Clifton and Lady</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Carolyn?”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Without replying to this mock-poetic strain, Captain Clifton remained</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">with his eyes still wandering from East to West, and back again over the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">rolling vapor. And Fairfax continued—</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“I suspect now, by your abstracted air and wandering eye, that you have</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">lost your way in the clouds—not the first time such a thing has happened</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">to a lover, nor would it be strange in a place like this, where the only</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">land-marks are mountain tops sticking out of the fog with a day’s</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">journey between each!”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">At this instant a distant group of peaks broke suddenly through the mist</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">like new isles thrown up by the sea, and glittered whitely in the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">sunlight against the deep blue horizon.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“See!” exclaimed Clifton, roused from his apathy by the sudden</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">apparition. “Look, Fairfax! I will show you White Cliffs! Look straight</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">before you to the Western horizon—a little North of West. You see a</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">crescent of seven peaks rising through the mist against the sky. That is</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">White Cliffs.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Looking white enough at this distance—quite like snow-capped mountains,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">in fact.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Yes. They are of white quartz, and their peaks rising from the girdle</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">of dark evergreens around their base and sides, have quite a cooling</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">effect in hot weather.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Ah! just so. Now how far off are those same blessed refrigerators?”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“About twenty-five miles in a bee-line. But the mountain road is very</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">circuitous, and makes the distance nearly forty. However, if we ride</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">well, we shall be able to reach Clifton in time to surprise Mrs. Clifton</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">at tea.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Heaven be praised for that possibility!” ejaculated Fairfax, as they</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">prepared to descend the mountain side.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">As they rode down, Captain Clifton, warming slightly from his cool</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">reserve, said—</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“I think, Fairfax, that you, poet and artist as you claim to be, will</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">rather like Clifton. Tourists, who have visited our part of the country,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">think the scenery there very fine. It impresses _me_ merely as being</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">unique. There is something formal—but, to myself, not therefore</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">unpleasing in that crescent of seven peaks—the tallest being in the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">centre and gradually declining thence to the lowest, which may be called</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">the horns of the crescent, and point Southward. Those peaks rise from a</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">forest of—first elms and oaks around their base; then pines farther up</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">their sides; and last of cedars, above which rise the pinnacle of white</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">quartz. This crescent of mountains surrounds and shelters from the North</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">winds the family mansion, which is situated in the woods at its foot.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">North of the peaks, the country is wild and rugged, but partly covered</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">with thick forest, and affording the best hunting grounds in the world.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">There you may course the hare; track the deer; or if your tastes aspire</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">to a fiercer conflict, hunt the wolf, the wild cat, or the bear—!”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“—Or the rattle-snake, copper-head, or moccasin! Thank you, I have no</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">inclination for crusade against those mountaineers,” laughed Fairfax.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Perhaps you like angling? There is a trout stream at the foot of the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">wooded lawn, in front of the house. I must tell you about that, for it</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">is the head waters of a fine river.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“From the Western cliff there springs a torrent that with many a leap,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">and fall, and rebound, tumbles tumultuously down the side of the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">mountain, and falling into a channel at the foot of the lawn flows</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">calmly on, until it meets a second fall, from whence it goes hurrying</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">on, through forests, fields and rocks, taking tribute from many a</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">mountain torrent, and many a meadow-stream, and widening as it goes,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">until it becomes a mighty river, rushing on, to pour its floods into the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">majestic James. After which, they both go on, breaking through range</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">after range of mountains, and so conquer their passage to the sea—even</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">as in the feudal days of the olden country, some mountain chieftain,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">gathering his vassals together, came rushing down from his highland</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">home, and laying all the country under tribute in his course, hurried on</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">to throw all his treasures at the feet of his sovereign, and go with him</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">to the wars.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Clifton!” said Fairfax, more seriously than he had yet spoken, “all</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">your illustrations—all your metaphors—all your thoughts, fancies and</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">imaginings are—not ‘of the earth, earthy,’ but worse—far worse—of the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">_world_, _worldly_! Of the world, its castes, customs and</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">conventions—its pomps, vanities and falsities! You speak of the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">grandest, the most imposing—oh! let me call it at once, the most</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">magnificent area of mountain scenery in the hemisphere, with all the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">earth, below and around, covered with a sea of vapor that rises and</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">falls, rolling from horizon to horizon, like the waves of the ocean, and</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">you compare it to a veiled royal bride! You describe a mighty</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">mountain-river, rending its passage through the everlasting rocks,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">overleaping, uprooting, bearing down and bearing on all obstacles to its</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">resistless rush towards the sea, and you liken it to a chieftain going</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">to pay tribute to a King! Ah, Clifton of Clifton, the beauty, the glory,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">and the majesty of the _earth_ pleases you, but the ‘pomp, pride, and</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">circumstance’ of the _world_ inspires you! But when was it otherwise</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">with a Clifton, of Clifton? ‘The spirit of intense worldliness has ever</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">been their bane and curse—their sin and its punishment!’” he concluded,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">relapsing into his mock-tragic air.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Ah! so you are familiar with the popular legend that you have just</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">quoted,” said Captain Clifton. “But,” he added, with a sarcastic smile,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“were Georgia here, I think she could refute the charge, and prove one</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Clifton, at least, has been guided by any spirit rather than that of</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">‘intense worldliness.’”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“_Georgia?_”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“I beg her pardon! Mrs. Clifton, of Clifton.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Oh! your aunt! but by my soul, Captain, that was a very irreverent way</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">of introducing the old lady! Do young men in your patriarchal part of</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">the country call old gentlewomen by their Christian names?”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Old gentlewomen!” repeated Clifton slowly, with a musing smile,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">adding—“Georgia is about seventeen years of age, and the most beautiful</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">woman in the world!”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Whe-e-e-ew! I’m amazed! I’m confounded! I’m stunned! Then—the present</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Mrs. Clifton is the _second_ wife?”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“No, sir—Georgia is my uncle’s fourth wife.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Overwhelmed!—annihilated!” exclaimed the young man. “The—the—old</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Blue-beard! the old Henry VIII.! Four wives! Are they all living?—if</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">not, where does he bury his dead?”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“_Fairfax!_” exclaimed Captain Clifton, in a tone, and with a look, that</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">speedily recalled the young man to himself—then he added, rather</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">haughtily—“My Uncle Clifton is a simple, gentle-hearted old man,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">excessively fond of women, but mark you, sir!—it is the affection of the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">patriarch, not of the pacha.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Hang me if ever I saw any difference between Solomon the king, and</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Solimaun the caliph; Abraham the patriarch, and Aroun the pacha, in that</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">respect,” laughed the young man, until, stealing a furtive glance at the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">cold and haughty face of Clifton, he held out his hand, and suddenly</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">exclaimed—“Pardon me, Clifton! or call me out! I—can’t help a jest, to</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">save my soul! but I’ll fight or apologize, or render any other sort of</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">satisfaction afterwards!”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Captain Clifton remembered that Francis Fairfax was his guest, going to</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">spend a long mid-summer furlough at his mother’s house, and so he</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">cleared his brow and answered—</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Nonsense!”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Now tell me about Henry VIII.’s fourth Queen—how long has she been</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">married—I mean the present Mrs. Clifton?”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“About two years. My uncle wedded her when she was fifteen—she is now</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">seventeen—and, as I said, the most beautiful creature that you, or I, or</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">any one else, ever did, or ever shall see, anywhere.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“_Allons_—stop there! False knight and recreant! whose colors do you</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">wear while you uphold the peerless beauty of Georgia? What would Miss</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Clifton of Clifton say to your admiration?”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Ridiculous, sir! Miss Clifton is herself very beautiful but not the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">_most_ beautiful. Miss Clifton has _other_ and _rarer_ distinctions, I</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">am proud to say?”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Oh, I understand—her family _name_!—nevertheless, be hanged if I don’t</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">believe you have been in love with Georgia!”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Impossible, sir! The perfect beauty of the young girl struck me</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">forcibly, as it strikes _all others_—nay, more—impressed my</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">imagination deeply perhaps. I confess to a _penchant_ for female</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">beauty—and—observe—it is the artist’s taste, sir, not the sultan’s.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">But in love with Georgia! Impossible, sir! She was a girl of humble</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">parentage!”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Ah! then you think it quite ‘impossible’ that a gentleman born, should</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">be in love with a girl of ‘humble parentage?’”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Preposterous, sir!—utterly preposterous! Pray, let us hear no more</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">about it!”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Yet your uncle—”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“My uncle married such an one, you would say. Old gentlemen, living on</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">their own estates, will do such things. And the world charitably</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">ascribes it to dotage, smiles and forgives them. You will oblige me by</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">changing the subject, Frank.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Fairfax fell into reverie, and Clifton dropped into thought, and they</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">rode on for some time in silence, and in—joy—until—</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Floods and furies! Fire and flames!! Lightning and tempests, and sudden</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">death!!!” exclaimed Fairfax, rearing and backing his horse with a</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">terrible jerk, and throwing himself from the saddle, bathed in</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">perspiration, and shaking with terror. “Look! Look there! There at your</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">feet! Back! Back your horse, unless you wish to ride straight to the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">kingdom of Heaven, or—to the other place! Oh, blessed Lord! I shall</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">never survive the shock!”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Captain Clifton backed his horse, dismounted, and following the index of</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Fairfax, approached the brink of the awful abyss, and looked down a</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">perpendicular precipice of more than a thousand feet, with the remaining</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">distance lost in shadows and dim vapors, while faintly to the ear came a</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">low and hollow murmur, as of the roaring of many waters at a vast depth!</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“This is the head of the Devil’s Staircase! We have lost our way!” said</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Captain Clifton.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Devil’s Staircase! I should think it was! Ugh! Oooo-oo-ooh! I shall</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">never survive it! Where does it lead to? Tell me that! To the infernal</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">regions, I suppose, of course. Ur-r-r-r-r!” exclaimed Fairfax, with his</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">teeth chattering.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“We have indeed made a very narrow escape,” said Captain Clifton, gazing</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">thoughtfully down the horrible pit.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Narrow escape! Ur-r-r-r-r!” exclaimed Frank, shaking, shuddering, and</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">streaming with cold perspiration. “I tell you, when I was providentially</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">led to look down, and saw the fog roll away from beneath my horse’s</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">feet, and reveal that ghastly—Ur-r-r-r-r! Ur-r-r-r-r! I believe I shall</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">chatter my teeth to powder!”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Come, come, Fairfax! this is really unmanly. Thank an ever-watchful</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Providence, that has preserved you from a sudden and horrible death, and</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">calm yourself. Be a man!”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Be a man! You might as well say to my shuddering horse, there—be a</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">horse! This is unhorsely! Ur-r-r-r-r. I tell you it has given me the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">tertian ague!”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Why, Frank! Really!”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Look at my horse—look even at that dumb beast! Yes, look at that</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">gallant steed, who would charge upon a phalanx of fixed bayonets, and</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">impale himself upon their points, if spurred to it—look at him!</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Positively frozen with terror!”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Fairfax, you astonish me—certainly you are not really so much</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">overcome.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Overcome! My nerves are shattered to atoms, I tell you! Ur-r-r-r-r! It</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">has given me the tertian ague, and the St. Vitus’ dance! both together!</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Ur-r-r-r-r!”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Now who would have supposed you to be a—of such a nervous temperament!</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Come, let me assist you to mount, and then away.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“What! And at the end of the next hundred yards, ride headlong over a</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">precipice of fifteen hundred feet, and before night find sepulchre in</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">the maws of fifty turkey-buzzards! I tell you there is neither a</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">glorious death, an honorable burial nor an immortal fame to be found in</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">such a fate! Heavens and earth, no! For instance—‘Whatever became of</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">that poor devil, Fairfax?’ asks one. ‘Oh, one day, crossing the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">mountains in a fog, with his head in a mist, he had the awkwardness to</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">pitch himself headforemost down the Devil’s Ladder, in the Alleghanies,’</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">answers t’other. ‘_Poor creature!_ He was always a miserable—but where</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">was he buried?’ ‘He wa’n’t buried—the crows eat him up,’ etc., etc.,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">etc.! Oh! I know what my posthumous fame would be in such a case. Quite</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">different from that of the future Major-General Francis Fairfax, who,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">fifty years hence, at a good old age, shall die in his downy bed, with</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">the archbishop praying by him, and be buried with the highest honors of</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">war, and have a national monument raised to his fame, emblazoning his</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">immortal services to his grateful country, in receiving her honors and</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">emoluments for more that half a century! Can’t give up that glorious</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">future for the sake of dashing myself to pieces this afternoon, Clifton.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">No!” said the young man, folding his arms, and striking an attitude</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">_a-la-Napoleon_, “I have a destiny to fulfill, and shall not stir from</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">this spot until the mist rises or falls.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Mr. Fairfax! It is now drawing late in the afternoon. We shall have a</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">storm before night; and a storm on the mountains, let me tell you, is a</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">much more delightful thing to read about in Childe Harold, while</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">stretched at your ease upon the settee in your shady piazza, than to</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">take in _propria personæ_ on the Alleghanies,” said Captain Clifton,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">quietly.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Only warrant me from bringing up suddenly to the jumping-off place</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">before I know it—and I’ll make an attempt! Yea! let him only insure my</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">body unharmed by fire or water, and I’ll valiantly follow my leader</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">through flood and flame!” replied Frank, recovering himself with a few</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">more shudders, and preparing to mount.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“We have left the right road about two miles behind,” said Captain</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Clifton, turning his horse’s head and leading the way.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">The fog below was condensing very fast. From the North-Western horizon</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">black clouds were rising behind masses of foaming white vapor. The air</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">was still and oppressive, and from all around came a faint, low moaning</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">sound, as if nature cowered and trembled before the coming of the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">terrible “storm king.” The fog was now rolling down and gathering into</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">clouds below them—revealing the majestic features of the landscape,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">mountains, vales and forests, rocks, glens and waterfalls, in wild and</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">magnificent confusion—all wearing now a savage and gloomy aspect under</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">the shadow of the coming storm. Captain Clifton’s eye had been</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">constantly on the alert in hope of discovering some mountain cabin,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">which might shelter them from the fury of the tempest, but as yet his</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">search was unsuccessful—no human dwelling even of the humblest</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">description was to be seen. At length the attention of the travellers</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">was attracted by the faint tingling of a bell—then by the bleating of</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">sheep—and then from the deep clouded glen at their right, sprung up into</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">their path a bell-wether followed by two—five—ten—a whole flock of</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">sheep; and driven by a girl on a pony; a little coarse, sun-burned girl,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">in a boy’s coarse straw hat and a homespun gown, riding on a little</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">rough-coated, wiry, mountain pony.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“A shepherdess, by all that is romantic,” exclaimed Fairfax, vaulting</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">aside to let the sheep pass. Then springing to the side of the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">rough-coated pony, he doffed his hat to the rider and said—</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“My good girl—for the love of Providence, will you tell us where we can</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">find shelter from the storm?”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">The child raised her fine eyes to the stranger’s face with the look of a</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">startled fawn—and dropped them again instantly. Fairfax repeated his</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">question. The child stole another furtive glance at the fine gentleman</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">in the very fine uniform, and then at her own coarse raiment, and</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">blushed deeply. But before Fairfax could reiterate his request, she</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">said, quietly—</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Grandfather’s cabin is not far off, if you and the other gentleman will</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">come with me.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“With great pleasure—and ten thousand thanks, my dear little girl. Be so</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">good as to lead the way.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">The flock of sheep had gone on before. The girl put her pony in motion,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">and the gentlemen followed—Mr. Fairfax addressing all his conversation</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">to his little companion; and Captain Clifton riding on in silence and</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">abstraction.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">The sky was darkening very fast, and great single drops of rain</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">occasionally falling. They quickened their pace, and after riding</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">briskly several hundred yards, came to the head of a glen, deep down in</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">which was seen a small, lone cabin. At this instant the sheet lightning</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">glared from horizon to horizon, followed by a report as of exploded and</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">falling rocks, and then the rain came down in a deluge. The darkness was</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">so dense now as to hide their way. The girl jumped from her pony, and</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">giving him a little slap that sent him travelling down the path, went up</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">to the head of Clifton’s horse and said, shyly—</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“You can’t see the way, sir, and you don’t know the road—let me lead</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">your horse.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“By no means, my good girl,” replied Clifton, speaking in a tone of</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">haughty astonishment.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Without reply the child turned from him and went towards Fairfax. And at</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">the same instant a thunderbolt was hurled from Heaven with a terrific</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">crash, riving the ground on which she had just stood. When the panic was</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">over, the first thought of Captain Clifton was for the safety of that</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">presumptuous child. A glare of lightning revealed her lying on the rock.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">He hastened to her side.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“My dear child, are you hurt,” he asked, dismounting and stooping to</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">lift her.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Oh! sir, I am so glad to hear you speak! I thought you were struck.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Are you hurt?”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Oh no, sir, I was only thrown down,” replied the child, lightly</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">springing to her feet.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Oh, yes! Exchange your mutual condolences and congratulations. But who</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">the mischief cares whether I am hurt or not?” exclaimed Fairfax,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">stumbling along towards them—for he also had dismounted.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“You were entirely out of danger,” replied Clifton.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Out of danger! Who the deuce is out of danger within a hundred miles of</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">these infernal mountains?”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">The rain was still pouring down in floods, and in the interval of the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">thunder, the roar of the swollen torrents was deafening. The question</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">now was, whether to remain standing there exposed to all the fury of the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">storm, or to attempt the now dangerous descent into the glen.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“I could lead your horses down in safety, if you would let me, for I</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">know every inch of the road so well,” said the girl.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Another blinding glare of lightning, another terrific peal of thunder,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">and another deluge of rain, put a stop to all reply. At last the child</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">repeated her offer, saying that she could lead the horses down very</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">well, “one at a time.” But, of course, that was not for a moment to be</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">thought of by the young men. And her plan was rejected at once.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Well, then, the only way will be to go down on foot, and leave your</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">horses here to follow. For you will need your hands as well as your feet</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">in groping down the slippery rock through the darkness,” said the girl.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">After a little more consultation, her last proposition was adopted, and</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">they began the descent on foot.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">After some twenty minutes’ toil and struggle through darkness and</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">deluge, thunder and lightning, they reached the lowly door of the cabin,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">pushed it hastily open, and hurried in.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">It was very dark, and nothing was to be seen but the red glow of a few</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">smouldering embers on the hearth. Towards these the girl went.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“And what do you think has become of your flock of sheep, my good girl?”</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">inquired Frank, kindly, remembering her interests while he stood there</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">wringing the water out of his coat skirts.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Oh, the bell-wether has led them all into the pen long ago, sir. They</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">are always safe when they are once in the glen,” replied the child, as</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">she lighted a candle.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">The sudden glare of the light showed a rude apartment, with an earth</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">floor, log walls, and a fire-place of unhewn stone. On the right of the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">fire-place stood a poor bedstead, upon which lay a venerable,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">white-haired old man, covered with a faded counterpane, and near the bed</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">sat an old, chip-bottomed arm-chair. On the left of the fire-place were</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">two rough plank shelves, the lower shelf adorned with a few pewter</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">plates and mugs; the upper one filled with——books!—piles of old dingy,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">musty books; and near these shelves stood a spinning-wheel, with a</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">broach of yarn on the spindle, and a basket of broaches under it. At the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">opposite end of the room, one corner was occupied by a little old oak</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">table, and the other by a ladder leading up through a trap-door into the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">loft overhead. A few rude stools were ranged along the walls, junks of</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">smoked venison, ropes of onions, bunches of dried herbs, hanks of yarn,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">and the old man’s old hat and coat garnished the walls. All this was</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">seen at a glance.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Is your grandfather sick?” inquired Frank.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">The girl turned her eyes wistfully towards the venerable sleeper, and</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">did not reply.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Is your grandfather sick?” repeated Fairfax.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">The child raised her eyes sorrowfully to the face of the young man, and</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">remained silent.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Is he so _very_ sick?” earnestly reiterated Frank.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“He is not sick, sir,” answered the girl, in a low, sad voice.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“What is the matter with him, then?” thoughtlessly persisted Frank.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Without reply, the girl dropped her eyes, and blushing deeply, turned</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">away. Setting the candle down upon the table, she took a pail of water</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">and went up the ladder, and into the loft. After an absence of a few</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">minutes, she returned, and said—</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“If you will go up stairs now, you will find two suits of grandfather’s</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">and Carl’s Sunday clothes. They are not fine, but they are clean and</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">dry.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Our wet and jaded travellers thanked their young hostess, and prepared</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">to accept her offer.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“And if,” she added, “you would like to rest after so much fatigue,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">there is a bed.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">They reached the loft, and found it a small, low place, with a little</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">window, and a little, clean bed. On the bed lay the two suits of</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">homespun, and two coarse towels. And on a stool near, sat a pail of</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">water and a tin basin.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“I do believe that little girl has given us her own sanctuary. What a</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">dear little thing she is!—so full of courage, and shyness, too! If she</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">were two or three years older, and a great deal prettier, I could fancy</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">myself writing poetry about her,” said Frank.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Clifton made no comment—he was engaged in divesting himself of his wet</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">garments, and thinking about—Miss Clifton.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">When they had refreshed themselves by washing and changing their dress,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Frank threw himself upon the bed, stretched out his limbs luxuriously,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">and declared that the rustic’s clothes were very loose and comfortable,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">and his own position truly delightful. Captain Clifton walked to the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">window, and looked out at the storm, which was now abating.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Frank was already sound asleep.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">And while Clifton stood at the window, drawing comparisons between the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">meanness of the hut in which he found himself, and the magnificence of</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">the mountain scenery around it, he heard—in that small, shell-like</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">cabin—he could not help hearing—what follows. First a heave and plunge,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">as if the old man below stairs had started violently from his bed and</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">fallen again, and then a fearful, shuddering voice exclaimed, “Kate!</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Kate! they’re coming again! They’re after me, Kate! They’re on me!</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">They’re on me! Save me, Kate! Save me, Kate! Save—”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Grandfather—dear grandfather,” said the soothing voice of the girl,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“there is no one here but me—there, there, be quiet—be still; nothing</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">shall hurt you here—nothing can you know.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Look! Look, Kate! Look! They’re not men now but devils!” A violent</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">plunge, struggles, exclamations of terror and despair which the low,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">soothing tones and gestures of the poor girl vainly assayed to</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">tranquillize for some time, and then—silence for a few minutes—which was</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">again interrupted by—“Snakes! snakes, Kate! Snakes! _Green_ snakes! See!</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">see how they dart! They fly! They’re on me! They’re on me! Help! Help!”</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">And the sound of the maniac laying about him furiously. Captain Clifton</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">started up with the intention of going to the poor girl’s assistance—but</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">by the time he reached the head of the ladder, the voice of the child</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">had again calmed the infuriated man.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">All was quiet for a quarter of an hour, and then another violent start</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">and throw that seemed to shake the little hut, and a horrible shriek</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">of—“A dragon! A dragon. Kate! A green dragon belching flame!” Then a</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">succession of violent shrieks and struggles, which aroused Frank, who</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">springing up in bed, exclaimed—</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“What the deuce is the matter? Has the Major got another fit of</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">_mania-a-potu_ on him?” Then, as all again was quiet, he rubbed his eyes</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">and said, laughing, “I do believe I have been talking in my sleep! I</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">dreamed we were in our mess, and the Major was drunk again.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“A part of your dream was real. The old man below stairs has a fit of</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">_mania-a-potu_ upon him.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“What! and you staying here! I must go down and help the girl.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“You had better not as yet. She seems to have the power of soothing him.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Your presence might, by exasperating him, do more harm than good.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">At this moment another outbreak of fury from the madman caused Frank to</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">spring to his feet, and, exclaiming—</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“I can’t let that maniac tear my dear little hostess to pieces—” rush to</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">the head of the ladder.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“I tell you you had best not _intrude_—his mania seems perfectly</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">harmless to the child.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">But Frank was at the foot of the ladder, where, however, an impediment</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">met him. The girl, who had just succeeded in again soothing the madman,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">came and stood before him, saying, “Pray do not come in, sir, just yet.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“But, my good girl, I must come in and remain to protect you,” gently</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">trying to pass her. She stood her ground firmly; her _lips_ said—</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“I am not in any danger. I beg you, sir, do not come in yet;” but her</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">steady and rather threatening _glance_ said—“Do not dare to look upon</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">the old man in his degradation!”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Frank turned back, and went and perched himself at the top of the ladder</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">to watch over the safety of the girl, and be ready in case of exigency.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">He saw the old man lying, clutching the cover around him, while his</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">terror-dilated eyes glared out like a wild beast’s from its lair—all</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">ready for another start and spring! He saw the girl mix a mug of strong</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">vinegar and water, and take it to him, and the old man grasp and quaff</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">it with fiery thirst; three times she filled the mug, and three times he</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">gulped its contents with voracity. Then she laid his aged head tenderly</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">down, and went and saturated a cloth with vinegar, and placed it about</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">his burning forehead and temples. Next she took a rustic fan of turkey</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">feathers and stood by him and fanned him until he fell into a sleep,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">that every moment became deeper and deeper. Finally she gently laid down</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">the fan, sunk upon her knees by the bedside, and bowed her head upon her</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">clasped hands in silent prayer. At last she arose, pressed a light kiss</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">upon the furrowed brow of the sleeper, and silently went about her</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">household work.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">From a shed at the back of the house she brought wood and water, made up</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">the fire, filled and hung on the teakettle, set an oven and oven-lid to</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">heat, and again disappeared through the back door into the shed. In</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">about fifteen minutes she returned with a tray of dough and a pan of</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">venison steaks. She made her dough into a loaf and put it in the oven to</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">bake, and prepared her venison steaks to lay upon the coals. She set her</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">table with milk and cream, and butter, brought in, doubtless from a</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">rude, but cool spring-house, near at hand.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">When all was done, she sat down to knit, seeming to wait the coming of</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">another—for she often paused and listened with her head turned towards</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">the door, and at length got up and drew from under the bed a trunk,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">whence she took an old, well-patched but clean suit of homespun clothes,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">with a shirt and a pair of socks, and hung them over a chair.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Soon after a step was heard without—the door was thrown open, and a</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">thin, dark young man, dressed as a farm laborer, entered. Throwing his</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">coarse hat to the other end of the room, he approached the fire, when</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">seeing the situation of the old man he stopped short, and placing his</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">arms akimbo, gazed on him, exclaiming—</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Drunk again, by ——!” and then turned, with an interrogative look,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">towards the girl.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">A short wave of the hand—a quick, distressful nod, and the choking down</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">of a sob, told him that it was so.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">The young man let down his arms, and with a frown of mingled sorrow and</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">anger approached and gazed upon the sleeper.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Have you had much trouble with him, dear Kate?”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">The same choking sob and quick nod answered him.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“_Where_ DID he get the liquor? What has he laid his hands on and sold</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">now—any of my books?”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“No! no!—it was my bonnet—but never mind, I can wear your old hat, you</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">know!—it doesn’t matter for me!”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Well, now, by all that’s—”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Hush, hush, Carl! Don’t swear—he is our grandfather, you know; and</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">besides,” she added, suddenly dropping her voice, “there are strangers</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">up stairs.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Strangers! What strangers?”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Two gentlemen who came in here out of the storm.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Umph!” said the young man, dropping himself into the arm-chair and</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">falling into deep thought, from which he was aroused by the voice of</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Kate, saying—</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Carl, don’t sit down in your wet clothes; take those on the chair, and</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">go in the shed and put them on. And make haste, please, Carl, because</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">supper is nearly ready, and the gentlemen up stairs must be hungry.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">The young man arose, with a heavy sigh, saying—</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“I’ll only change my jacket, that I can do here. Oh! Kate!” he</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">continued, as he divested himself of his wet jacket, and drew on the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">other—“Oh! Kate! what between one thing and another this is no home for</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">you! _Indeed, indeed_, every morning I go away from you with a heavy</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">heart, and all day long I can hardly work for the dread that’s on my</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">mind about you. If I could only find a place for you to wait on some</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">lady, or to nurse a baby—but, Lord! what with the niggers there is never</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">a place to be got here for a poor white girl.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Oh, Carl, if you could get me the best place in the world—even a place</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">to sew—I wouldn’t leave _him_. Why, Carl, it would break his heart. He</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">would grieve himself to death!”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“And better for him that he should be dead! And better for you and all</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">concerned!”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Oh, don’t say so, Carl! Don’t say so! Come and look at him, and let the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">sight soften your heart to him,” said the girl, taking the youth’s hand,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">and drawing him to the bedside. “Look, now, at that poor old wrinkled</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">face—it has not got very long to live, anyhow—and see the two or three</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">thin, white hairs on his temples—and see the poor, _poor_ withered</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">hands—so helpless! Oh! I think it is all so pitiful. And now see, he is</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">asleep, but how much trouble there is on his poor old face—no, no! don’t</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">say hard things of him, it cuts me to the heart! And, Carl, no matter</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">how bad his fit may be, he never offers to hurt me or anything else.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Only terror and horror is all that is on him! He is a gentle, harmless,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">poor old man. And I always pity him like I pity any one very ill.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Kate! I dare say you think this is all tender-heartedness, and you give</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">yourself a great deal of credit for it! But I tell you it’s nothing but</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">weakness. And it may be the ruin of you, too, before long. And now I</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">tell you, I’m going to get a place for you, if I can. Yes, and make you</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">go to it, too. I can do without you—that is, I _must_ do without you! I</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">can get the breakfast before I go away in the morning. And I can leave</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">something for the old man’s dinner, and come home time enough in the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">evening to get his supper! And to-morrow I am going down to the turnpike</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">gate to thrash Scroggings, and bring your bonnet home. And I’ll tell him</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">if ever he lets the old man have any more liquor, I’ll kick him round</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">his groggery till he hasn’t got a whole bone left in his body. Yes, and</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">I’ll do it, too!”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Kate was placing the supper on the table, but she turned, with the same</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">expression of countenance with which she had stopped Fairfax at the foot</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">of the stairs, and said—</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“I should be very sorry for any violence from you, Carl. But of one</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">thing be sure—do what you may, I will never, _never_ leave our</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">grandfather!”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“There! now, whenever you get that hateful Maria Theresa look, I _hate_</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">you, Katterin! I hate to see strength in women! It don’t belong to them,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">nor grace them, anyhow!”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Strength of _affection_ does, Carl. But now please call the gentlemen</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">down to supper,” said Kate.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Carl rapped at the foot of the ladder, and summoned the travellers</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">accordingly.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Now, though Fairfax had honorably withdrawn from the trap-door, the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">moment he found that his services would not be required, and that the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">conversation between Kate and Carl was growing confidential, yet every</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">word of that conversation had been distinctly heard by both young men,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">and had produced an effect upon both. Frank with difficulty withheld</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">himself from exclaiming aloud, as pity, disgust, anger or approbation</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">moved him in turn. Captain Clifton, far less impressible, and more</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">reserved than his companion, had remained perfectly quiet and silent,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">though his thoughts were more practically busy with the case than those</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">of his companion. They went down, and were received at the foot of the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">ladder by Carl, who, with a sort of rough politeness, placed stools at</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">the table, and invited them to be seated. They placed themselves at the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">board, at the head of which Kate already presided, with folded hands and</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">downcast eyes. Then to their utter astonishment, the rude, irreverent</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">young man, Carl, stood up and asked a blessing, saying, afterwards, that</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">he was no parson, nor no Methodist, but Kate would have it so, and he</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">thought it was best upon the whole, not to oppose females in such</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">notions, And then he began to wait upon his guests.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Their supper consisted of good coffee, with cream and maple sugar; good</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">bread, with fresh butter and cheese; venison steak and broiled chickens;</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">and lastly, of a dish of baked pears, cold, and a pitcher of milk. Frank</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">was surprised to find such excellence of fare amid the ragged poverty of</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">the mountain cabin; but, on afterwards expressing this surprise to</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Captain Clifton, he was told by the latter, that such contrasts were by</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">no means rare. Mr. Fairfax applied himself with zeal to the good things</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">before him, until the sharpness of his appetite was sated, and then</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">lingered long over the meal, conversing with his host upon the state of</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">the country in his region, the climate and soil, productions, market,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">etc., and receiving from the young mountaineer the information that</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">there was no great amount of produce about there, except in the glens,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">grazing for the cattle, and that the roads were so bad, and the towns</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">and villages so distant, that nothing was raised for market, except such</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">kind of produce as could walk thither, to wit: flocks and herds. That</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">his grandfather, before the infirmities of age had come upon him, had</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">raised herds of kine and hogs, which he drove fifty miles to market</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">every year; but that was some years ago, when he himself was a child.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">That now they only had a few sheep, which his sister tended while he was</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">at work on a plantation at the foot of the mountain. In reply to a</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">question Frank put while leisurely using his gold tooth-pick, the young</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">man informed him farther that himself and his sister were of German and</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Irish descent. That the old man, their grandfather, was a German by</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">birth, but had lived nearly seventy years in America. That his name was</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Carl Wetzel, and his only daughter, Caterina, had been married to an</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Irish emigrant, of the name of Kavanagh. That _they_ were the parents of</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">himself and sister. Finally, that they had been dead nearly seven years.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">It was farther ascertained that old Carl Wetzel had been a man of</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">considerable education; and it was easily seen that Carl Kavanagh had</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">inherited much of his father’s Irish quickness of intelligence, and much</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">of his grandfather’s German love of knowledge.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Frank, on his part, was equally communicative, and, in spite of the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">haughty reserve of Captain Clifton, informed his host that he had come</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">up in that neighborhood for the purpose of acting as groomsman at the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">approaching marriage of his friend, Captain Clifton, of the —— Regiment</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">of Cavalry, to his cousin, Miss Carolyn Gower Clifton, of Clifton Place.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">That their journey, so far, had been rather disastrous; that they had</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">set out from Washington City on horseback, but had become so fatigued by</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">the excessive heat, that they had been obliged, on arriving at</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Winchester, to take places for themselves in the stage for Staunton, and</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">to hire a man to bring their horses after them—riding one and leading</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">the other, and so alternately. That before reaching Staunton, they had</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">been thrown from the stage—without serious injury to themselves,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">however, and had been obliged to walk some ten miles to a village on</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">their route, and wait the arrival of their horses, which, fortunately,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">were not many hours behind them. That they had ridden all day in a thick</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">fog, lost their way, came near going over a fearful precipice, and</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">finally got caught in the tempest that drove them for shelter to the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">cabin.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">During all this time, Captain Clifton had seemed lost in thought, and</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">only once spoke to inquire of the young mountaineer whether it were</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">possible for them to pursue their journey that night. To this the young</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">man replied that it would be impossible, even if it were then daylight,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">inasmuch as the torrents were swollen so greatly. And at the thought of</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">pursuing their journey, a pang of remorse for his forgetfulness of his</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">horses shot through the breast of Frank, and—</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“What the devil can have become of Saladin?” he exclaimed, starting up.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Oh, he is safe,” answered Clifton. “I saw them both in the shed as I</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">looked from the little window up stairs.’</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Who put them there?”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“I tended them,” answered the girl, quietly.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">They all now arose from the table. The girl cleared the board, and</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">carried all the things out to wash up. Carl begged his guests to excuse</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">him, and went out to give the horses a rub down and another feed.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Captain Clifton threw himself into the arm-chair, crossed his legs, took</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">out his tablets, and began to make memorandums.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Frank impertinently peeped over his shoulder and read—“Mem. Ask my</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">mother if she can take a little girl as a companion.” Clifton closed the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">book instantly, in silent rebuke of Frank’s impudence. And Frank himself</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">walked about fidgety and unhappy for not knowing what to do with</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">himself, until, at a restless movement of the old man, he went and</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">poured out a mug of water, and carefully keeping behind the eye of the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">patient, lifted up his head and gave him drink, and after setting down</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">the empty mug, fanned him till he went sound asleep again.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">The brother and sister soon returned. Carl sat down and begun his best</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">efforts at entertainment. But Frank, who amused himself by seeing</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">everything, saw Kate go up stairs into the loft and bring down and carry</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">out his own and his friend’s regimentals.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">After which she came in, and drawing a stool to the table, sat down and</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">began to knit, as quietly, as silently, as if no strangers were in her</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">hut.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Carl took down and laid upon the table a rough draught board, and</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">invited his guests to play with each other.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Frank eagerly caught at the opportunity, but Captain Clifton declined,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">on the plea of distaste to the amusement.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Play with me, my dear fellow, for pity sake,” said Frank to Carl, “and</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">don’t mind my friend there! You see, he doesn’t want to play, neither</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">does he want to talk, nor to do anything but sit and think about Miss</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Clifton.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Do play with him, and keep him quiet, if you can, my good youth,” said</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Captain Clifton, turning his chair slightly aside from the table, so</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">that his face was in the shade. Opposite to him, at the other corner of</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">the table, sat Katherine, with the light shining full upon her face and</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">head, as she bowed it over her work. Captain Clifton did not fall into a</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">brown study, he fell into a study of the brown girl. Let no one presume</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">to misinterpret him. It was not likely that a man of twenty-five should</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">fall in love with a girl of fourteen. Dotards do such things, not men.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Then it was utterly preposterous to suppose that Archer Clifton, of</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Clifton, Captain in the —— Regiment of Cavalry, the fastidious amateur</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">in female beauty, should be smitten with a hard-featured, sun-burned</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">girl, in a coarse, homespun frock, that the all-accomplished scholar</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">should be charmed with the little ignoramus; that the arrogant</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">conservative of rank should condescend to a low-born mountaineer; or</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">that the expectant bridegroom of the beautiful and haughty Carolyn</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Clifton, of Clifton, should wish to marry a girl who united all these</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">repulsive qualities of ignorance, ruggedness, and low birth. Yet if he</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">could have looked only two short years into the future!</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">But Clifton was a physiognomist, and liked to study a novel</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">individuality. A new and very curious subject was before him now. At</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">first he had seen in Kate nothing more than a coarse-featured,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">dark-skinned country girl. Now, as he sat and watched her at her quiet</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">work, with her countenance in the repose of thoughtfulness, he saw that</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">her features, though certainly not beautiful or classical, were even of</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">a higher order of physiognomy, combining the rarest elements of power</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">and goodness. The broad and massive forehead, straight nose, and square,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">firm jaws, were the strong and ugly features—the rugged frame work, as</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">it were, of her countenance, and indicated great force of character. But</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">her hair, eyes, and lips were beautiful. Her hair, of rich dark brown,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">with golden lights, rippled around her forehead, shading and softening</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">its stern strength. Her eyes, large and shadowy, with drooping lashes,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">and her lips sweetly curved, full, and pensively closed, suggested a</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">profound depth of tenderness. Indeed the brooding brow, the downcast</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">eyes, and the compressed lips seemed to be habitual with her, and gave</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">her countenance an expression of grief and care beyond her years, and of</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">thought and intellect above her station. As Clifton sat and studied her,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">he thought—not of</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2"><span class="Apple-converted-space">            </span>“Full many a flower that’s born to blush unseen,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2"><span class="Apple-converted-space">            </span>And waste its sweetness on the desert air,”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">for the girl did not resemble a flower so much as a hardy, pine sapling</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">of her native mountains. No; that look, strength, intellect, and</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">self-balance—in a word—that look of POWER, suggested rather—_girl_ as</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">she was—</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2"><span class="Apple-converted-space">            </span>“Some village Hampden with undaunted breast.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2"><span class="Apple-converted-space">              </span>*<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>*<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>*<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>*<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>*</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2"><span class="Apple-converted-space">            </span>Some mute inglorious Milton,<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>*<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>*<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>*</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2"><span class="Apple-converted-space">            </span>Some CROMWELL guiltless of his country’s blood.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">It _was_ a Maria Theresa face without the wickedness.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Captain Clifton’s physiognomical studies were interrupted by the abrupt</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">starting of Frank, who exclaimed vehemently—</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Beaten in four games! Now, that’s what I call outrageous! Don’t you</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">know, my dear fellow, that there are three persons in the world who</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">should never be beaten—a guest, a woman, and a monarch?”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Carl laughed and chuckled, and beating the draught-board tambourine-like</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">above his head in triumph, carried it off and put it away.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">The whole party then arose to retire. Carl took the candle and showed</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">his guests up into the loft and left them to repose.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Now where will that child sleep, for we have got her room?” asked</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Frank, with concern, as soon as they were alone.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Oh-h!” replied Captain Clifton, indifferently, “anywhere—on a</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">pallet—perhaps, down stairs.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“But the old man and the young one—”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Oh-h!” again drawled Clifton, in a bored tone, “if you expect to meet</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">with refinement among the mountain people, you will be disappointed.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Long after the travellers had laid down to rest, they heard the sound of</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">footsteps moving about in the room below. They moved quietly and</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">cautiously, as if fearful of disturbing the guests; but, as I said</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">before, all sounds, even the lowest, could be distinctly heard through</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">that shell of a house.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">On awaking the next morning, the young men found their own clothes well</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">cleaned, dried, and pressed, ready for them to put on.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Ah, ha!” said the sagacious Frank, “that is what the poor girl was at</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">work at so late last night.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">On going down stairs they found the lower room neatly arranged, and</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">breakfast ready for them—hot coffee, corn pone, hot rolls, rashers of</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">fried bacon, eggs, potatoes, etc. And there, in the arm-chair, in a</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">clean homespun suit, sat the old man, looking as calm, as</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">self-possessed, as noble and venerable as a Roman senator. He arose and</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">bowed to the gentlemen, and offered his chair to one of them.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">No wonder it bowed the young girl’s head with grief and shame—it pained</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">and humbled even these strangers, to know that this most reverend</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">white-haired patriarch was often transformed by drunkenness into the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">beast! It was a disease, Kate had often said, wringing her hands with</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">anguish, while seeing his degradation.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">It _was_ a disease, and never till vice is treated as such, will an</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">effectual remedy be applied.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Immediately after breakfast, the gentlemen took leave of the family, and</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">mounted their horses to pursue their journey. Frank, in the thoughtless</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">kindness of his heart, would have offered the poor people some</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">remuneration for their entertainment, but Clifton, who knew the habits</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">and feelings of the mountaineers better, arrested a purpose that might</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">have given offence. But on parting with Carl Kavanagh, Captain Clifton</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">expressed his thanks for the hospitality that had been extended to</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">himself and friend—adding, that if he could then, or at any time, in any</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">manner, be of use to his kind host, he should be happy to serve him,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">etc., etc. To this the young man replied—</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“I thank you, sir. I know Captain Clifton by report, and feel that I can</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">trust to his generosity. I have a heavy care—my young sister. If you</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">could hear of a place at service for her among the honorable ladies of</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">your family or acquaintance, I should feel very grateful indeed, sir.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Captain Clifton kindly gave his promise to make inquiries. Frank again</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">shook hands with Carl, bowed to Kate, nodded to the old man through the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">window, and then the travellers turned from the door of the mountain</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">hut, cantered briskly up the glen, and took the road to WHITE CLIFFS.</span></p>

<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">The torrents had been so terribly swollen and overflowed, and the roads</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">so dreadfully washed and guttered by the tempest and flood of the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">preceding evening, that the travellers found the greatest difficulty in</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">pursuing their journey, often having to turn back miles on this road to</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">take another way, and often being obliged to search leagues up and down</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">the course of a river, to find a practicable ford.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Therefore it was near night-fall when they crossed the last range of</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">forest-crowned mountains, and descended into the wooded valley that lay</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">between them and White Cliffs. A winding road through the woods brought</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">them to the house. The full moon was rising East of the cliffs, and</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">casting their shadow back across the house and lawn. The mansion was a</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">lofty edifice of white stone, with terraced roof, and many irregular,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">projecting wings. The tall trees surrounding the buildings, the lofty</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">cliffs rising behind them, the dark shadow falling on all; the hour, the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">silence, and the solitude, gave an air of refreshing coolness and deep</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">repose to the scene. On turning an angle of the building, they saw the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">drawing-room windows open, and the light from them gleaming out</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">cheerfully across that part of the lawn. At that moment a servant,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">waiting at the hall door, came down to take their horses.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“All well at home, Dandy?” inquired Captain Clifton, as he dismounted,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">and threw him the reins.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Sarvint, sir. All very well,” replied the man, touching his hat.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Captain Clifton led the way up into the hall adjoining the drawing-room,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">where they were met by an old gentleman, who seized both of Clifton’s</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">hands, and shook them slowly and cordially, as he said, dropping each</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">word separately, with a hearty, luscious emphasis—</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Why—my—dear—boy—how glad I am—to see you!”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“And I am very happy to be with you, sir; and to find you looking so</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">well. Allow me to introduce to your acquaintance—Lieutenant Fairfax, of</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">my company,” said Captain Clifton, presenting his friend.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Glad to see him! Glad to see Mr. Fairfax! Glad to welcome any friend of</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">my nephew’s to Clifton. How-do-you-do, sir? Knew your relative, Lord</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Fairfax, of Greenway Courthouse. Excessively fond of hunting. Kept</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">bachelor’s hall. Very great mistake, that—very! Hope you won’t follow</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">his example! Fine man, however, and I honor his memory! Come in, sir!</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">come in! Come in, Archy! My—dear—boy—I’m—so—del—_ighted_ to see you!”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Whenever he spoke to his nephew, he seemed to dwell upon each separate</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">syllable with a cordiality impossible to describe.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">He was a large, old gentleman, clothed in a fresh, fragrant suit of pale</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">blue linen, with his hair as white as cotton, his fresh, rosy</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">complexion, fine teeth, and clear, kind, blue eyes, making a most</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">refreshing picture of simplicity, cheerfulness, and cleanliness of soul</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">and body in old age. He was of a sanguine temperament, and under great</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">provocation, could get into a passion, too. And what old father of a</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">family, with two grown daughters, and a young wife, all under eighteen</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">years of age, and all beauties, has _not_ enough combustible material to</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">burn the house down, or set his own temper on fire?—yet such was the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">kindness of his heart, that even when in violent anger, stamping up and</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">down the floor, grasping desperately at his own white temple locks with</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">both hands, and vociferating in stentorian tones—it was all, as Frank</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">afterwards said, _shooting with blank cartridges_—he never said a word,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">or did a thing, to wound a single soul.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“I trust the ladies are all well, sir,” said Captain Clifton, as he</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">followed his uncle.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Yes—yes—that is to say, _Carry_ is well, but not well _pleased_. She</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">expected you yesterday—didn’t consider the storm any excuse for your</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">absence. Ah! you dog—you sad dog—at your age would _I_ have kept a lady</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">waiting? Nay, would I do it _now_? But come, shall I present you to the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">ladies now, or do you prefer first the refreshment of the bath and a</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">change of dress? Your own and your friend’s baggage arrived this morning</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">by the wagon, and has been conveyed to your rooms.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Oh, a change of dress, by all means!” suggested Frank.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Dandy—DANDY!” exclaimed the old gentleman, raising his strong voice,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">till the servant appeared, “show Mr. Fairfax to General Washington’s</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">room.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">General Washington had slept one night at Clifton, and from that time to</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">this, the room he occupied has been “General Washington’s room.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">The servant conducted Mr. Fairfax up stairs. And then the old gentleman,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">turning to his nephew, took his hands again, and said—</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“My dear boy, once more I must say, I’m—so—_glad_—to—see you! _You_ are</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">at home, you know. So go and find your room, and ring and give your</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">orders, _my son_, for you are so. And I will go and let the ladies know</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">that you have come, though I dare say they know it already.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">And shaking his hands, he let them go and turned slowly away.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Half an hour sufficed the young gentlemen to make themselves</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">presentable. At the end of which time they descended the stairs, and</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">were met in the hall by old Mr. Clifton, who ushered them into the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">drawing-room.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">This apartment was a most delightful summer room. It was very spacious,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">occupying the whole first floor of one of those irregular wings of the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">house. The ceiling was lofty, the walls were covered with pearl white</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">paper, and the floor of white oak was waxed and polished to an ivory</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">smoothness. On three sides were tall windows, reaching to the floor, and</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">opening out upon the piazza or the lawn, and draped with snowy, flowing</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">curtains. On the fourth side was the open fire-place, whitened inside,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">and having on its marble hearth an alabaster vase of lilies, whose</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">fragrance filled the air. The walls were adorned with tall mirrors, and</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">with choice paintings, all of a cool, refrigerating character, such as:</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">An Alpine Scene, A Green Forest Glade, with Deer Reposing, A Mountain</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Lake, A Shaded Pond, with Cows, A Farm Yard in a Snow Storm, etc. A</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">piano stood at the farthest end of the room. A harp reclined near it. A</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">few marble-topped stands and tables, scattered over with rare prints,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">books, _virtu_, _bijouterie_, etc., stood at convenient distances. A</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">lady’s elegant work-table, with its costly trifles, was a pleasing</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">feature in the room. Sofas, ottomans, divans, and lounging chairs,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“fitted to a wish for study or repose,” were everywhere at hand.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Through the open windows came the evening wind, laden with the fragrance</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">of flowers, the murmur of falling waters, the whisper of leaves, and the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">cheery chirp of insects—those night songsters who begin when the birds</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">go to sleep—nature’s vesper choir. While _from_ the open windows could</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">be darkly seen the tall shadowy trees, the towering white cliffs, and,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">in the distance, a bend of that great river which took its rise here,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">and which there sleeping among the dark green hills, with the moon</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">shining full upon it, seemed a resplendent mountain lake, flashing back</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">the moonbeams from its bosom in rays of dazzling light. The whole effect</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">of the room and the scene was delightfully cooling and refreshing.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">When Mr. Clifton conducted his guests into this saloon, it was occupied</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">by three young ladies, who, immediately on their entrance, arose to</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">receive them; and whom, in presenting his visitors, Mr. Clifton</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">severally named as, my wife, Mrs. Clifton,—my daughter, Miss Clifton,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">and my second daughter, Zuleime. Captain Clifton, in turn, saluted his</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">aunt and cousins. Miss Clifton, his betrothed, received him with cold</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">hauteur.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">So, these were the beauties—and beautiful, passing beautiful, they were</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">indeed, though differing from each other in beauty, as “one star differs</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">from another in glory.” But let me describe them.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Carolyn Clifton is tall and elegantly proportioned, and moves with</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">high-bred dignity. Her features are Grecian—her complexion is dazzlingly</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">fair, save when the pure rich blood mantles in her cheek, and crimsons</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">the short and scornful lip. Her eyes are blue, and half veiled by their</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">fair lashes, as in disdain of aught that might seek their glance. Her</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">fair hair is carried up from her forehead, and falls in bright</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">tendril-like curls around the back of her neck, lending an intellectual</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">and queenly grace to the proud head. The costume of that day closely</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">resembled the prevailing mode of our own. Miss Clifton wore a dress of</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">pale blue silk, made low in the neck, with a long-waisted stomacher,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">tight sleeves reaching to the elbows, and ample flowing skirt. The neck</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">was trimmed with a fall of deep lace, then called a “tucker,” and</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">answering to the present _berthè_. The tight half-sleeves were trimmed</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">at the elbows by deep lace ruffles, shading the arm. A necklace of large</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">strung pearls around her throat, a bracelet of the same on her arm, and</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">a pearl-headed pin run through the Grecian knot of ringlets at the back</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">of her head, completed her toilet. She carried in her hand and toyed</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">carelessly with a beautiful fan of marabout feathers. She was the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">daughter of the _first_ Mrs. Clifton, of Clifton, a fair, proud Maryland</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">lady, one of the haughty Gowers, who lived long enough to augment by</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">precept and example, the double portion of family arrogance Carolyn</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Clifton had inherited from both sides of her house. Miss Clifton had</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“received her education” at a first-class “Ladies’ Institute” at</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Richmond.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Zuleime, the younger sister, was about fourteen years of age, but well</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">grown and full-formed for her years. She was the daughter of the second</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Mrs. Clifton, a beautiful West Indian Creole, who died in giving her</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">life. She had the snowy skin and damask cheek of her father’s fair race,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">and the glittering black hair and sparkling black eyes of her Creole</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">mother. Her dress was of plain white muslin, with short sleeves and low</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">neck, and coral necklace, which well set off the exceeding brilliancy of</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">her complexion. Zuleime was home for the mid-summer holidays.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Mrs. Clifton, of Clifton, Georgia!</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Yes, she is indeed the most beautiful woman in the whole world,”</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">exclaimed Fairfax, to himself, as he turned from the fair and dignified</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Carolyn—the brilliant and sparkling Zuleime, to the dark and graceful</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Georgia. She is of medium height. Her complexion is a rich, dark,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">uniform olive, her very cheeks being of the same hue, but so</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">transparently clear, that that which would mar the perfection of another</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">face, adds deeper beauty to hers. Yes! the delicate bloom of the fair</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Carolyn, and the bright damask blush of the brilliant Zuleime, seem</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">common-place beside the perfect beauty of the pure, clear olive cheek of</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">the dark Georgia. Her hair is intensely black, with depths under depths</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">of darkness, lurking in the labyrinths of irregular curls that cluster</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">around, and throw so deep a shadow over her witching face. Her eyebrows</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">are black and arched. Her eyelashes are long, black, and drooping. Her</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">eyes are—pause—I have been trying to think of something to which her</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">wondrous eyes may be compared, for darkness, profundity and power.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Midnight? No, her eyes are darker, stiller, and more solemn yet. Thunder</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">clouds? No, for her eyes are more stormy and impending still—and their</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">electric stroke is silent as it is fatal. In short, her eyes resemble</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">nothing but themselves. Her dress is of black gauze, over black silk,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">made high to veil her neck, and finished with a narrow black lace,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">within which gleams around her throat a necklace of jet and gold. She</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">wears no other jewelry. A large black lace mantilla is carelessly thrown</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">over all. When she moves her every movement is undulating grace—her</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">motion might be set to music. And when she sits still she is _so_ still,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">and dark, and beautiful—_and something else, besides_, that the gazer</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">experiences something like the fascination and terror one feels in</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">looking down the depths of a dark chasm.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">She was the daughter of a portrait painter in Richmond, and this was</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">what Captain Archer Clifton, in his arrogance, called humble parentage.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Mr. Clifton had met her under the following circumstances: On finally</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">withdrawing his eldest daughter from school, he wished, before carrying</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">her home, to have her portrait taken, and went for that purpose to the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">studio of Mr. Fuller, portrait and miniature painter, where he chanced</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">to see her for the first time, the artist’s beautiful child, Georgia. He</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">took so strong a fancy to this bewitching creature, that he delayed his</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">departure—prolonging his stay in the city for three weeks, at the end of</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">which, besides the accomplished Miss Clifton, with her elegant wardrobe,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">splendid jewels, costly presents, and finished portrait—he took home the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">artist’s daughter as the fourth Mrs. Clifton, of Clifton much to the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">indignation of the haughty Carolyn, who never ceased to treat her</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">beautiful young stepmother with scorn and contempt.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Supper was announced, and the old gentleman, rising, requested his</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">nephew to lead in his wife, while he himself, took the arm of his eldest</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">daughter, and left Zuleime to Mr. Fairfax. They crossed the hall and</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">entered a large and pleasant dining-room, where stood an elegant table,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">laid with a damask table-cloth, set out with silver plate, and Sevres</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">porcelain, and laden “with all the luxuries of the season.” Waiters of</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">perfect dress and _ad_dress were in attendance.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“I assure you, Miss Zuleime, that contrast is all the seasoning of</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">existence—and _this_ is a high seasoning. For yesterday we sat down to</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">eat supper off of pewter plates, on a bare board, in a mean hut, in</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">company with rude mountaineers, and to-night we sit at the elegant</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">tea-table of Clifton, surrounded with beautiful, refined, and</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">accomplished ladies,” said Frank, as he handed his lively companion into</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">her chair, and took the seat by her side.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">The sprightly Zuleime laughed, and said she doubted whether he would</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">find more substantial or savory fare here than he got at the mountain</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">hut.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">After all were seated, and all served, the conversation became general</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">and vivacious—old Mr. Clifton being evidently “the life of the company.”</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">He chatted, jested, laughed, told anecdotes, and finally, inspired</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Frank, who gave a laughable description of their adventures on the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Alleghanies; of being upset in the stage coach, and pitched into Wolf’s</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Lick; of being lost in the fog, and near going down the Devil’s</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Staircase; finally, of being caught in the tempest, and shut up in a</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">mountain hut with a raving maniac. At this the old gentleman began to</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">rally his proud daughter on her gratuitous ill-humour of the preceding</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">evening, at the said delay, and then to scold the young men for their</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">effeminacy and want of gallantry, courage, in suffering themselves to be</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">deluged by the storm. Now, to be charged, all at once, with effeminacy,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">and want of gallantry, and courage, even in jest, was too much, and in</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Frank’s case, too near the truth to go without reply. So he began</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">vehemently to clear his fame, assuring the assembled company that it was</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">_not_ altogether effeminacy, for that they had been hospitably sheltered</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">in the cabin of a beautiful shepherdess.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Yes,” said Frank, maliciously, “_so_ beautiful that _Clifton_ there</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">couldn’t keep his eyes off her, and while I sat and played checkers with</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">her brother, he sat and studied her face, ‘and it were a book’—_for</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">hours_. I wish you had seen him, Miss Clifton—</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2"><span class="Apple-converted-space">                         </span>“‘Never gazed the moon</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2"><span class="Apple-converted-space">                   </span>Upon the water as he sat and read</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2"><span class="Apple-converted-space">                   </span>As ’twere her eyes.’</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Fact, my dear lady, and I should be guilty of misprision of treason, to</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">conceal it!” laughed Frank, shaking his head at his friend.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Ah-h-h! H-a-a-ah!—are you _there_, my fine fellow!” chuckled the old</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">gentleman, gleefully rubbing his hands, and pointing his finger at his</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">nephew, greatly enjoying his discomfiture.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“I assure you, sir,” began Captain Clifton, gravely.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Oh! don’t assure _me_! don’t assure _me_! Assure Carolyn! What d’ye</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">think o’ that, Carolyn? What d’ye think o’ that? More cause for</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">ill-humor last night, than ye thought, eh! What think o’ that?” he</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">continued, mercilessly.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">And Carolyn—</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2"><span class="Apple-converted-space">               </span>“Oh, what a deal of scorn looked beautiful</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2"><span class="Apple-converted-space">               </span>In the contempt and anger of her lip!”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">There are some women who cannot bear jest upon such subjects—who cannot</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">tolerate that their lovers should look with common curiosity—far less</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">gaze with interest or admiration “for hours,” upon any other young</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">female face. And such a woman was Carolyn Gower Clifton. Captain Clifton</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">knew this, and adoring her above all things, silently wished Frank and</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">the mountain-girl both at the bottom of the Devil’s Staircase.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">The old gentleman chatted and laughed; Frank jested and blundered; the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">sprightly Zuleime sparkled and overflowed with fun and frolic, and the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">meal went on merrily, notwithstanding.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">When supper was over they adjourned to the airy summer drawing-room,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">where they distributed themselves according to their several humors.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Miss Clifton passed imperiously down the room, and took her seat upon a</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">distant divan. Captain Clifton followed, with a troubled air, and sat</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">down on the low ottoman at her feet. They doubtless thought if they</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">thought at all—that they were in a very obscure nook. But Frank had the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">impertinence to see them. There sat the haughty and scornful girl, with</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">chin erect, lip curled, and eyelids cast down in disdain upon her</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">suppliant. And there sat Archer Clifton, with his high, proud face</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">turned up to hers, with an earnest, pleading, passionate gaze!</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Now, by the venom of Cupid’s shaft!” exclaimed Frank, to himself, “I</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">cannot see what Clifton finds to worship in that arrogant girl. If it</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">were this bright, warm Zuleime, here, now! But _her_! I might really</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">suspect _him_ of being a fortune-hunter, and _her_ of being an heiress,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">if I didn’t know that Archer Clifton is himself the heir of the entailed</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">estate of Clifton, and that if his uncle were to die to-night, he might,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">if he pleased, turn all these penniless women out of the house</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">to-morrow! Can’t understand it, for my life! But I suppose the bond of</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">sympathy between them is their name and their pride!”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Do you find talking to yourself a very amusing pastime, Mr. Fairfax,”</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">asked Zuleime, touching him on the elbow.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“No, my dear, delightful little girl, I don’t. What a delightful thing,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">in a country house, is a beautiful girl of fourteen, home for the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">holydays—a black-eyed, red-lipped girl, in a white muslin gown and a</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">coral necklace!”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Are your soliloquies as good natured as your conversation, Mr.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Fairfax,” inquired the laughing Zuleime.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Not quite, I’m afraid, my dear.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Do you know how to play chess, Mr. Fairfax?” she asked, opening the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">chess-board.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“I know how to play _anything_ you wish me to play, my love—even the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">fool!”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“_Oh!_ the latter is not so rare or difficult an accomplishment,”</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">laughed the maiden, taking her seat, and beginning to arrange the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">chess-men. Frank sat down, and they commenced the game in earnest.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">All this time the old gentleman, with his white head and rosy face, and</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">kind smile and glance, had been walking leisurely up and down the floor</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">slowly, rubbing his hands with an air of great enjoyment—pausing now by</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">the work-table at which sat his beautiful wife, and gazing on her fondly</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">while he toyed with the elegant trifles of her work-box—then sauntering</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">off towards the chess-table, and patting the head of his “little</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">black-headed darling”—as he called Zuleime—or passing a jest with Frank</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">as he overlooked the game—until the boy came from the post-office</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">somewhat late; when taking the paper he went and ensconced himself in an</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">easy-chair on the opposite side of his wife’s work-table, and was soon</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">busied in the perusal of the debate on Mr. Jefferson’s bill for cutting</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">off entails. Frank felt very much pleased that the old boy, as he</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">mentally called him, was quieted at last, and that he himself had at</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">length an opportunity of initiating his charming companion into the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">mysteries of flirtation, while she imparted to him the secrets of chess.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">The room was now very quiet. And Frank was soon deeply immersed in his</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">game. Yes—the room was very quiet, it seemed the sanctuary of domestic</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">love and happiness! At one extremity sat the betrothed lovers,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">conversing in a low tone, softer than the hum of far-off bees. At the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">other extremity sat the graceful young wife, placidly pursuing her quiet</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">work, and seeming more like the darling spoiled child of the old man,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">her husband, who sat reading by her side, and whose kind eyes often</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">wandered from the paper and rested fondly upon her. About midway of the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">room, sat Frank and his bright companion, too deeply interested in their</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">chess to notice the happy lovers, or to observe the quiet contentment of</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">the old man with his beautiful darling. Yes, this room seemed a temple</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">of domestic truth and trust—of family peace and joy. At least so thought</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Frank, until raising his eyes from his game, his glance chanced to fall</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">for an instant upon the face of Mrs. Clifton.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">It might have been the darkness of her surroundings, which threw into</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">such strong relief that fearful countenance, for the black dress and</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">flowing black mantilla veiled all her form, while the clustering deep</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">black curls darkly shaded her face. Her form was turned from the table</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">and bent over the arm of the chair—her bosom was heaving, her lips apart</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">and humid, her nostrils slightly distended, and her eyes, those dreadful</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">eyes, fixed with a passionate, fierce, devouring gaze upon some distant</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">object.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Frank impulsively followed the direction of that consuming gaze, to</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">where the betrothed lovers sat fully reconciled. Clifton, unconscious of</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">all eyes, but those blue orbs that smiled so graciously upon him, was</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">pressing Carolyn’s hand to his lips in an ecstacy of love and gratitude.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Frank turned again to Mrs. Clifton. Her countenance had changed as by</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">the passage of a thunder-cloud. Her bosom was still as death. Her brow</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">and cheek was darkened, her teeth and lips clenched together, her eyes</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">fixed upon the lovers with the baleful glare of a demon. If the head of</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">the fabled Medusa had suddenly met his astonished gaze, he could not</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">have felt a deeper thrill of horror. And yet it was only a look—the look</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">of an instant—it came and went like the swift swooping past of a fiend’s</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">wing—but the shadow on all things seemed to remain. No more did that</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">room seem the blessed retreat of household faith and love—no! a deadly</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">serpent lay coiled among its flowers—a deadly poison lurked in its cup</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">of joy—the shadow of a demon’s wing was brooding in the air—the house</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">was CURSED!</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Frank was of a highly honorable nature, but nervous and impressible—he</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">could no longer confine his attention to the game; he misplayed</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">awkwardly—ridiculously. Zuleime laughed at him—and her silver laughter</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">struck almost unpleasantly upon his ear. He lost the game, and finally,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">complimenting his young antagonist upon the excellence of her own</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">play—an excellence which he admitted he had not fully brought out—Frank</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">arose from the table and sauntered out into the piazza, exclaiming</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">inwardly—“Ugh! I believe in Satan, since I’ve seen that woman! Ugh!</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Whe-ew! Every time I think of her I shall feel hot and smell brimstone!”</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">I said that Frank was of an extremely impressible nature. He stood now</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">upon the piazza at the back of the house, and the majestic crescent of</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">cliffs was before him. The quiet of the night, the freshness of the dew,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">the coolness of the breeze, the beauty and sublimity of the mountains</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">rising from their girdle of forest, with their peaks bathed in</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">moonlight—the distant glimpse of the bend in the river, where it lay</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">like a silver lake among the hills—the divine peace and holiness of</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">nature fell soothingly, refreshingly upon his excited nerves. And after</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">sauntering up and down the piazza for some twenty minutes, he returned</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">to the parlor in a happier mood. There he found the family grouped</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">around the table on which sat a silver basket of pine-apples with</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">cut-glass plates, and silver fruit knives and napkins.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Come, Mr. Fairfax, my dear fellow, we are waiting for you,” said the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">old gentleman, beckoning him.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Frank joined them at the table, and after this repast was over, the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">family separated and retired to bed.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>

<p class="p3"><span class="s2"><span class="Apple-converted-space">                              </span>CHAPTER III.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2"><span class="Apple-converted-space">                     </span>MRS. CLIFTON, OF HARDBARGAIN.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>She is a lady of confirmed honor, of an unmatchable spirit, and</span></p>

<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Clifton by the morning sunlight! Oh! that I could show it to you as</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Fairfax saw it from the balcony of his chamber on the morning after his</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">arrival! The whole face of the country was very high, yet even this</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">elevated land was broken into hills and valleys, rocks and glens. Behind</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">the house arose the white cliffs so often mentioned, shutting out the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Northern view, but before the house lay the valley in which the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">plantation was situated, and around that, East, West and South,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">stretched a magnificent panorama, ridge beyond ridge of mountains,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">covered with gigantic forests, clothed with the richest verdure, rolling</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">on until they gradually faded away in the distance, their forms lost</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">among the clouds of the horizon. It seemed a vast, boundless ocean of</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">greenery, of which the vales and mountains were the stupendous waves,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">charmed to sleep.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">It was a magnificent solitude. Not a human dwelling to be seen. The</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">planters’ mansions—if there were any in the neighborhood, were low in</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">the vales, and hidden from sight. The mountain torrent, as it came</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">leaping down the side of the cliff, running through the wooded lawn,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">losing itself in the forest vale, and reappearing as a mountain lake</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">among the distant hills, was a beautiful feature in the landscape. The</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">deep intense blue of the clear skies, the early splendor of the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">sunlight, the murmur of the breeze among the waving trees, the joyous</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">songs of birds, gladdened all the scene, and put to flight Frank’s blue</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">devils, long before Dandy called him to breakfast.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">The breakfast-table was set in the lawn under the shadow of the pine</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">elms.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">The old gentleman, in his suit of cool white linen—the sisters in neat</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">morning dresses of white cambric, and the dark Georgia, in her usual</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">dress of black, were assembled on the piazza. They greeted Mr. Fairfax</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">with lively welcome, telling him that Clifton had not yet made his</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">appearance. But even while they spoke, Captain Clifton joined them, and</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">they sat down to breakfast. Those breakfasts on the lawn! How many times</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">in after years, in the sultry heat of the city hotel, did Fairfax recall</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">them!</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Soon after breakfast, Captain Clifton invited Mr. Fairfax to accompany</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">him in a ride up the ridge to his mother’s farm. And after taking leave</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">of the ladies they set out. They left the house by the back way, and</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">took a winding bridle-path up the side of the cliffs. The day was very</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">fine and cool, and their path was shaded by overhanging trees. It was</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">altogether a delightful ride, and as they went up, Clifton, who led the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">way, turned his head around and inquired—</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Frank! what instigated you to romance so last night about our sojourn</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">at the mountain hut?”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Romance? I didn’t romance, except in saying that the girl was</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">beautiful. I said _that_ for your credit!”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Oh! I ought to be _exceedingly_ obliged to you!”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Yes—I think so, too—but what malicious Puck gave _you_ a love-weed, and</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">fooled you into sitting and studying that ugly little girl’s hard face</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">all the evening?”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“I did not think her ugly at all. She has a noble countenance. A _most_</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">noble countenance. One, of which an empress might be proud of!”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Ha, ha! Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha! _I_ saw nothing but a mountainous forehead,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">and a strong portcullis jaw! ‘Noble!’ Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha! I said you’d</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">taken the love-powder!”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Yet even you cannot find any but a _noble_ simile in speaking of her</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">‘ugly’ features!”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Ah! what will Miss Clifton think of this admiration?”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Sir, Miss Clifton has my deepest homage, and when she is my wife, she</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">will indulge no follies. But, Fairfax, you are absurd, and I beg you</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">will abandon this ridiculous conversation. You know that I have always</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">had a proclivity to the study of character. Nature made me something of</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">a physiognomist. And if there be any truth in my favorite science, that</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">mountain-girl’s face presented the most extraordinary combination of</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">power and goodness I have ever met with.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Oh! then you only studied the maiden as the botanist would study a new</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">plant, the geologist a new fossil, or the naturalist a strange animal?—”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">—“Or the astronomer a new STAR? Precisely, sir! Except that the human</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">being is the highest and most absorbing study of all!”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Really! really! this passes belief—the proud, fastidious Archer</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Clifton, to be smitten with an ugly mountain-girl!”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Frank! Nonsense—you really anger me. Listen, then, and I will tell you</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">why that child—for she is but a child—interested me so much. I saw in</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">her face the signs of wonderful force of character, as yet undeveloped,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">and I saw in all her actions that which corroborated their testimony. I</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">was surprised to find all that in the humble mountaineer, and speculated</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">as to what, in her _very_ humble situation, it might lead. That was</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">simply all!”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“And did you not wish to be a providence to the mountain girl, and open</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">a field for so much energy?”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Perhaps such a thought might have presented itself to my mind. If so,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">it was dismissed at once. A highly gifted _man_ of low birth must have</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">extraordinary talents indeed, and be placed in extraordinary</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">circumstances, to elevate himself above his condition—for a _girl_ in</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">such a case it is impossible. But, Fairfax, really this conversation has</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">taken a more serious tone than I designed it should. Really, nobility of</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">character, though very rare among the lower classes of society, is yet</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">not so impossible as to excite our wonder. There are others like Kate</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Kavanagh—”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">—“How pat you’ve got her name! Now _I_ had forgotten it!”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Pooh! I say there are others like her. They are born great—they live</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">and die, and the world hears nothing of them. And talents that might</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">have swayed the counsels of a monarch, and decided the destinies of an</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">empire, have been employed to direct the household of a shepherd, and</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">determine the fate of a sheep! Such is the order of society, and better,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">far better so, than that its boundaries should be thrown down, its ranks</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">intermingled!”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“There spoke a Clifton of Clifton!” said Frank.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">They were now at the top of the ridge, and entering upon a hard, stony,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">half-reclaimed farm, in the midst of which stood a rude, but substantial</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">house, built of hewn rocks of every shade of gray, and surrounded by</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">trees. Below them, all around, rose the forest-crowned hills; behind</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">them the white cliffs concealed the mansion of Clifton from their sight,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">all around them lay fields of stunted corn.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“This is Hardbargain,” said Captain Clifton, opening a rude farm gate,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">and holding it open, while his companion passed through.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Hardbargain! a most appropriate name! I should think it the hardest of</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">all bargains, to receive this farm as a precious gift,” replied Frank,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">looking around upon the stony field and stunted corn.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Yes,” admitted Captain Clifton, “it is a well-merited title. It was</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">once called Rocky Ridge. A poor man got a grant of it, and settled there</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">first—spent all his health and strength in trying to bring the rugged</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">soil under cultivation—failed—christened the place Hard_scrabble_, and</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">sold it to my grandfather for thrice its value. My grandfather repented</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">the purchase, re-christened the ill-starred farm Hard_bargain_, and, as</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">the Clifton estate was entailed upon his eldest son, gave this farm as a</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">portion to his younger son, my father. My father was then a subaltern</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">officer in the Continental Army, and absent with Washington, at Valley</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Forge. My mother, with myself, then an infant, was a temporary sojourner</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">at Clifton. No sooner had my grandfather made a gift to my father of</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">this nearly barren farm, than my mother set all her faculties at work</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">for its cultivation and improvement. My mother was nearly penniless,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">being the daughter of a family of decayed fortune. My father was unable</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">to send her anything except the Continental notes, with which he himself</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">was paid, but which would scarcely pass farther. But being determined</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">not to eat the bread of dependence by remaining at Clifton after my</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">grandfather’s death, my mother sold all her jewelry and plate, which had</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">been left her by a deceased maiden aunt, and applied the proceeds of the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">sale to the improvement of Hardbargain. She hired laborers. There was a</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">rude log hut, built by the first settler upon the land. She hired a</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">woman, and placed her in that hut to keep house and cook for them. She</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">read books on agriculture, and consulted my uncle’s overseer upon the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">same subject. And every morning she rode up and spent the day at</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Hardbargain, overlooking the laborers. She was her own overseer! Frank!</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">you appreciate high worth when you see it. I may, besides, tell you</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">anything—you are my only companion—I tell you that my dear mother was</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">one in ten thousand. She was a true heroine, a heroine of domestic life.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Abandoning all her habits of elegance and refinement, despising luxury,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">ease and comfort, disdaining the sneers of the world, and giving herself</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">to toil and hardship, and weariness of body and mind, that she might win</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">from the desert an independent home for her family! My dear mother had</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">no reason to suppose, and never admitted the possibility that my uncle</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">would not be blessed with a male heir, that _I_, her son, for whom she</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">toiled to secure a rugged farm, would be the inheritor of entailed</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Clifton! And so she toiled, year after year, until at the end of the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">war, when the army was reduced, and my father came home, he found a</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">comfortable house, and a productive farm.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Clifton seemed to have fallen into one of his fits of reminiscence;</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">scarcely conscious that he was talking to his true but volatile friend,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">scarcely conscious that he was talking _at all_, he went on—</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“My first recollection of my dearest mother, is of a very noble looking</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">lady, of dark complexion, black hair, and gray eyes. I recollect, when</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">an infant of four years old, being brought out from the mansion-house of</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Clifton every morning, to the back road gate, where she sat upon her</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">horse awaiting me, with a little basket, containing our dinner, hanging</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">on the horn of the saddle. I used to be lifted to the saddle before her,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">and while her left arm encircled me, with her right hand she would guide</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">her horse around the base of the cliff, and take the winding bridle-path</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">that led up the Rocky Ridge, upon which lay her sterile farm of</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Hardbargain. Oh! I remember how she used to ride from field to field,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">making investigations, and giving directions to her rude workmen—and</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">with what deference the rough men were used to address her—hat in hand.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">I remember, too, our cold dinners, taken under the shade of an elm tree,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">whose lowest branches sheltered a fine spring—the head waters of that</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">very torrent, which, in course of time and space, swells into the mighty</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">river I told you of. Oh! my noble mother! how few would have displayed</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">her courage and fortitude!—not one in a million but would have rather</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">sat down in the luxurious ease and abundance of Clifton, where she had a</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">long welcome for as long as she should choose to stay—rather than have</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">dared the toil and hardship that she endured. The land was at last</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">cleared up, the farm laid off in order, and brought under the best</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">possible cultivation. A comfortable house was built, and my mother moved</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">into it to receive my father when he should come home, at the disbanding</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">of his company. He came at last—it was a happy time—and well I remember</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">how my mother’s young, but stern and weather-beaten face, bloomed and</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">softened again into youth and beauty and womanhood, by her soldier’s</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">side. But, ah! he had survived all the horrible perils and sufferings by</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">cold, hunger, and the foe, endured by our army during that long and</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">terrible struggle, and returned safe, to die in a time of peace—to die</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">at home, where every care and comfort surrounded him. Yes, he came home</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">in the winter of —82. Towards the spring, he took a slight cold—it was</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">neglected as of little account—it settled upon his lungs—before winter</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">came again, he died, and the first snow that fell, fell upon his grave.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">My honored mother was a strong-minded woman. After what I have told you,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">you know that she was! She loved him as only the strong can love. She</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">suffered as only the strong can suffer. She rose above that death-blow</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">to her happiness as only the strong can rise. But she has never been the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">same woman since. When a few years had passed, and her son’s welfare</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">demanded her care, she aroused every faculty of her mind and body, for</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">the ‘purpose of insuring’ his greatest good. Even at that epoch of time,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">there was no reason to suppose that I should inherit the Clifton estate.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">My uncle was then in the prime of manhood, had married his second wife,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">and by no means despaired of male issue. My dear mother taxed soul, body</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">and estate to the utmost, to defray my expenses at college, during the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">seven years of my residence there. It was also to her persevering</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">exertions, as well as to the late military services of my deceased</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">father, that I owed my commission in the army. They say that</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">_misfortunes_ never come single. _Good fortune_ certainly ne’er does, if</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">I may judge of our own experience of both. When I had left college, the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">heaviest tax was raised from our income, and when I obtained a</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">commission in the army, my year’s pay more than doubled the annual</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">income from the proceeds of the farm. At this time also my mother</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">received a legacy from an aged and distant relative, which enabled her</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">to stock her farm well, and furnish her house comfortably. Furthermore,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">my uncle having lost his _third_ wife, and at last given up all thoughts</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">of a son of his own, began to take quite a paternal interest in</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">me—insisting, when off duty, I should spend all my time with him—and</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">finding neither myself nor my mother disposed to forego each other’s</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">society, would have persuaded the latter to take up her abode under his</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">roof. But that arrangement did not suit my mother. She, who in her young</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">womanhood had too high a spirit for dependence—preferring to give</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">herself to severest toil and privation, rather than live in easy luxury</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">under another’s roof—could not in her stern maturity be bribed to give</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">up her well-earned independence. Nor indeed, under any circumstances,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">should I have consented to the plan. We compromised the matter by my</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">agreeing to spend half the time of furlough at Clifton. This was the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">more congenial to my feelings, as my cousin Carolyn had now left school</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">permanently. As for my uncle, he consoled himself for his disappointment</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">in not getting my mother’s society at Clifton, by marrying a fourth</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">wife.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“I am impressed with the idea that your mother is a very proud woman,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Clifton!” said Frank, taking advantage of Captain Clifton’s first</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">thoughtful pause.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“No, no,” he answered, slowly, as in half reverie, “no—she is not what</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">the world calls proud—she is no conservator of rank, as I am. She is the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">only _true_ republican I know in this whole Republic. Sprung, herself,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">from an ancient, noble, and haughty race, she yet honors talent and</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">virtue, when met with in the lowest ranks, as much—nay, I verily</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">believe, _more_, than when found in the highest circles, where it is</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">natural they should be more frequently seen.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">——“But here we are, and you shall judge for yourself,” concluded Captain</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Clifton, as he opened a gate admitting them into a shady yard, in the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">midst of which stood the house. They alighted at the gate and gave their</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">horses into the charge of a negro boy, and walked on to the house. It</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">was a plain oblong stone building, of two stories, with a deep, shady</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">piazza, running the whole length of the front. It was divided through</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">the centre by a wide passage way, the front and back doors of which were</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">both open and drawing a fine draft of air, and from which opened four</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">large airy rooms, two on a side. They stepped up on the piazza, and were</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">met at the front door by a neatly clothed negro girl, who admitted them</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">into the passage, and opening a door on the right hand next the front,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">showed them into a cool, breezy, but plainly furnished parlor; the walls</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">and ceiling being simply white-washed, and the floor bare but highly</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">polished with wax, as was the summer custom of the country at that day.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">The fire-place was open and filled with green bushes. The</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">window-curtains, and the lounge, and easy-chair covers, were all of</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">chintz. There was a reality of substantial and permanent comfort about</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">the place, that Frank thought he had never seen elsewhere. And when</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Clifton invited him to be seated, and he rested himself in one of those</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">cool arm-chairs in that shaded room, he declared that a feeling of</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">at-home-ativeness came over him, such as he had never experienced since</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">he left his own mother’s house, and never hoped to feel again until he</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">should have a house of his own. The negro girl whom Clifton addressed as</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Hennie, then left the room to summon her mistress, and shortly after the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">lady of the house entered.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Mrs. Clifton, of Hardbargain, was now about fifty years of age—tall, and</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">inclining to _en bon point_, but not more so than well became her years.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Her complexion was dark, and her hair and eyes black. Her features were</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">strongly marked and commanding, indicative of great strength of will and</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">indomitable firmness of purpose, all moderated, however, by the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">expression of her countenance, which was at once composed and gracious.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Her manner was marked by unaffected dignity and courtesy—her dress was</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">of very plain dark silk, made high to the throat, and with sleeves</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">coming down to the wrists, a small ruff set closely around her neck,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">fastened with a mourning pin. Her only head-dress was her own black</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">hair, which, though slightly mingled with gray, was worn uncovered.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Indeed, cap or turban upon that noble head would have looked</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">impertinent. She advanced into the room and greeted her son with</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">affection, and welcomed Mr. Fairfax with courtesy, though her words were</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">so few, and her manner was so calm, as to seem cool. Frank thought her a</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">very noble looking woman, though somewhat stiff and cold. Indeed, all</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">strangers, and superficial observers, thought her cold and proud. Never</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">was a greater misapprehension of character—never did a larger or more</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">generous heart live in the bosom of woman—albeit, its pulsations were of</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">the calmest and most regular character. She sat down and entered into an</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">easy conversation with her son and his friend, inquiring into the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">particulars of their journey, and making comments as they were related.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Once during the recital her cheek almost imperceptibly changed. It was</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">at the telling of the hair-breadth escape at the brink of the Devil’s</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Staircase, but upon that she made no observation whatever. She rang a</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">little hand bell, which was answered by the entrance of Hennie. She took</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">a bunch of keys from her pocket, and giving them to the girl, directed</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">her to bring refreshments. Hennie left the room, but soon returned</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">bearing a large waiter with home-made wine, cake, and a basket of fine</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">peaches and pears. While they regaled themselves upon these luxuries,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">she inquired after the health and well-being of the family of White</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Cliffs, and having received satisfactory answers, turned to Mr. Fairfax</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">and hoped that he was sufficiently well pleased with their neighborhood</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">to favor it with a long sojourn. Frank assured her that he should never</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">grow weary of the delights of his visit, and should conclude it only</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">when compelled to do so, and _then_ with great regret. The conversation</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">then became of more general interest. The weather, the condition of the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">roads, the health of the neighborhood, &amp;c., were discussed. And then the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">discourse took a higher tone, and the agricultural and political</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">condition and prospects of the whole country, and the great probability</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">of another speedy war with Great Britain, were debated. And Mr. Fairfax</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">wondered at the extent of information, the strong grasp of mind, and the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">depth and justness of thought, displayed by this recluse lady upon</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">subjects apparently so foreign to her daily experience.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">They made quite a long morning visit, and before their departure,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Captain Clifton took an opportunity—while Mr. Fairfax was walking around</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">the room and staring at some old family pictures, among which hung a</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">portrait by ——, of Oliver Cromwell, as Lord Protector of England—to draw</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">his mother aside, and say to her—</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Madam, I have a proposition to make to you, or a favor to ask—as it may</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">turn out.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“What is it, my son?” gravely inquired the lady.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“You heard Mr. Fairfax speak of the young mountain-girl whom we met just</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">before the storm, and who kindly conducted us to her grandfather’s</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">cabin?”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Yes.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“It is of her that I would speak, and for her that I would enlist your</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">sympathy and protection—”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Go on, I attend, my son.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“You have given me some credit for insight into character. If my</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">judgment is worthy of your consideration, this young girl is deserving</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">of your kindest offices.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Does she deserve them?”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Madam, she impressed me as being a child of high moral and mental</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">endowments, and the trying experience of one night proved the truth of</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">that impression.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Does she need my good offices?”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Mother! with the finest intellectual capacities, she is nearly</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">destitute of all opportunities of intellectual culture. That is bad—but</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">not so deplorable as what follows. Kate Kavanagh—that is her name—is far</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">removed from all of her own sex. Her young brother, her only protector,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">is absent from home from earliest dawn till late at night. Her only</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">companion is an old man, an habitual drunkard, subject to frequent and</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">furious fits of _mania-a-potu_. Her case, upon my showing, may not be so</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">exigent. But if you had seen her as I did, it would seem so. Her brother</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">being best acquainted with the circumstances, is the best judge in the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">premises, and is very anxious upon his sister’s account, and wishes to</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">get her a place at service.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“But if she is a girl of so excellent a nature as you have supposed,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">will she leave her aged relative?”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Not willingly, certainly—but—I wish the opportunity of improving her</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">condition afforded her, indeed, I promised her brother Carl that it</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">should be presented.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“I know Carl Kavanagh—he worked for me during the last year. I formed a</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">good opinion of him. If his sister is equal to him she must be a</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">meritorious girl.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“She is very superior to him, madam.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">The lady was mistress of great promptitude and decision of action. With</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">her eyes fixed upon the ground she reflected for a few moments, then</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">lifting them, said—</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Write to your friend Carl Kavanagh—”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Not my _friend_, dear madam, an’ it please you!” haughtily interrupted</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">her son.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">A slight shade of disapproval or of displeasure clouded the lady’s brow</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">for a moment, and she said—</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Write then to your dependent, Carl Kavanagh, and let him know that I am</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">willing to receive his sister into my own service on trial—and that he</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">may bring her hither as soon as is convenient.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Thank you, dearest madam, I will write to-day, and send a messenger</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">with the letter. I am really pleased and grateful for this kindness,”</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">said Archer Clifton, pressing his lips to the cheek she offered to his</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">salute.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">The young men soon after took leave, being engaged to dine that day at</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">home at White Cliffs.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Clifton!” said Mr. Fairfax, as they rode along, “excuse me for telling</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">you freely how highly I honor your mother. Yes! you may stare! _I_—the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">irreverent—the rash said—_excuse_ me for telling you how highly I honor</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">your mother—for, by my faith, she is a lady whom to praise is</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">presumption! But, my dear Clifton, how is it that she resembles so</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">closely that old portrait of Oliver Cromwell, which hangs, besides,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">between two family portraits. It is not possible you claim descent from</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">_him_?”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“My mother does, by the female line. I do not think I have much of his</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">nature. In his time I should have been a royalist. My mother venerates</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">his character very highly.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“By my soul! she is like him enough in feature.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Yes, and in many points of character, she is strikingly like him.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">In conversation such as this the friends reached White Cliffs, and Mr.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Fairfax retired to his chamber to dress for dinner, and Captain Clifton</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">entered the library for the purpose of writing a letter to Carl</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Kavanagh.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>

<p class="p3"><span class="s2"><span class="Apple-converted-space">                              </span>CHAPTER IV.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2"><span class="Apple-converted-space">                           </span>THE TIDE OF FATE.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2"><span class="Apple-converted-space">      </span>There is a tide in the affairs of man,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2"><span class="Apple-converted-space">      </span>Which, taken at the flood, leads on to fortune.—SHAKSPEARE.</span></p>

<p class="p3"><span class="s2"><span class="Apple-converted-space">       </span>Which, taken at the flood, leads—” God knows where.—BYRON.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Captain Clifton had written to Carl Kavanagh, informing him of the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">situation he had procured for the sister of the latter, at Hardbargain.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">And within this letter he had inclosed a longer one, to Kate, filled</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">with good counsels and urgent reasons why she should yield to the wishes</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">of her brother, and accept the place offered to her. After having</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">dispatched these letters by a boy, who left White Cliffs that afternoon,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">on horseback, he delivered himself up to the delights of Miss Clifton’s</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">society, forgetting all about the mountain-girl, until the next day,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">when, being seated in the library, his messenger returned, entered his</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">presence, and handed him a packet. It was a letter from Carl Kavanagh,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">enclosing one from Kate. He read Carl’s epistle first. It began by</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">expressing much gratitude to his benefactor, for his kindness in having</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">procured a situation for his sister, and went on by expressing much</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">sorrow that he could not prevail upon Kate, either by entreaties or</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">threats, to accept it, and unbounded indignation at what he called the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">girl’s wicked stubbornness. The letter closed by reiterating the thanks</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">of the writer. Captain Clifton held the letter open in his hand, and</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">lifting his head, fell into deep thought. It was strange how much this</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">little matter depressed him. Account for it, any philosopher that can.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Some proud people have a proclivity to patronage—Captain Clifton was</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">very proud, and perhaps he was piqued at being prevented playing the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">patron. Perhaps it was really disappointed benevolence. Only it is</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">certain that Archer Clifton did not possess that quality to an</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">immoderate degree—and having once done his duty of charity, would be</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">likely to content himself with any result. Perchance he felt a deeper</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">interest in the rugged little mountaineer than he would have</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">acknowledged, even to himself. Perhaps it was prescience—the shadow of</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">coming events. Be that as it may, Archer Clifton walked up and down the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">floor in silent thought, occasionally broken by a slight sigh. It was</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">wonderful how much the knowledge that he should not have this child at</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">home in his mother’s house vexed his soul.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">At length he recollected Kate’s own letter, yet unopened. But of what</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">avail to read it! It would certainly be the counterpart of Carl’s. He</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">opened it. It was not, however. In the first place, the paper was</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">perfectly clean; and in the second, the writing, spelling, and style,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">were rather better. She acknowledged the goodness of Captain Clifton, in</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">taking thought of her humble wants—expressed regret that she could not</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">avail herself of his kindness—could not leave her grandfather, who</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">needed her services, and subscribed herself Captain Clifton’s obliged</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">and grateful servant. It _was_ very much like Carl’s, after all. But</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">here is a postscript. What more can she have to say, after what she has</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">said, thought Clifton, as he turned to it. It read thus—</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“P. S.—I hope Captain Clifton will pardon me, if he thinks that I am</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>doing wrong—but it has come into my head, that as Captain Clifton is</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>about to marry, and reside in future at White Cliffs—and as Mrs.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Clifton of Hardbargain, will then be quite alone—and as she is not so</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>young, or active, or able to ride about her plantation, overseeing her</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>field hands as formerly—perhaps she will be thinking of getting a</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>farm-manager—if so, will Captain Clifton kindly remember my brother</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Carl, and speak a favorable word for him to the lady of Hardbargain,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>who already knows and trusts him? If Carl gets a situation as</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>overseer, I can keep house for him, and we can both take care of our</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>grandfather. Indeed I am afraid Captain Clifton will be justly angry</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>with me for this liberty.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“What a letter!” exclaimed Archer Clifton, as his face alternately</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">lighted up with satisfaction, or became clouded with thought. “What a</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">letter for a rustic girl of fourteen! Yet characteristic of _her_ and of</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">her situation. Showing the germs of reflection, forethought, courage and</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">promptitude, the gifts of nature, mingled with that frankness bordering</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">upon presumption, which belongs to total ignorance of the world. To dare</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">to speak familiarly of our domestic affairs! But yet how naïvely she</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">deprecates my displeasure, at what she feels may be received as</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">presumption.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">So deeply did Captain Clifton study Kate and her letter; Kate’s</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">remarkable countenance, with its breadth of brow and gentleness of eyes,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">haunted him.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">He was a man of prompt decision and action—so, having once admitted the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">idea that his mother needed an overseer, he exclaimed—</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Yes, my mother must be relieved from her arduous occupation—unbefitting</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">a lady of her rank, and especially of her age. Why could I not think of</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">that before? Why should I never have seen the necessity, until Catherine</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">held it up before me? Yes—my mother must have a manager on her farm, and</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Carl Kavanagh shall be the man. I will pay his salary myself.” And he</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">rung the bell, ordered his horse, and in less than fifteen minutes was</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">on his way to Hardbargain.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">As he rode up to the house, he met a girl with a pail on her head, going</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">to the spring, and inquired of her where her mistress was to be found.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">He was told, “down in the wheat field.” So, turning his horse’s head a</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">little to the left of the house, he rode down the slope of the hill, to</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">a wide harvest field, where he found Mrs. Clifton, seated on her mule,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">superintending the operations of some fifteen or twenty laborers, who</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">were employed in stacking wheat. He rode up to his mother’s side,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">alighted, and held out his hand, saying—</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“How-do-you-do, to-day, madam? Busily engaged as ever, I see, mother.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“How-do-you-do, Archer? Yes, very busy.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">While Captain Clifton was revolving in his mind the best way of</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">introducing the object of his visit, which he had reason to believe</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">would be distasteful to the energetic, independent lady—she quite</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">unconsciously anticipated his intention, and relieved him from his</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">embarrassment, by saying—</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“The heat is extremely oppressive, and I begin to find this business too</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">much for me, Archer. This continuing out in the fields day after day,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">and all day long, throughout this burning weather, begins to tell, even</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">upon my constitution.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Archer Clifton looked at his mother and noticed for the first time a</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">slight but certain change in her countenance, invisible, perhaps, to an</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">indifferent glance, but seeming to the eye of affection, fearfully like</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">the very earliest premonitory symptoms of decay. That look pierced him</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">to the heart. The fainter sound of her voice, too, had vaguely suggested</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">failing strength—it fell upon his ear like a prophecy, a warning, a</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">knell. He realized then, for the first time, that his mother was</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">mortal—was growing old—that some day he should lose her. He felt then,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">for the first time, how much _he_—a man—had rested on this good</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">mother—and his heart was troubled within him. And yet it was all caused</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">only by a transient weariness in the look of her face, and a faintness</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">in the tone of her voice. But more than all things else on earth—more</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">_deeply_—though less ardently—than his own fair expectant bride—did</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Archer Clifton love his mother! It had even been said, some years</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">before, by one who knew him best, that Clifton could never love any</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">woman with the full force of his nature unless in qualities of mind and</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">heart she resembled his mother. But of course, Captain Clifton had</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">disproved that prophecy by adoring his cousin, the haughty and beautiful</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Miss Clifton. This is a digression—to return—</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">As the new pang of fear for his mother’s health sped through his heart,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Archer Clifton took her hand—he had a singularly sweet and persuasive</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">voice and manner, when moved by his affections, and said—</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“There is no necessity for it, dear mother. Surely, the motive that</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">prompted you when I was a lad, and when this farm was our only prospect,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">has long ceased to operate.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“I know it, Archer. For some years past this personal superintendence of</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">the fields has been more a matter of habit, than a matter of necessity.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">If I could find a good manager I might try one.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“What do you think of Carl Kavanagh in that capacity, mother?”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Carl! I never thought of him at all. He has never managed a</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">plantation.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“But yet he has been a farm laborer many years—has a practical knowledge</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">of agriculture, and is, besides, a man of more intelligence than is</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">usually to be found in his class.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Yes—he is,” said the lady, thoughtfully.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“He is also a man of excellent moral character, and faultless</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">habits—qualities not too frequently met with among those of his grade.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“True—most true—but yet he is young, and has had no experience in</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">overseeing.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“And never will have, dear madam, unless some one gives him the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">opportunity of making the trial. And as for his youth, mother—why his</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">youth is positively an advantage—for with his practical knowledge,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">intelligence and honesty, he will be free from the conceit and crotchets</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">of an old manager, and will the more readily fall into your system.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“There is something in that,” said the lady. “And now, Archer, you will</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">remain and dine with me to-day. And remember, that when this week is</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">out, the next week belongs to me. You must bring your friend with you</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">when you come. Where did you leave him?”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Playing battledore with Zuleime. But, dear mother, about this Carl</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Kavanagh—I hope you will consider the plan favorably, and try him.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“I will think of it, Archer, because you propose it, if for no other</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">reason. And now the horn is blowing for the hands to go to dinner, and</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">my task for the day is relieved. Let us return to the house.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">They turned their animals’ heads, and rode up the ascent, and entered</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">the shady yard. Then the lady alighted from her mule, gathered up her</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">riding skirt, and leaning on the arm of her son, entered the house. A</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">plain but substantial dinner was soon served. Archer Clifton enjoyed his</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">mother’s plain meals more than the most luxurious dinners—not but that</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">he had a taste for luxury—what man has not?—but that there was a home</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">comfort about his mother’s table, that gave him appetite and spirit. And</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">then, after dinner, he could go and stretch himself upon the best lounge</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">in that large, shady, breezy parlor, with a book, and read or doze until</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">she had attended to the putting away of her things, and had locked up</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">her pantries. Then she would come and sit in the rocking-chair by his</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">side, while he could stretch himself at ease, in any ungainly attitude</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">he pleased, and feel what a refreshing thing it was to throw off his</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">dignity in the presence of the only one with whom he could do so—his own</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">familiar mother. Not but that he honored—nay, _revered_ her—but that he</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">enjoyed only in her house, that deep, full sense of home freedom, which</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">not only her son—but to a certain degree all others felt, who possessed</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">the privilege of the lady’s friendship.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">This afternoon, then, he was lying at his ease on the cool lounge</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">between the two front windows, which were drawing strong drafts of air,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">and flapping the festooned curtains lazily. He had thrown himself out at</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">full length upon the lounge, in the most delightfully _degagè_ attitude,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">albeit it was somewhat angular and awkward—his head being thrown back</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">over the end of the lounge, his hands clasped above his forehead, and</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">his elbows very prominent, one foot, minus a slipper, hoisted upon the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">window-sill, and the other slippered foot dangling on the carpet. But</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">the picturesque beauty of his dark, handsome face, atoned for all the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">rest. His mother sat in an easy-chair near him, with her feet upon a</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">footstool, and a work-stand by her side. She was engaged in stitching</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">wristbands—for that vigorous woman never required a lounge in the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">day-time—but though she never took one, yet she never blamed the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">indulgence of that habit in others for which she herself felt no</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">inclination. She was the most liberal and benevolent of all human</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">beings, in every act of her daily life. She was happy in seeing others</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">comfortable around her. She was ever pleased to see them enjoying those</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">relaxations which her own strong nature did not need. Indeed, courage</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">without asperity, fortitude without indurancy, strength without</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">hardness, self-denial without sternness, power without arrogance, formed</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">the peculiar excellence of her character. No wonder that her son revered</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">her. No wonder it had been said of him, that he never could love a woman</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">with all the power of his nature, unless in mental and moral</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">endowments—she resembled his mother. As they talked together this</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">afternoon, the hours slipped away till late in the evening, before the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">image of the beautiful Carolyn had power to draw him from the _tête à</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">tête_. During the afternoon he had prevailed with his mother to receive</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Carl Kavanagh as her overseer—and to have the comfortable log cabin</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">which had been occupied by the first proprietor of the soil, prepared</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">for the reception of the family.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">When Archer Clifton at length arose to take his leave, he pressed his</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">mother to his heart with so much fondness and power, that the quiet,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">calm lady laughed, a little, low, jolly laugh, and jested about</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Carolyn’s jealousy—even of his mother.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2"><span class="Apple-converted-space">                  </span>* <span class="Apple-converted-space">      </span>* <span class="Apple-converted-space">      </span>* <span class="Apple-converted-space">      </span>* <span class="Apple-converted-space">      </span>*</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Captain Clifton returned to White Cliffs, and gave himself up for the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">rest of the evening, to the charms of Carolyn’s conversation.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">The next day was one of festivity. Mrs. Clifton, of Hardbargain, came</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">over to dine at White Cliffs, and to meet a large party of the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">neighboring gentry. The day after that, the whole party dined and spent</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">the evening at Hardbargain—and this was the commencement of a series of</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">neighborhood entertainments in honor of the approaching marriage, which</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">were kept up for several weeks. The wedding was to come off in the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">course of a month—the present delay being owing to this circumstance:</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">old Mr. Clifton had sent to England, by the good ship Rockbridge,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Captain Cater, an extensive order, including a splendid outfit for the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">bride; and they were now awaiting to hear of the arrival of the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Rockbridge at Norfolk. In all the excitement of social enjoyment,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Captain Clifton had found time to ride to the mountain hut, and arrange</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">with Carl Kavanagh to come and take the situation of overseer at</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Hardbargain. He agreed to pay the latter a liberal salary, and to</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">provide a comfortable house for his family. One thing surprised and</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">annoyed him. Kate, who had written so freely, frankly, almost</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">presumptuously to him—received him with the old cold shyness and</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">reserve—not even expressing the least gratitude for the kindness he had</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">shown in getting the situation for her brother, or the trouble he had</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">condescended to take in coming personally to inform them of it. He</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">agreed with Carl, that the latter, with his grandfather and sister,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">should remove to Hardbargain in the course of the week—and on his own</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">part he promised to have the log-house prepared for their reception. He</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">shook hands with the old man and Carl on parting, but when he offered</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">the same civility to Kate, she turned pale and trembled, and when he</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">took her hand he found it cold.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“I do not think you are well, my dear girl—your mountain air does not</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">engender chills, does it?” he asked, pressing the cold fingers.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">She raised her eyes one brief instant to his, and dropped them quickly</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">again, while her pale check and brow became suffused with crimson, and</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">her hand that he held in his own throbbed like a heart.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“When we get you to the plantation you will be better, my dear girl,”</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">said Clifton, kindly, shaking her hand and letting it go.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Captain Clifton rode away full of thought—speculating more upon</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Catherine’s reserve than became a gentleman of his station and</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">importance. What was it to him that a rustic girl was too shy to express</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">in person, her thanks for a favor received, even though she had “screwed</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">her courage to the sticking place” to write to him and solicit it? Many</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">people, more conversant with the world than Catherine, can write that</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">which they never can bring their lips to say. Besides it was no</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">matter—what was that lowly maiden to him, the heir of Clifton, and the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">prospective husband of the highest and haughtiest lady in the land?</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Yes—what to him except an object of his high patronage could be that</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">girl of—not only “humble parentage,” but indubitably _low birth_? He</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">rode on dissatisfied, he knew not wherefore, with her and himself.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">As for Catherine, she stood—lost—where he had left her—lost to the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">consciousness of her grandfather’s and of Carl’s presence—with her eyes</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">fixed upon the ground, blaming herself for her awkwardness and seeming</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">ingratitude; wondering if _he_ blamed her too; wondering why it was that</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">when she saw him enter she grew cold and trembled so; and when he spoke</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">to her in that gentle tone, and looked at her with that gentle gaze—her</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">whole nature shrank away in fear and trepidation—and though she would</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">have given the world for the ability to express her gratitude and</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">regard, all power of uttering a grateful word or of lifting a grateful</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">glance to his face, deserted, and left her pale and trembling before the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">man whom she had no cause to fear, and every reason to trust. Catherine</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">stood with her mind deep in this problem, until the harsh voice of Carl</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">startled her, saying, in rasping tones—</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Well! are you going to stand there burrowing your eyes in the ground</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">all day? A pretty way you have behaved! Please goodness, you’ve got no</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">more manners than a dumb brute. I take my oath I am ashamed of you! Now</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">there was Captain Clifton, a gentleman of so high rank, condescending to</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">come here and tell us himself of the place he had got for us, even after</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">your unmannerly refusal of that first place—and here were you with not</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">one _word_ of thanks to give—no! please Heaven, not so much as one civil</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">_look_! I wonder what he’ll think of you?”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“What, indeed?” repeated Catherine, very meekly.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">But Carl scarcely recognized her voice. It was no longer the childish</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">treble—it was the deep, full, melodious voice of rich womanhood.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Why, the _kindest_ thought he can have of you, will be to think you are</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">a _fool_—that is all.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Carl, I was in fear of him.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“In fear of him! In fear of Archer Clifton! A man whom all the country</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">knows to be of the highest honor—and one to whom even _I_, cautious as</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">_I_ am, could trust you with, to go from one end of the world to the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">other!”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“I know that, Carl—I know he is a gentleman of honor, but—but—I tremble</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">before him, and have not courage to lift my eyes—”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“But that is so confoundedly ridiculous, now! _why_ are you afraid of</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">him?”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Kate shook her head and waved her hand in that quick, short manner which</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">was peculiar to her, and turned away—repeating in her own heart the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">question—“Yes, why, _why_, WHY?”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Whether the maiden found an answer to her question or not, remained a</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">secret to Carl; this was the first and last conversation they ever held</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">on the subject; and whatever phenomena the opening heart of the maiden</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">revealed to herself, were carefully shrouded away from the eyes of all.</span></p>

<p class="p3"><span class="s2">How beautiful was Carolyn Clifton! So fair, so purely, so divinely fair,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">so radiant, so refined, so stately! How fit a consort for the proud</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Archer Clifton! How his heart swelled with admiration and pride as he</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">gazed upon her queenly form—and how it glowed to think that in a very</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">few days that fair and stately lady, who never deigned to own a passion,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">whose love he only guessed by her proud exaction of exclusive service,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">who scarcely condescended to extend her snowy hand to his salute—would</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">be his own, his own, his wife, his property, his other self—whose form</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">he might press to his bosom in the fullest freedom of possession! And as</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">he sat by her side and held her hand, and gazed upon her inaccessible,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">delightful beauty; oh! how slowly, slowly, to his impatient, burning,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">throbbing heart—how slowly, dragged the days and hours.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Well—oh very well would it have been for Archer Clifton, could he have</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">rent his gaze from his magnetic idol a moment, and caught a certain pair</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">of evil eyes upon him. Their baleful glare might have shed upon his path</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">some light to the pitfalls in his way.</span></p>

<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Carl Kavanagh and his sister were settled in the log cabin on the farm</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">of Hardbargain. Carl, as an old acquaintance of the mistress, and a late</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">laborer on the plantation, fell readily into his new business of</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">overseeing it. Catherine began to busy herself in the management of her</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">new and very comfortable home. Their cabin contained a sitting-room,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">kitchen, and two chambers. Mrs. Clifton had gratified her own kindly and</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">benevolent disposition by adding several plain articles of furniture to</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">the small stock possessed by the poor family. She had, besides, given</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Catherine a set of half-worn, white dimity curtains, and a pair of</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">coarse, home-made, white counterpanes. These gave an air of neatness,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">approaching—I had almost said refinement to the sitting-room, and two</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">little bed-rooms. Mrs. Clifton, of Hardbargain, was not addicted to</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">taking sudden likings—indeed, though a lady of perfect frankness,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">benevolence and liberality of judgment, she was cool and prudent—yet,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">notwithstanding this her kindest affections were at once attracted</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">towards Kate. It is true she had been prepared to think well of the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">child from an intimate knowledge of her brother Carl’s honesty and</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">intelligence, but at the first sight of Catherine, the noble countenance</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">of the mountain-girl riveted her esteem. There are some faces which we</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">know at a glance cannot belong to other than a fine, high-toned</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">character. And such a countenance was that of Catherine. And it won upon</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">the lady every day, as no merely beautiful face could ever have done.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">For hers was a brow—</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>“Where every god did seem to set his seal to give the world assurance</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2"><span class="Apple-converted-space">    </span>of—”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">a peerless woman. Often Mrs. Clifton invited Catherine to bring her work</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">and sit with her through the afternoon, and seldom did she let the girl</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">return without placing in her hand some book just suitable to her very</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">age, and the stage of progress of her mind. And oh! did not the heart of</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">the maiden kindle and glow with love and admiration for the noble lady,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">who, without one particle of pride, or the least pretension to</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">condescension—condescended so much. And so Catherine grew to understand</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">and appreciate Mrs. Clifton, and to look upon her with a feeling</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">amounting almost to worship. How happy were those afternoons spent with</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">her in the cool and breezy parlor. How deeply grateful was Kate for all</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">her benefits—how anxious to prove her gratitude—to do something for her</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">benefactress. But Kate was very shy, and her love only spoke in the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">stealthy look of affection fixed upon the lady, and withdrawn with a</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">deeply blushing cheek if discovered. But by these tokens sure did Mrs.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Clifton know the sweetness and the tenderness, the modesty and the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">sincerity of the maiden’s hidden heart. And all this time was Catherine</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">wishing for the ability to tell her friend how much she thanked and</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">loved her. One afternoon she mustered up the courage to tell the lady</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">that she should like to read to her any time that it would be agreeable;</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">also, that she had some skill in doing up laces and such things and that</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">she should be happy if she could assist Mrs. Clifton in such matters.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Mrs. Clifton placed her hand affectionately on Catherine’s head, and</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">declined all her offers of service except that which related to the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">reading—which she accepted—hoping thereby to improve her protégé in many</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">ways—to direct her choice of books, to correct her elocution, and to</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">awaken her understanding of what she read by questions and comments. So</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">they began a course of historical reading with Rollin’s Ancient History.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">And that which this excellent lady commenced as a duty of kindness soon</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">became a matter of daily recreation. It was indeed a rare intellectual</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">pleasure to arouse, cultivate and hold communion with a fresh, vigorous,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">original enthusiastic mind like that of Catherine. And those afternoons</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">were almost as happy for the lady as for her protégé—happier for</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Catherine they could not have been. Once, the shy girl was entirely</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">carried out of herself and her reverie by the following circumstance:</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">The lady had inadvertently let fall that she was a descendant of Oliver</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Cromwell, when Kate, hurried beyond her consciousness, clasped her hand</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">and gazed fervently up in her face, exclaiming—</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Descended from Oliver Cromwell! Descended from Oliver Cromwell, that</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">friend of man? that friend of freedom? Oh! it is no wonder, lady, that</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">you are so noble, so superior to all the world!”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“My Catherine,” said the lady, calmly withdrawing her hand “You know too</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">little—far too little of the world, to judge how I stand in comparison</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">to others. And what know you of Oliver Cromwell? Our reading has</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">scarcely reached the invasion of Britain by the Romans.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Oh, lady! lady! lady!” said Kate, warmly, being not yet recovered from</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">her trance—“lady—Carl and I had not many books, so we read what we had</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">over and over again! And one of the books we read the most was the life</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">of Oliver Cromwell!”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“You are generally so shy, Catherine, that it is a blind work in me to</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">direct your studies, not knowing what you have read and what you have</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">not.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Yes—very delightful to both were these seasons, and very strong was the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">affection beginning to cement between the lady and the maiden. There was</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">only one thing that disturbed Catherine in the perfect enjoyment of</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">these afternoons. When Archer Clifton would surprise them by suddenly</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">entering the room, and throwing himself into an arm-chair or upon a</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">sofa, her heart would stand still, and her whole frame tremble with an</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">agitation as impossible to comprehend as to conquer. And yet much as his</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">arrival disturbed her, his departure failed to make her happy. On the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">contrary, it left a strange sadness and yearning she could not shake</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">off. But then these things were of rare occurrence. Captain Clifton very</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">seldom found time to visit his mother—he was contented to know that she</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">had a companion;—and as for Kate, he never thought of her at all—she was</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">provided for and forgotten. Body, soul, and spirit were taken</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">up—absorbed in the contemplation of his promised bride, and in the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">anticipation of her possession. Catherine knew he was soon to be</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">married, but what of that? She was a child, with no knowledge at her</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">tender years to understand her own heart, and no skill to define its</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">first developments.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">At White Cliffs “all went merry as a marriage bell.” The “Rockbridge”</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">was at length telegraphed at Norfolk. A letter with an invoice was</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">received by Mr. Clifton, who immediately dispatched a special messenger</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">to receive his valuable portion of the cargo. The wedding-day was fixed</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">for that day week, and great preparations were on foot. The gentry of</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">the neighboring counties were invited. The mansion-house was “swept and</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">garnished” from garret to cellar. Frank and Zuleime were daily</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">rehearsing their parts as bridesmaid and groomsman, which Frank declared</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">to be only an apprenticeship to the business of enacting bride and</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">groom. Some city guests from Richmond had arrived by particular</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">invitation, four or five days before the expected wedding. Last of all</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">came the wagon with the boxes from Norfolk. They were opened in the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">hall—such treasure of splendid attire, and such sets of jewelry! And,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">above all, such a trousseau for the bride—conspicuous in which was the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">bridal dress and veil—the bridal dress and train of richest white</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">brocade heavily embroidered with silver, after the gorgeous fashion of</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">that time—the bridal veil of finest lace—the orange flower wreath of</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">pearls and emeralds—the pearl embroidered gloves and slippers—the pearl</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">and silver mounted fan, and all complete in correspondence. And richer</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">still was a ball-dress of blue silver-embroidered brocade, with its</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">elegant coiffure of ostrich feathers, the sight of which Zuleime</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">declared was enough to precipitate _any_ girl into matrimony.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Every one was too happy, too busy and too self-important to notice the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">deathly hue of Georgia’s cheek, far less to detect the fitful glare of</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">the well-guarded eye. Every one but her husband, who, leaving his</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">daughters and their maids to unpack the boxes, followed her into her own</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">chamber, saying, as he fondly laid his hand upon her shoulder—</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“My darling doesn’t seem to be merry.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">She shrank—shuddered from his touch, exclaiming, almost shrilly—</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Leave me!”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Leave you, my dear!—my child,—why leave you?” he asked, passing his</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">hand gently around her shoulders.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Leave me, leave me!” she cried, sharply, casting off the arm and</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">springing back—her cheek blanched, her teeth snapping, her eyes</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">sparkling fire, more like a terrified wolf than a woman, “have I not</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">told you never, _never_ to come near me in my dark hour?”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“But why should my cherished pet have dark hours?” he persisted,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">approaching her.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Keep off! keep off! old man, you know not what you do!”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Yes, I’m old—I know I’m old—I wish I wasn’t, for I love you, my</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">darling. Yes, I love you more tenderly and less selfishly than if I was</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">younger. I love you entirely—altogether—your little dark face—your</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">little fiery ways—your little outbursts of temper that no one sees but</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">me, who look upon it with indulgent eyes. Would a young man love you so</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">tenderly, Georgia?”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Driveller! you make me loathe you! ‘My little fiery ways.’ ‘My little</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">outbursts of temper,’ forsooth! How little do you understand me! You</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">sting my soul to frenzy with your dotage, and then twaddle about liking</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">my ‘_little outbursts of temper_,’ forsooth.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Dotage! Yes! I really do suppose you consider it dotage!”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Yes! drivelling! idiotic! imbecile dotage!”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Yes! I do suppose you think it is! I am too old for you, Georgia—I know</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">it, alas! too well, now that it is too late—and yet you did not raise</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">the least objection to becoming my wife, Georgia.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Ha! ha! ha! ha! ha! ha! ha! _Objection!_ I was but fifteen years of age</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">when you bribed me to your arms with a set of jewels, and a gold mounted</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">work-box! I was a child, delighted with glittering toys! and fond, yes!</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">_very_ fond of the grandfatherly old man that poured them into my lap!</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Did _that_ child-fondness deceive you?”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“It did, it did! You were very fond of me when you were a child! Would</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">to God I could have spell-bound you to that age, so you never could have</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">grown older! Oh! I could find it in heart to shame my manhood, to shame</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">my gray hairs and weep! I should not have married you, Georgia, child! I</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">should not have sacrificed you to my selfish love—yet, no! It was _not_</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">selfish love! I wished your greatest good. I wished to surround you for</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">life with all the means and appliances of happiness. I wished to lavish</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">wealth upon you—ay, wealth of gold, and wealth of affection, too! I</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">wished to give you a sumptuous home, splendid apparel, costly jewels,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">carriages, servants—all those things which women value so much, and</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">scheme, and plot, and endeavor for so perseveringly! I wished to give</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">them all to my darling, before she should have time to feel the need of</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">them!”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Ha! ha! ha! ha! ha!” bitterly laughed the girl. “Oh! do you know what</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">women value more than gold and jewels, and dress, and carriages, and</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">horses, and servants?—I’ll tell you—the ungalled, unfettered heart’s</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">freedom!”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“I know it! Oh! I know it! My love has destroyed your happiness. Oh,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Georgia! did you never see a beautiful bird, and long to have it for</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">your own, only to caress and pamper and pet it? Oh, Georgia! my child,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">my pet, my bird! that was the reason I wanted you! I wanted to cherish,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">and fondle, and make you happy!”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“_Ah-h!_ And did _you_ never see such a bird as you spoke of, in spite</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">of all the petting, and pampering, and fondlings, beat out its weary</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">life against its prison bars and die?”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Don’t die, Georgia! Don’t die! Hope! Alas! I wished only to make you</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">happy—I have failed! I have made you miserable!”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“‘_Miserable_,’ ruined! despairing! desperate!” she cried, wildly</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">wringing her hands.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Nay, not despairing, Georgia! I am an old man, as you justly</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">said—_quite_ an old man. I have not very long to live, and when I die,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Georgia, you will still be a very young woman. Bethink you, you are</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">scarce seventeen—in ten years more you will be but twenty-seven, and is</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">it even likely that I shall live so long as that? No! And after my heart</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">is cold, and my head is laid low, Georgia will be a beautiful young</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">widow—ay, and with a rich jointure, too! I shall take care of that!”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Ha! ha! ha! ha! ha! _pathetic!_ I tell you, that if you were to die</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">to-morrow, my life is not the less ruined—despairing!” bitterly</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">exclaimed the young woman.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Nay, but that cannot be, Georgia. Ruined? Despairing? What! at</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">seventeen years of age? Nonsense, my love! _Nothing_ but crime can make</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">the youthful despair! Nonsense, my child! You are hysterical!” he said,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">moving towards her with outstretched arms.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Dotard! driveller!” she cried, turning fiercely upon him, with eyes</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">blazing with scorn and malignity. “_Imbecile!_ Will you leave me to</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">myself?”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">The old gentleman turned away, walked several times slowly up and down</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">the floor, and finally saying—</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Yes, I know I am a dotard! I know it, and I grow ashamed of dotage—”</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">clapped his hat upon his head and walked out.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Bitterly did the old man rue his folly, yet, alas! he knew but half the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">cause of that ingrate and wretched woman’s fierce outbreaks of temper.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">She followed his retreating form, with a glaring of mingled rage and</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">fear, gnawing her white lips, while she muttered, in a low, fierce tone—</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“I could tear my heart out! I could bite my tongue off, for thus</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">betraying me! Shall I ever have power to chain and guide the tiger in</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">me? But _he_ with his doting, and _they_ with their dalliance, goad me</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">to extremity? _But_,” she exclaimed, clenching her fist, setting her</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">teeth, and glaring, while all her countenance darkened with rage and</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">anguish—“_But_, before they shall MARRY under my very eyes, and live</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">here, maddening my soul and senses, day and night, by the view of their</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">love and joy, I will pull down ruin on the heads of all! Yes, although</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">myself should be the first to fall!” She paused in silent thought some</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">time, then rising, said, “_Down_, tiger heart! _Down!_ crouch! Be</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">smooth, brow! Be smiling, lip! Be tender, eyes! Be soft, voice! And now</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">to go and pacify the old man, before his vexation betrays me to the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">others. Ah! it is well _they_ have never witnessed my excitement! Come!</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">in time I shall learn to curb wild impulses, and only spring upon my</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">prey when time and place is fit!”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Soft, smooth, fascinating, seductive, she glided from her chamber out</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">into the upper piazza, where the old man’s slow and heavy footfall was</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">heard—she glided after him, and with an air of sweet, familiar, childish</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">freedom, she raised his arm, and putting her beautiful head under it,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">drew his hand around her neck and over her bosom, and looking up</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">pleadingly, simply, into his benevolent face, murmured, merely—</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“I am so sorry Mr. Clifton!”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Never mind! never mind, my dear!” said the old gentleman, stooping and</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">kissing her brow.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Oh, but I _am_! _so sorry_!”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“You, child! Do you think I mind your little petulance?”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Oh! you are good, you are good. Indeed, I’m quite unworthy of you!” she</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">whispered softly, pressing her head against his bosom, and clinging</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">close.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“You, darling!” cried the old man, stroking her curls in delight.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“I am such an irritable, petulant child! I am sure no one would have</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">patience with me but you—that is the reason I love you so!”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“You do love me then?” gazing fondly in her witching face.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Oh, dearly! dearly! look in my eyes and see if I don’t!”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Yes! I know you do, my pet! And I love you entirely!”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Ah! how can you then! I have so many faults!”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“I love your little faults, and all! Come! Brighten up! Never mind! I</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">love to see my darling bright and cheerful.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Ah! how can I, when I remember my fit of ill temper!”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Say no more about it, my love! That’s the reason why I love you! For</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">those very little gusts of temper! They are followed by such a sweet</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">reaction! and then my child is so frank, so ingenuous in her little</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">penitence!”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Ah! But then I am such a spoiled child! And always was! Father spoiled</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">me. And now you spoil me worse than ever!”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“My sweet! you can’t be spoiled! you are so ingenuous! But now tell me,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">what vexed my little girl this evening? Come, let me hear?” asked the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">old man, caressing the syren.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Well! now it was this! I thought you loved Carolyn and Zuleime better</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">than me!” replied the artful woman, gazing half-reproachfully,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">half-pleadingly up into his smiling face.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Love Carolyn and Zuleime better than you! Why you jealous little</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">witch!” exclaimed the old man in rapture. “Love _them_ more than you!</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Why, I have to pray Heaven’s pardon daily, for not loving them a</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">hundredth part as much!—kiss me!”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Georgia nerved her loathing heart to give the demanded kiss, and then</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">went and joined the party in the parlor, as beautiful, smooth,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">seductive, dangerous as ever; while the old man walked up and down the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">piazza, smiling to himself and saying—</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“She is a child—nothing but a child!—a sweet, willful, witching child!”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Alas! little recking of the household treachery, the household wreck</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">that “child” was preparing!</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>

<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2"><span class="Apple-converted-space">                </span>Alas! they had been friends in youth,</span></p>

<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">What ruin a single spark of fire may spread, if carelessly or designedly</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">dropped amid combustible or inflammable material.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">What desolation a single word may cause, if thoughtlessly or</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">intentionally let fall into a passionate, impetuous heart.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">The three scenes I am about to describe, took place very nearly as they</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">are related.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">But first a few words of explanation.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">I feel that I have scarcely done justice to the character of Carolyn</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Clifton, in presenting her only by that cold and frosty crust of pride,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">which was but the superficial covering of a high-spirited, honorable</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">nature. Her manners were cold and haughty—almost scornful and</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">arrogant—it is but too true. And most people, her family included,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">supposed her to be destitute of sensibility. Perhaps she was lacking in</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">warmth of affection for her immediate domestic circle. Her whole heart,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">with all its deep, profound, untold, unguessed devotion, was given to</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Archer Clifton. And while secretly bestowing upon him her entire,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">undivided love—she openly exacted a full, unshared return—an exclusive</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">worship.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">In truth, in her proud, secret heart, she _was_ a little jealous of</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Clifton’s affection for his mother! _She_ did not love her _father_ so</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">devotedly!—why should _Clifton_ worship his _mother_ so? To this</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">jealousy she had never given breath, of course—indeed, to her own</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">passionate love, she had never yet given word—preferring, in her high</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">toned, maiden pride, to leave it to be inferred. She had never even</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">_looked_ her jealousy, yet Mrs. Clifton, with the fine instinct of a</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">woman and a mother, guessed it, and in her presence, skillfully eluded</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">all demonstrations of affection from her son. And so well was the proud,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">exacting spirit of Miss Clifton known in her own family, that even the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">sprightly and mischievous outlaw, Zuleime, dared take no childish</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">liberty with her sister’s betrothed. Thus it happened that Frank</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Fairfax’s unlucky jest had deeply offended the arrogant lady, the more</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">especially as in that day, and in that neighborhood, the term</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“mountain-girl,” was too often the mildest name for an evil woman.—This</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">fact, of course, Frank was not acquainted with. And, therefore it was,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">that he could not understand Carl Kavanagh’s excessive anxiety to send</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">his young sister off the mountain; and could not in the least comprehend</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">the intense indignation of Miss Clifton, and the difficulty Archer</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Clifton had in restoring her good humor. Even now, Carolyn Clifton had</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">not forgotten the circumstance. And truth to tell, she was not well</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">pleased at the continued interest displayed by Captain Clifton for his</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">protégé, in bringing her and her family upon his mother’s plantation.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">But she was too proud again to allude to the subject. Carolyn Clifton</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">had never known a care or a contradiction in her life. Her heart was a</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">sound, strong, high, proud thing, and therefore, very like to break</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">itself without fear, full tilt against the first impediment that opposed</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">it. She was, besides, like all women of her fair complexion and fine</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">tempered nerves—“a discerner of spirits.” And this quick, delicate, and</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">sure perception never failed her, except when she was agitated and</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">blinded by inward passion. Thus, perhaps, quite unconsciously, she read</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">the heart of her betrothed—and knew it better than he did himself—and</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">thus, perhaps, involuntarily, she afterwards acted on that knowledge.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">At all events, there was quite enough combustible material on hand for a</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">single spark to ignite it and spread a conflagration.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">And the spark—and many sparks were not wanting. A thoughtless jest of</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Frank’s—a slight word dropped by Georgia at exactly the right, or rather</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">the _wrong_ time and place—and the whole neighborhood of R—— County were</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">agog with gossip. And Captain Clifton and his protégé, were the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">subjects. Some, right in the face of his well-known engagement to Miss</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Clifton, did not hesitate to say that she, his protégé, was a beautiful</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">girl, whom he intended to educate and marry, and that his republican</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">mother was highly in favor of the plan. Others told how tastefully the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">overseer’s house had been furnished and adorned, and—without the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">slightest foundation in truth—how many hours a day Captain Clifton now</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">spent with his interesting pupil. The suspicious and malignant</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">circulated a still darker tale, and wondered how long it would last, and</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">how it would all end. And then they denounced Captain Clifton, blamed</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">his mother, and pitied Miss Clifton! And all this time, while the whole</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">county was ringing with various and contradictory reports, the persons</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">most concerned knew nothing about it.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Until the day before the wedding, it was suddenly brought to the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">knowledge of both parties, in the following manner:—</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">The company assembled at Clifton, consisting of old Mr. Clifton’s</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">brother-in-law and sister, Judge and Mrs. Cabell, of Richmond, with</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">their three daughters and son, Frank Fairfax, Zuleime, and Captain</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Clifton, had gone over to dine by previous engagement with Mrs. Clifton,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">of Hardbargain. Carolyn Clifton had been compelled, by a slight</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">headache, to remain at home. And Georgia had chosen to stay to keep her</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">company. The two ladies sat in the dressing-room of Miss Clifton.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Carolyn was silent and abstracted, yet her countenance betrayed more of</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">inward joy than she suspected. A great contrast was her fair, placid</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">face, to that of Georgia, dark, and traversed by spasms of pain-like</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">clouds hurling past a stormy sky. But if Carolyn lifted her fair lashes</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">a moment, instantly that dark face cleared, ere its expression could be</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">detected. At length she ventured, in a sweet tone, to say—</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Carolyn, my dear, to-morrow is your wedding-day. And—but—there is</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">something which you ought to know beforehand, and which for weeks past I</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">have been trying to gain courage to tell you.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Well, madam?” asked Miss Clifton, slowly lifting her snowy lids.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“I should—that is, I _might_ expose myself to the resentment of all your</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">family by telling you.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Then you had best not tell me, madam.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“And yet you ought to be informed, and must. _I_ should never forgive a</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">friend for keeping such a secret from me.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">A vague fear and tremor seized upon Carolyn Clifton, and kept her</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">silent. The dark lady went on—</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“I think the honor, the happiness, even the tranquillity of your married</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">life, depends upon your previous knowledge of this circumstance.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Madam—the honor, happiness, and tranquillity of my married life pass</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">into the keeping of my husband, Captain Clifton, and in him I have the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">utmost confidence,” remarked Carolyn, coldly and proudly, though,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">alas!—not _truly_.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Heaven forbid that I should unnecessarily mar that confidence! But, my</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">love, you will be sure to hear it, when too late, and from less friendly</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">lips than mine!”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Will it please you, then, madam, to speak out frankly and honestly, and</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">let us know what it is,” said Carolyn, scornfully, at the same time that</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">her heart was rising with emotion.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Is it possible you do not guess?”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“I do not take the trouble to do so, Mrs. Clifton.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Ah! you have always treated me with scorn and hauteur, Miss Clifton.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Yet that, alas! does not relieve me of the painful duty of putting you</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">on your guard. In a word, then, do you understand the nature of the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">relations subsisting between Captain Clifton and the sister of his</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">mother’s overseer?”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">The brow of Carolyn Clifton flushed crimson—but she answered, coldly—</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Madam, I believe that young person has been the object of Captain</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Clifton’s benevolence.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Ah! I believe so too! His benevolence is certainly indisputable, and</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">his honor _should_ be above suspicion!” exclaimed Georgia, fervently.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Madam—_it is_!” coldly replied Miss Clifton.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Yes—and yet, Carolyn, my love, a poor and beautiful young maiden cannot</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">continue to be the recipient of a handsome young officer’s beneficence</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">with credit to herself, honor to him, or _peace_ or safety to his wife!”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Is she so very beautiful?” was the question surmised from the haughty</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">girl.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Passing beautiful, I think, Carolyn, and this it is that makes the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">country gentlemen jest so about the matter. _They_ give a far different</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">motive than _benevolence_ to the kindness of Captain Clifton to his</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">lovely charge. _I_ know that they do him gross injustice! But this thing</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">should not go on. It is a dangerous relation—dangerous to Archer’s own</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">fidelity, dangerous to your peace, and most dangerous of all, to the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">poor girl’s reputation. I advise you to speak to Archer. I would do so</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">myself, but it is too delicate a matter for me to speak to a young</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">gentleman about. Now in these palmy days of courtship, he may listen to</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">you as he never would, perhaps, afterwards, and you will be able to</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">prevail with him to send this dangerous young beauty, his protégé, away.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Yes! and you may tell Archer that _I_ advise this, for the good of all</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">parties. Tell him that the whole neighborhood is ringing with gossip</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">that may become slander. Tell him that I say the parties most concerned</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">in this rumor, or in any rumor, will be ever the last to hear it. Tell</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">him that I, his friend, Georgia, venture to do him this service,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">informing him through you. Let there be no concealments. Let all be open</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">candor. I did feel afraid, when I began to tell you this—but now it is</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">out, I feel relieved—I have more courage.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Madam!” said Carolyn, more haughtily than before—“Captain Clifton is</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">quite capable of directing his own conduct! And if he were _not_, I</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">should never resign to him the future control of mine! And, farthermore,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">madam!” she added, sarcastically, “I too highly honor the man about to</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">become my husband—I have too much self-respect and delicacy, to inquire</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">into the nature of Captain Clifton’s individual and private amusements,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">whether they relate to hounds, horses, or beggar girls! I leave such</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">investigations to——_the daughter of the sign-painter_!” and with an air</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">of the greatest possible scorn and arrogance, she arose, and left the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">room. Yet under that proud, disdainful bearing, a thousand scorpions, of</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">doubt and jealousy, maddened her soul. She went at once into her own</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">room, and having locked the door, that no rash intruder should look upon</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">her weakness, gave herself up to the anguish of her emotions—now pacing</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">up and down the floor, wringing her hands in distraction—now throwing</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">herself, face downward, upon the bed, in despair. And yet she had no</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">confidence in Mrs. Clifton’s honesty of purpose either.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2"><span class="Apple-converted-space">                  </span>* <span class="Apple-converted-space">      </span>* <span class="Apple-converted-space">      </span>* <span class="Apple-converted-space">      </span>* <span class="Apple-converted-space">      </span>*</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">In the meantime, the party assembled at Hardbargain were enjoying</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">themselves and the hospitalities of their hostess, to the fullest</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">extent.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">The late dinner was over; the ladies were lounging about in arm-chairs,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">or on sofas, in the breezy parlor—dozing, reading, or chatting in low</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">tones, all serenely enjoying that pleasant feeling of home freedom and</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">repose, into which Mrs. Clifton ever charmed her guests.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">The gentlemen had left their wine, and in parties of two and three were</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">strolling about the shady yard, or out through the fields and orchards,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">to cool their heads, previous to joining the ladies at the tea-table.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Archer Clifton, with his cousin, Major Charles Cabell, and Frank</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Fairfax, took the wooded path leading down the South side of the ridge</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">to a fine spring in the hollow. They came to a log cabin, half hidden by</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">surrounding and overhanging elms—and literally covered with climbing and</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">creeping vines. Before the door sat a girl, spinning on a little wheel,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">who, at the first glimpse of strangers, instantly arose, and taking up</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">her wheel, retired into the house. Captain Clifton left his companions,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">and going up to the door, called, saying—</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Catherine, my good girl, bring me a gourd here.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Kate Kavanagh came, and with her eyes fixed upon the ground, and her</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">face suffused with a deep blush, handed the required article, and</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">instantly disappeared within.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“By all the angels, what a fine face!” exclaimed Major Cabell, gazing</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">after her.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Archer Clifton shot a quick, piercing glance at the speaker, who,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">meeting it full as he turned, laughed, exclaiming, as if a new discovery</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">had been made—</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Oh! Ay! Soh! you are _there_, are you? So then, this is the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">mountain-beauty, the hidden treasure of Archer Clifton, that has set all</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">the country ladies agog with scandal, and all the country gentlemen mad</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">with envy?”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">The hot blood rushed to Clifton’s brow.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Oh! now, don’t be jealous! Don’t be alarmed! Your treasure is safe from</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">me—though, by all the queens of chivalry, hers is a noble face—a face to</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">bleed and die for! None of your pretty lily and rose baby beauties that</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">may be seen by hundreds anywhere—but a noble girl, fit for a monarch’s</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">love and counsellor!”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">In an instant Archer Clifton strode up and stood with bended brow and</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">folded arms before him; and said, in a low, deep, stern tone of</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">concentrated passion—</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“You are my relative, friend, guest! Your three-fold claim upon my</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">forbearance should protect you from any resentment for words spoken</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">against _my_ honor. But, I charge you, retract your words! And if you</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">harbor one single suspicion against that young girl, you are a villain!</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">S’death, sir! Has the world come to such a pass, and is the honor of</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Archer Clifton of so little worth, that he cannot protect a poor young</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">maiden without injury to her? By Heaven! be warned! For if you do but</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">breathe one breath to dim the lustre of that girl’s good name—by the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">good Lord that made us good, and the demon that turned us to evil!</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">relative, friend and guest as you are, I will slay and drag you to her</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">feet to die!”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">So sudden, so mighty—so appalling was this burst of passion, that for a</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">moment after it was over, Cabell and Fairfax stood as if transfixed with</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">astonishment. Then Cabell, in the frankest way in the world, held out</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">his hand, exclaiming—</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“I like that! D—d if I don’t! Come, Clifton—I was wrong, forgive me!</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">give me your hand! By my soul, I like a man that will stand up</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">for—there! by all that’s fatal, I had liked to have tripped again!”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Understand me, sir,” said Archer Clifton, sternly. “You know me to be</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">on the eve of marriage with our cousin. She is my liege lady, and never</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">for one instant in thought, word or deed, has my allegiance swerved from</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">her service. And more, gentlemen, both! A single word touching the fair</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">fame of _her_—of Catherine, I mean—touches _me home_.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">They were here overtaken by two or three other gentlemen, and the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">conversation took another and less perilous turn, as they wandered down</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">towards the mineral spring. After slaking their thirst, the party</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">divided. Major Cabell joined the three latest comers, and Clifton and</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Fairfax turned towards the farm-house.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“You seem to be moody this evening, Archer,” said Frank, after they had</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">pursued their way for some time in silence.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Yes—that foolish jest of Cabell’s has annoyed me. It is villainous! It</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">is diabolical! Such light words, in which a young girl’s fair fame is</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">laughed and jested away, may be thoughtless, but they should be punished</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">with death!”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“That’s a harsh sentence!”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“A _just_ one!”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“You feel this bitterly!”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“I DO. For _her_ name has been used! Frank! you believe that if a word</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">of disrespect were to be breathed by any man against my mother, I would</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">lay that man dead at my feet without an instant’s grace?”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Yes! I thoroughly believe that you would send such an one to his last</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">account in a great hurry.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“And if any one were but to _look_ an insult to Catherine, it would</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">rouse all the ferocity of the demon in me to overthrow and trample him</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">to death!”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“‘All this I steadfastly believe,’ as the catechism says about total</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">depravity!”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“And, Frank! you, yourself have sometimes spoken flippantly of my regard</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">for that girl—never so insultingly as Cabell did just now, else you</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">would not now possess my esteem and friendship—but you have _trifled_</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">with the subject. Now understand, Frank, that I shall consider it a deep</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">personal affront in future if you repeat it!”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“You haven’t heard me joke to you about Kate for a long time.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“No—I certainly have not.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“No—for be hanged if the matter is not getting far too _serious_ for</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">jesting!”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“What do you mean?”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Archer! Have you never heard it said that those whom it concerns</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">_first_ to be made acquainted with an injurious report are usually the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">_last_ to hear it, and when they are _innocent_, they are the more</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">exposed for _being_ innocent, because they never _suspect_ the slander,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">and never _guard_ against it?”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“In Heaven’s name, what do you mean?”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“_This_. Cabell’s jest was but the echo of the whole county talk. I have</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">been asked, I suppose, twenty times, by twenty different young men, to</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">tell them all about our adventure upon the mountain.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“That was because _you_ first of all represented it as an adventure.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“I confess it! In shame and confusion I confess it—but then many times I</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">am also asked what is the precise nature of the relations subsisting</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">between yourself and this girl?”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“No, NO!”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Yes, I tell you!”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“No! no one dares to question that!”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“But they _do_, I tell you! Ay, and _answer_ their own questions in a</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">manner that reflects very little honor upon the parties!”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Would God I had never seen the girl! Would God I had never brought her</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">here! I would give my right hand rather than evil should befall her! But</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">who is it that dares slander her? Tell me! Give me some name! Let me</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">have SOME one to make an example of!”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Nay, Clifton! you can’t make an example of women and children!” said</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Frank, evasively.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“By Heaven, sir, they have husbands and fathers, who shall be held</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">accountable for the license of tongue they allow their wives and</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">daughters!”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Nay, now, Archer! This is a mere matter of gossip, that will die out,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">if you are discreet!”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“To dare to talk of _her_! They never looked upon her face! Else they</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">never could associate the thought of evil with that noble brow, those</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">thoughtful eyes, and serious lips! To slander _her_!”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Nay, nay—it is _not_ slander; only what I am afraid should _become_</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">such. It is only fun—joke—”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“To dare to joke of _her_!”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“‘_Her!_’ Verily, Clifton, any one to hear you breathe ‘_her!_’ with</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">your full soul’s volume poured into the little word, would think there</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">was but one ‘_her_’ in the world! Archy, you take a very strange</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">interest in that girl. Are you sure that you are not in love with her?”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“In love with her! Nonsense—she is a child!”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Well then, are you sure you should not be in love with her, if she were</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">a woman?”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Ridiculous! She is a low-born girl!”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Oh I forgot! I beg pardon! You demonstrated that to me before.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“And, besides, sir, please to remember that all my love and faith are</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">due to my cousin, Miss Clifton; and that _she_ has my whole heart! I</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">love, admire, honor, my beautiful betrothed bride—nor for her proud sake</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">will I brook that any one should think it possible that I could even in</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">thought fail in full loyalty to my liege lady! But, Frank! my soul’s</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">dear brother! as I tell you everything, I will tell you this! that I</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">feel the very deepest interest in Catherine’s welfare! If you ask me</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">_why_—I tell you I do not know! It surprises and confounds myself! But</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">from the first moment I looked upon her noble face, I felt that interest</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">stir within my deepest soul. And it has never since ceased!”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“I swear you are enamored of her!”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Preposterous, Frank! you make me angry! It is a very different thing</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">from being enamored of her, let me tell you! There is my beautiful, but</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">cold and scornful bride, up at Clifton! Well, I am the most patient of</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">all adoring slaves! I wait upon her sovereign eyes all day long! I am</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">proud to submit to her whims—to do her lightest bidding, and pick up her</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">lap-dog—or to obey her severest command, and exile myself from her</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">gracious presence all day long! But now observe the difference! I feel a</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">deep, strong, strange interest in Kate. I cannot account for it. I feel</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">a sort of unratified right of property in her. I wish to do her good.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">But I wish that all the good she may ever possess in the world, may come</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">from only me! and that for all good things with which I cannot supply</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">her, she may _suffer_ the want rather than owe their possession to</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">another! Very like _love_, is it not? But I wish to control her destiny!</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">I wish to have her in my power!—_in all honor, however!_ It galls me to</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">think that I have no right of authority or guardianship over her! I</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">ardently desire such a right! I long to have the disposal of her person</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">and fate! I crave with a frantic craving, to have more than a</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">father’s—more than a husband’s—more than a master’s right over her! I</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">would to God she were born mine—my own—body, soul and spirit! My own to</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">use or abuse—to crown or kill, as I listed!” exclaimed Clifton,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">passionately, while his cheeks and very lips were white and dry, and his</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">eyes burned with a fierce, consuming, inward fire. And forgetting all</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">things real, he felt as in a vision, a girl’s spirit swoop down upon his</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">bosom, and a dream voice murmur in his ear—“Oh! if it will give you one</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">instant’s joy to press me strongly to your heart—crush me to death in</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">the fold, and my soul will exhale in rapture to Heaven.” The fervid</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">vision came and passed like lightning, and Clifton roused himself from</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">reverie, with a smile and a sneer, saying—“Very like love, all that! is</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">it not?”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">But as Frank did not reply, and as they had now arrived at the gate</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">leading into the yard, the conversation ceased.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">The early tea-table was set out under the shade of the great oaks, and</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">the ladies were walking about, taking the evening air in the yard. As</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">supper was only waiting the arrival of Captain Clifton and Mr. Fairfax,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">it was now speedily served.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">After tea was over, the carriages were all brought round and the company</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">took leave of Mrs. Clifton, and departed.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Captain Clifton and Mr. Fairfax were the last to leave. They mounted</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">their horses and took the bridle-path down the mountain side. This</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">separated them from the rest of their party, who went by the road. They</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">did not, however, converse. Frank was thoughtful, and Clifton himself</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">buried in a deep reverie.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">It was quite early when they arrived at White Cliffs; and the remainder</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">of the party had not yet arrived. Mr. Fairfax joined Mrs. Clifton in the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">garden, and Archer Clifton sought his lady-love, where he was informed</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">he would find her, namely, in the Summer saloon. He threw down his hat</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">and entered hurriedly, intending to surprise from her a hasty kiss.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Carolyn was standing looking out of the window upon the rich sunset</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">scene—the last sun that would set upon her maiden life, perhaps, she</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">thought. On seeing Clifton she moved away, and retreated to the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">work-table at which she seated herself. Clifton approached, and with an</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">air of gallantry, half serious, half playful, kneeled upon one knee and</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">kissed her hand. She drew it coldly away—but that was the custom of the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“proud ladie,” and did not surprise her lover. He arose and drew a chair</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">to her side and seated himself, and began to affect an interest in her</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">little lady-like occupations. Her right hand rested upon a pile of</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">beautifully fine linen cambric handkerchiefs—an item in the imported</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">trousseau. He laid his hand upon hers, and asked her some trivial</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">question about them.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Now, Carolyn, after a day’s extreme suffering, had almost gained a</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">victory over her passion. Her haughtiness had almost saved her. Not to</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">one soul in that house—not to Georgia, had she betrayed the least sign</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">of the cruel suspicion that had nearly maddened her brain. Not for all</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Clifton—not for all the world would she have betrayed her passion to her</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">lover—or condescended to admit that she could be jealous of him; for she</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">felt that once to accuse him would be to impose upon her the necessity</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">of breaking with him. How could she, in honor, marry a man to-morrow</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">whom to-day she had accused of treachery?—besides, she was not</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">sure—could never be sure of his moral dereliction. And while there was a</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">doubt in his favor, she must conquer or conceal all suspicion, or,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">letting escape, must break with him, even at this last moment—must break</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">with him forever! At least so her high spirit and her pride argued. She</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">could not part with him—pride forbade that also.—What! the marriage of</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Miss Clifton of Clifton broken off at the last moment, and all about a</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">mountain-girl? Pah! Forbid it, all the shades of all the buried</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Cliftons! Hearts might break, but haughty heads must not be bowed!</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Better lost peace than lost place! And then she loved him!—loved him the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">deeper for suppressing all signs of love!—and she could not bear to lose</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">him! And banish him she must, if she should once betray the jealous</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">passion of her heart. This mighty motive kept down the rising storm. Yet</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">all depended upon her vigilant self-control. Should a look, a word of</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">suspicion, escape her then, she felt the curbed frenzy of her soul would</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">have broken all bounds; even as by the smallest fracture in the dyke,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">the mighty and irresistible sea is let in upon the land, carrying</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">destruction and death before it! All depended on her silence. So, to</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">keep her lover from noticing her mood,—or fatally inquiring its</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">cause—and to give him employment, she pushed the pile of handkerchiefs</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">towards him, saying calmly—</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Mark them for me.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Clifton smilingly took them, found the little vial of indelible ink, and</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">went to work—himself well pleased to have some service to perform for</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">his liege lady, that would, without disrespect to _her_, deliver _him_</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">from the duty of keeping up a running conversation, for which he felt</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">indisposed.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">She need not have feared that Archer Clifton would observe her mood. He</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">himself was too abstracted, too thoughtful, to be critical or</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">inquisitive. He was deeply troubled by the recollection of the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">conversations of the afternoon, affecting Kate Kavanagh. Instead of</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">benefiting, had he really wronged that excellent girl?—darkened the very</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">morning of her just opening life with the clouds of suspicion? And was</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">even his mother’s protection insufficient to shield her innocence from</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">such attacks of slander? Yes!—for the _fact_ of his mother’s protection</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">was not even acknowledged. Slander shuts its eyes to truth, while it</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">opens its lips to falsehood. Should he send her back to the mountain,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">and expose her to all the evils of that life? No, no!—his whole heart</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">protested against that course. Yet what to do to save her? He could not</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">decide then. He could not even get his own consent to consult his</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">mother. What! wound _her_ ear with the repetition of such a story?</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Never! His usual promptitude of decision and action forsook him quite. A</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">cry was in his heart, and he could only repeat to himself her _name_ in</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">deep sorrow,—“Oh, Kate! Kate! Kate Kavanagh!” until her very name “_Kate</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Kavanagh_,” became the refrain of a plaintive _silent_ melody! Meantime</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">he pursued his occupation quite mechanically, marking and laying down,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">one by one, the handkerchiefs, until the whole dozen was complete.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Carolyn Clifton watched his complete and mournful abstraction with</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">increasing suspicion.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">When all the handkerchiefs were marked, he took the parcel, and shaking</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">off sad thought, smilingly laid them before his lady’s eyes, gayly</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">entreating her to examine his work, and reward him with a kindly word if</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">it should please her.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Miss Clifton took up the parcel, her eyes fell upon the topmost</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">handkerchief, and she started violently. She swiftly turned it over and</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">looked at the second, and the blood rushed to her brow! At the third,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">and it receded again, leaving her pale as death! She hurriedly went</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">through the dozen, then springing to her feet, she hurled the parcel to</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">the floor, and setting her heel upon it, lifted her proud form to its</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">loftiest height, and stood, her chest expanded, her head thrown back,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">her cheek kindling, her eyes blazing,—full! full!—yet proudly</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">suppressing all utterance of passion! Captain Clifton started to his</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">feet, exclaiming—</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Carolyn, my dear cousin!”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">But spurning the parcel beneath her heel, she turned imperiously away,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">and walked up the room.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">He followed her, repeating—</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Carolyn, my dearest Carolyn! what is it?”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Turning and flashing upon him her fierce, imperious eyes, she stretched</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">out her arm, and pointed in scornful silence to the handkerchiefs on the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">floor.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">He went and picked them up to examine them. Oh! treacherous absence of</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">mind! Oh! fatal refrain of the mental melody! Oh! horror of horrors!</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Catastrophe of catastrophes! Upon every handkerchief was beautifully</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">marked—“KATE KAVANAGH.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2"><span class="Apple-converted-space">                             </span>“Confirmation strong</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2"><span class="Apple-converted-space">                       </span>As proof from Holy Writ.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Ay, and a great deal stronger, as sight is more convincing than faith!</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">What was to be done? It was in vain to deny or attempt to explain it!</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Yet he must try, even if he should make himself ridiculous. Hurling the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">fatal “handkerchiefs” down with virulence, he sprang to the side of the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">outraged and indignant beauty; seized her hand, exclaiming, vehemently—</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“My dearest love—pardon! pardon! This is all a mistake!”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Spurning his clasp from her hand, she turned away in arrogant silence.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Dropping upon one knee, he took her hand again, and looking up in her</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">face, said, in a voice of entreaty—</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“My Carolyn! this is all a mistake!—the most absurd mistake! The effect</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">of the merest absence of mind! The most ridiculous thing!”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Oh, sir!” she answered, with slow and withering scorn, drawing her hand</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">away again, “I do not doubt it was a mistake. I never supposed you would</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">dare an intentional insult to my father’s daughter!”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“But, Carolyn, my dearest cousin, only permit me to explain—”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Oh, sir, I _entreat_ you spare me the humiliation of hearing the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">story!” she sneered, with curling lip.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“But, Carolyn, my dear, loved bride! My bride, that will be,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">to-morrow—if you will allow me to tell you all the simple truth—the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">_reason_ why this young girl’s name ran in my head so.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Oh, sir,” she exclaimed, raising both hands, and turning away her head</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">in loathing—“I _implore_ you!—I most _humbly beseech_ you to forbear!</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Spare me _details_ that might shock my—delicacy!”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Carolyn,” he said, gravely and reproachfully rising, and taking her</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">hand—“this does not become you.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Throwing off his hand, with scorn and indignation, she replied—</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“It would less become me, sir, to listen to the history you would tell.”</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Then subsiding into a mood of contemptuous irony, she said, with a</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">sneering smile—“Believe me, sir, I feel more disgusted at your bad taste</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">than shocked at your sin, or wronged by your bad faith. _A</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">mountain-girl!_ Truly, I am humiliated to think so base a rival should</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">have moved me—even to contempt. I am dishonored, sir, in that. Had your</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">wandering fancy fixed upon one of my cousins—one of the elegant Misses</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Cabell, I might have mourned your infidelity, but should have been saved</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">this deep humiliation for myself, and this utter contempt for you—but _a</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">mountain-girl_! A coarse, ignorant, ill-bred mountain-girl! _Oh-h-h!_</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">that you should have stooped, or I should have been moved, by so low a</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">creature as that! I could bury my head with shame!”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Carolyn!” he said, sternly, “permit me to inform you—”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“No, SIR!” she exclaimed, scorn writhing her lips, indignation flashing</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">from her eyes—“No, SIR! You shall tell me NOTHING! It would ill-become</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">my mother’s daughter to listen to the revolting history of—your base</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">amour with the mountain-girl!”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Yes, in the bitterness of her passion, she forgot her maiden delicacy,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">and spoke those shameful words to his astonished ears!</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Miss Clifton!” he replied, severely, folding his arms and gazing</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">sternly and steadily into her blushing face—for she was already blushing</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">for her temerity—until she quailed before him—“Miss Clifton, you mistake</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">my purpose—I have no intention, _now_, to explain anything—the man who</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">would condescend to _deny_ so base a crime as you have charged upon</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">_me_—is not too high or pure to commit it. Therefore, I deign to say</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">nothing for myself. But for the admirable girl that you have slandered—I</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">will say _this_: Had a _man_ dared to asperse the fair fame of Catherine</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Kavanagh—though that man had been my bosom friend—he should have</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">expiated his falsehood with his life:—Had any other _woman_ breathed a</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">breath of slander on her—her husband or her father should have atoned</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">for the fault:—For yourself, Miss Clifton—you shall retract your words,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">before ever I shall call you wife!”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">This roused her passion to ungovernable fury. Turning ghastly white,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">while the light seemed to leap from her eyes, she exclaimed, in a low,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">deep, intense tone—</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“DEATH, sir! Do you threaten me? Insult me in my father’s house? Leave</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">it! You are unworthy to stand upon this floor! BEGONE!” And reaching out</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">her hand, she seized the bell cord, and rang a peal that presently</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">brought a servant to the door. The advent of a third party, though that</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">party was a menial, constrained the lady to remember herself. Miss</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Clifton was her cold, serene, dignified self again. Turning to the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">servant, she said, haughtily, “Show Captain Clifton to the front door,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">and bring round his horse, instantly. He returns to Hardbargain,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">to-night.” And she bowed to Clifton, and calmly and imperiously walked</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">from the room.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">The man stood waiting and bowing. Captain Clifton snatched his hat,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">saying—</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Let my horse be brought round, without delay, Dandy, and tell your</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">master, when he returns, that he shall hear from me at Hardbargain.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">When the man had bowed and retired, Captain Clifton passed out through</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">the open leaf of the window, into the piazza, and thence down into the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">lawn, to speak to Frank, who was just entering from the garden with Mrs.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Clifton on his arm.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Georgia saw at a glance, that her train of gunpowder had caught, and the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">magazine had blown up, and her dark, beautiful, demoniac, witching face</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">lighted up with a lurid joy for one unguarded instant, and then all was</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">self-recollection, self-control, and sweet, smooth, serene, alluring</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">glamour.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Bowing deeply to Mrs. Clifton, he said—</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Madam, an unexpected event sends me from Clifton this evening. Pray</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">make my adieus to my uncle and cousin. And permit me to commend my</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">friend here to your hospitable care until such time as he pleases to</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">become my guest at Hardbargain—if, indeed, he will not ride thither with</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">me to-night,” he added, turning to Frank.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Fairfax was too surprised to speak.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Mrs. Clifton, who was not surprised at all, yet affected much interest,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">said, archly—</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Oh, but we shall see you back very early to-morrow morning!”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“I regret to add, madam, that it is not likely,” he said, with another</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">bow; then turning to Frank, he asked—</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Will you ride with me to-night, Fairfax?”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Frank glanced at the lady on his arm, and then looking rebukingly at</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Clifton, begged to be excused.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Well, then, you are my guest, Fairfax, and my mother has often pressed</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">you to give her a few weeks of your company. Join me at Hardbargain as</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">soon as possible—the sooner the better. To-morrow even—”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“_To-morrow!_” archly smiled the wily lady. “_To-morrow_, I fancy, his</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">attendance and your own will be required _here_. Do you _forget_?—Well,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">that is the worst instance of absence of mind I ever saw or heard of! A</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">young bridegroom to forget, for an instant, his wedding-day! Too bad,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">even for _you_, the notoriously-absent-minded Archer Clifton!”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Not wishing to enter into explanations, Captain Clifton merely replied</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">with another bow—a most convenient, safe and polite manner of answer,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">since, without lack of courtesy, it committed nothing.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Then, taking leave of both lady and gentleman, and repeating his</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">invitation to Frank, he turned and went to take his horse from the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">servant that held it, threw himself up into the saddle, and, with a</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">parting wave of his hat, rode away at full speed.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Clifton looks darkly—what can be the matter?” asked Frank.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Oh, nothing! probably Mrs. Clifton, of Hardbargain, has been troubled</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">with some refractory servant, and has sent for her son to come up and</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">reduce him to order—or possibly there may be some dispute or difficulty</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">in settling the demands of the hired harvest hands. They are often even</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">dishonest in their extortions.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Deferring to your better judgment, madam, still, I fear not! I think</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">such trifles would scarcely have raised so dark a thunder-cloud upon</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Clifton’s brow,” said Frank.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Oh, well! At worst it is but some lover’s quarrel with his most</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">exacting queen, Carolyn!” playfully replied the lady.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Frank was not satisfied—he was pained. This most dangerous dark beauty</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">fascinated and frightened him by turns. He had never seen the fiend in</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">her face since that first night, and her witching power had almost</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">erased the remembrance of it from his mind. Indeed, if he had ever</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">recollected it, it was with wonder and remorse that he should have ever</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">read such fearful meaning in a lady’s frown, and he ascribed it to the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">phantasmagoria of his own fatigued nerves and over-excited brain. But</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">now he felt vaguely anxious, suspicious, foreboding—he scarce knew</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">wherefore. He had no reason to reply to the lady again, for at the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">instant she finished speaking, the carriages drove into the yard,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">bringing the company from Hardbargain, and they walked forward to</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">welcome them home.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>

<p class="p3"><span class="s2"><span class="Apple-converted-space">                          </span>THE SEVERED HEARTS.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2"><span class="Apple-converted-space">            </span>Alas! how slight a cause may move</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2"><span class="Apple-converted-space">            </span>Dissension between hearts that love—</span></p>

<p class="p3"><span class="s2"><span class="Apple-converted-space">            </span>That stood the storm when waves were rough,</span></p>

<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Some hours after the arrival of the company, old Mr. Clifton sat alone</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">in his study, examining piles of accounts, merchants’, mechanics’, and</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">hired laborers’ bills, that had come in as usual upon the first of July,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">many weeks before, yet had not, up to this night, been settled. For many</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">years past the financial affairs of the Master of Clifton had been</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">falling behindhand. The cause of this was that no plantation and</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">plantation house can thoroughly succeed without the personal</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">superintendence of an efficient _mistress_ to assist the master’s</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">effort. Often, indeed, it happens, that while the master himself is</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">engaged in state politics, or off at the legislature, or at congress, or</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">on the circuit as a judge of the court, or in the metropolis of the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">state, or of the nation, holding some high office under the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">government—the mistress, at home upon the plantation, is the main-spring</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">of all its business—superintending—not only the house and house-maids,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">with their multifarious cares and avocations, such as a city housewife</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">cannot conceive of, but managing the plantation also—keeping the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">overseer to his duty, adjudging equitably all difficulties that may</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">arise between him and the slaves under his charge—looking over all the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">numerous accounts, paying debts, and, when necessary, retrenching</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">expenses. Now the Clifton plantation had been singularly unfortunate in</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">a series of inefficient mistresses, even before it fell in regular</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">succession to the present Mr. Clifton. And after that, affairs were</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">worse than ever. His first wife, the haughty Miss Gower, the mother of</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Carolyn, was far too great a lady to look after a housekeeper and</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">overseer, and her successors had been all young girls, very worthless,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">except as pets and playthings, and who had, besides, to be indulged</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">every year with their winters in Richmond, or in Washington—a two-fold</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">evil, as it took the master from his plantation and men, and the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">mistress from her house and maids, and laid them, besides, under the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">heavy expense of city hotel living, dressing, dinner-giving, theatres,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">balls, concerts, etc. Once in awhile, as a bridal treat, or at the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">successive “coming out” of daughters, a winter in the metropolis may be</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">well enough. But when continued year after year, through a lifetime, to</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">the total neglect of the plantation, the revenues of no ordinary estate</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">will hold out. So it followed, that as the master and mistress ceased to</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">look after the overseer and the housekeeper, the overseer and</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">housekeeper ceased to look after the men and maids, and the men and</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">maids grew careless and indolent in the performance of their duties.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Thus, as the expenses rose, the income fell. And thus, at the present</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">time, old Mr. Clifton was almost irredeemably in debt, and all the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Clifton property, except the land, mortgaged to its full value. The</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">mortgage might foreclose at any instant. And at this present moment, the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">poor old master of great Clifton had not the ready money to pay his</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">harvest hands. The extent of his liabilities was, however, so little</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">known in the neighborhood, that his credit was still good, and almost</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">high—and the estate of White Cliffs was still considered as one of the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">most prosperous in the county, and the owners still held as very</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">enviable people. While old Mr. Clifton sat pondering most dismally over</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">his impracticable accounts, the study door was suddenly thrown open, and</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Miss Clifton entered, in great excitement, and threw herself into a</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">chair before her father, exclaiming—</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Father, I have been insulted!”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">The old man, never indifferent to his children’s cry—ever ready in the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">midst of his own real cares, to hear and sympathize even with their</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">fantastic griefs—looked up from his papers in perplexity, inquiring—</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“What is it? What did you say, my child?”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“I have been insulted!—outraged, sir!”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">The old man gazed at her in surprise, repeating—</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“‘Insulted, outraged!’”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Yes, sir! contemned, despised, scorned, insulted, outraged,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">_rejected_!”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">The old man placed his hands upon the arms of the chair and gazed in</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">astonishment, exclaiming—</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“‘Insulted!—outraged!’ Whom? You, my daughter Miss Clifton!</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">_Impossible._”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Yes, sir! me, your daughter—Carolyn Clifton!”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Who has presumed—who has dared—?”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Captain Clifton, sir, ‘has dared!’” replied the indignant beauty,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">rising in her excitement.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">The old gentleman stared at her in blank wonder for a minute, and</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">then—taking her hand—</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Sit down—sit down—sit down—sit down,” he kept repeating, “and tell me</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">all about it.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Carolyn drank a glass of ice water that stood near her on the table, and</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">then, in a cooler manner, told her father exactly what had passed, and</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">how it had finally ended.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">The old gentleman scratched his snow-white head in vexation and</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">perplexity, but the winter bloom of his broad, rosy face, was neither</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">heightened nor lowered at the hearing of the tale. He did not by any</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">means display the indignation the offended beauty had expected.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Well, sir!” at last she said, rather haughtily, “what do you say to</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">this?”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">He put his arm fondly around her waist, and drew her to him, saying,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">caressingly—</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“You’re a fool, Carolyn! A vain, jealous little fool, that’s all! Nay,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">now!—no airs with your old father! According to your own showing, it has</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">been Archer that has been ‘contemned, despised, scorned, insulted,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">outraged, rejected!’ and the rest of it—and upon no just grounds,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">either! as I can easily prove to you. I am very much mortified—deeply</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">humbled, indeed, to hear that my daughter, a highborn young maiden,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">should have forgotten her feminine pride and delicacy, and approached</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">her lover with an intimacy with a mountain-girl—a race of women, with</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">very few exceptions so low and wretched, that a young lady should ignore</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">their very existence. Oh, my conscience, Carolyn! why do you not cover</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">your face, and die with humiliation? I do not wonder a man of such high</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">honor and delicate sensibility as Archer Clifton, should have been</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">shocked and disgusted. Nay, my child!—no airs with me! No tossing of the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">head, and curling of the lip with me! I am your father. You must listen</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">to me. You have done Archer the most outrageous injustice. And your</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">jealousy is as ridiculous as it is indelicate. In the first place, this</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">girl, though brought up on the mountain, comes of respectable, if humble</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">parentage, and possesses, by all accounts, a higher toned moral and</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">intellectual nature than most young _ladies_ are endowed with. She is as</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">far removed from vice as my own Carolyn! In the second place, she is the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">protégé of _Mrs._ Clifton, as well as of Captain Clifton, and enjoys</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">that excellent lady’s esteem and friendship, spending half of every day</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">in her company, except when visitors are at the house. In the third and</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">last place, she is not a beautiful woman, but an ugly child—being</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">scarcely fourteen years of age, and having the ugliest face I ever saw</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">in my life—at least _I_ think so, though Mrs. Clifton says it is a noble</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">face. It has large features, and is full of strength and expression,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">like a boy’s. There, now, that’s all! Now! what do you think of</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">yourself?”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">During this short explanation, Carolyn’s beautiful countenance had</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">changed expression as rapidly and as variously as during the lay of the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">minstrel the harp changes and varies its notes. At its close she dropped</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">down by the side of the old man, and throwing her arms and her head upon</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">his knees, in utter weakness and dejection, sobbed—</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Father! how shall I _ever_ be forgiven?”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">He raised her to his knee, and putting his arm around her waist, drew</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">her head upon his bosom, and said—</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“It is an ugly lover’s quarrel, certainly, my love! And Archer Clifton</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">is as proud as you are! But it must be made up! It must be made up! A</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">very ugly quarrel, indeed. And on the eve of your marriage, too! But it</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">must be made up! It must be made up! Ah, doubtless he will be over</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">to-morrow night! He feels as bad as you do, I’ll warrant he does! I’ll</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">warrant he does! _I_ should, I know, if I were he!”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Ah, father! no he does not! He was in the right! I was in the wrong!”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Yes! you were wrong, Carry! And I hope it will be a lesson to you! But</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">that makes no difference in _his_ feelings, not a whit! He suffers as</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">much as you do! Why, when I have a difficulty with my poor little pet,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Georgia, if she is ever so wrong, and I ever so right, I am nevertheless</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">the most miserable man alive!”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Ah, father, but there is a great difference—I am not Archer’s pet, but</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">was to be his consort. We—Archer and myself, are nearly equal in</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">station, ay, education, disposition, and so are more responsible for our</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">conduct towards each other!” sighed Carolyn, dropping her head</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">dejectedly upon his bosom.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Oh, well! now if you are so full of doubts and fears! it is but ten</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">o’clock! I will mount my horse, and ride up to Hardbargain, and knock</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">the young gentleman up—I doubt if he is asleep!—and bring him back here,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">to-night!”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Not for the world! Not for ten thousand worlds!” exclaimed the proud</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">girl, vehemently.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Ah, then I don’t know what to do with you—go to bed, and try to sleep,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">and if you can’t do that, ring for the housekeeper, and make her give</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">you some of her nostrums, to put you to sleep! And go into a state of</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">non-existence, that shall obliterate the time between this and to-morrow</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">morning. And to-morrow, I’ll warrant Archer will be here to breakfast</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">with us, and to beg _your_ pardon for the sins that _you_ committed! for</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">that’s the end of all lovers’ quarrels! No matter who’s right and who’s</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">wrong—who’s sinned against, and who’s sinning, the gentleman has to do</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">the penance! There! kiss me, and be off with you!—and hark ye, Carolyn!</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">don’t forget to kneel down and pray Heaven to give you the grace of a</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">meeker temper!”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Carolyn Clifton went to her room and retired to bed, to heat her pillow</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">with her feverish head, to wet it with her hot tears—to sigh, and groan,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">and toss, and sob all night. This bitter, bitter quarrel, was the first</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">trouble the girl had ever had in all her favored life. And she was</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">impatient with it, indignant at it. She was angry with herself for her</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">injustice and indelicacy; angry with Clifton for not forcing upon her</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">the explanation she would not consent to receive, but which, had she</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">been forced to hear, would have arrested the quarrel, and saved this</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">cruel suffering; angry at the tedious night, that lingered so long,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">keeping her in agonizing suspense; angry at the morning, that delayed</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">its coming, and bringing her the peace and joy of a reconciliation. And</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">so she tossed, and groaned, and suffered, like one in high fever, while</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">the long, long night was slowly, slowly passing away.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2"><span class="Apple-converted-space">                  </span>* <span class="Apple-converted-space">      </span>* <span class="Apple-converted-space">      </span>* <span class="Apple-converted-space">      </span>* <span class="Apple-converted-space">      </span>*</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">In the meantime Captain Clifton had ridden away, not so angry as</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">shocked, repulsed and alienated by the unprecedented behaviour of his</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">lady-love. He disliked all demonstrations of emotion, and detested all</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">exhibitions of evil passion in a woman. It was the high-bred delicacy</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">and refinement—the queenly placidity—the cool reserve and stately</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">dignity of Carolyn Clifton, that had attracted his first admiration. And</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">though he sometimes gallantly complained of her cruelty, he would not</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">have had her manner one degree warmer. But now this fair, cool, peerless</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">queen o’er herself and her emotions, had yielded to passions that might</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">govern a serving-maid—to suspicion, jealousy, and fierce anger—had</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">descended to virulent, vituperative abuse! And, henceforth, she was</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">discrowned, and degraded from her pride of place.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">He arrived at Hardbargain—gave his horse in charge of a servant, and</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">entered the house.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">The candles were just lighted in the parlor, and Mrs. Clifton and her</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">favorite Kate sat sewing by the work-stand. As he entered, Kate arose as</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">usual with the intention of withdrawing, but he signed to her with his</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">hand, and said in a tone of command—</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“No—stay, Catherine, and once for all give up that habit of retiring as</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">soon as myself, or any other visitor enters.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">The young girl returned to her seat and resumed her work. Then with a</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">sort of spirit of persecution upon him, as one would think, he went to</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">the maiden and inquired, impatiently—</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“_Why_ do you always do that? _Why_ do you always rise and leave as soon</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">as any one enters the room?”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">She glanced up at him with those large, shy eyes, and instantly veiled</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">them again, while the blush deepened on her cheek. Her heart—her</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">disobedient, rebellious heart, that would not be calm when she bade</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">it—was beating fast against her bosom, as it ever beat, when he looked</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">at her, or spoke to her. To have saved her soul alive, she could not</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">have put her motive into words, and told him that she ever feared her</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">society, or even her presence, might not be as acceptable to Mrs.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Clifton’s visitors as it was to that kind lady herself. She only bowed</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">her head and blushed the deeper that she could not answer, and yet</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">deeper still, that she felt him gazing on her. He _was_ gazing on</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">her!—gazing down on that beautiful, dark auburn hair, rippling and</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">glittering under the light of the lamp—on that broad monarchal forehead,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">on those even eyebrows and long eyelashes, dropping fine shadows on the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">glowing cheek—yes! gazing and thinking of Major Cabell’s enthusiastic</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">admiration, and wondering why all the world did not agree with him in</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">thinking that countenance grandly beautiful! Yet even while admiring her</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">so much, he spoke angrily, and said—</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Catherine! You have a second habit even worse than the first! Lately</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">you have taken up the practice of not replying to me when I ask you a</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">question—and when you are obliged to raise your eyes to mine, you drop</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">them instantly as if mine burnt them. Now I have always disliked and</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">suspected eyes that cannot look freely into _other_ eyes!”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">At this the very forehead of the girl burned with a crimson flush.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Clifton took hold of her hand, which fluttered in his own like a</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">frightened bird, and said, in a kinder tone—</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Come, my child! see now if you can look me honestly in the face, and</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">tell me why you will not talk to me?”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">But Kate’s distress became so great that Mrs. Clifton interposed, and</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">said—</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“_Do_, Archer, leave her alone! It does seem to me, son, that you take a</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">malicious pleasure in tormenting that poor girl because she is so shy!</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Don’t mind him, Kate! He has been a tease ever since he was a boy, when</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">he used to pull the ears of kittens and puppy dogs. Take up your work,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">child, and hurry on with it. And you, Archer! I am as much surprised as</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">pleased to see you back here to-night. To what am I indebted for the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">pleasure?”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“My dear mother, I will tell you after awhile—let me be quiet now a</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">little time.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">And Mrs. Clifton looked up in surprise, and noticed, for the first time,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">how deeply troubled was Archer Clifton’s face. After watching him a few</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">minutes as he sat and watched Kate, she said, suddenly—</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Oh! I have a letter for you—arrived by the afternoon mail. Henry</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">brought it from the post-office this evening after you left. Perhaps it</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">was in quest of that you came, and its contents may dispel your</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">uneasiness,” and rising, the lady went to the card rack, hanging above</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">the mantle-piece, and brought him a letter, which he tore open and read</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">hastily. Then starting up, he exclaimed, “Good! Good! Most excellent,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">most opportune!”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“What is it, my dear Archer? I am very glad it gives you such</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">satisfaction, at any rate! What is it?”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“An order from head-quarters to join my regiment immediately, to take</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">command of a detachment to march within ten days for the Indian</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">frontier—to put down an insurrection there!”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“No!” exclaimed the lady, in amazement.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Yes, indeed, my good mother!” replied Archer Clifton, exultingly.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“_No!_ You astonish me! Ordered upon active duty—upon distant and</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">dangerous service at the very time you are about to be married! Call you</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">that opportune—fortunate? I call it most _in_opportune, _un_fortunate!”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Ah! madam, you do not know! What, and if my marriage were already</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">broken off! Is it not lucky—I mean providential, that I can join my</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">regiment immediately, and depart for a distant scene, and active</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">service, in which I may forget the sorrow and the humiliation!”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Your marriage broken off? What? Now, at the last moment? A marriage</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">that has been looked forward to for so many years? To be broken off when</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">every thing is ready! Impossible, it cannot be!”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“I assure you upon my word, madam, it is but too true!”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Why—what—_do_ you tell me?” exclaimed the lady, in increasing</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">astonishment. “When did it happen? What caused it? Had Mr. Clifton</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">anything to do with it?”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“It happened this evening after my return to Clifton. Mr. Clifton had</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">nothing whatever to do with it—not having reached home at the time it</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">occurred. It was occasioned by a most humiliating quarrel between myself</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">and Miss Clifton!”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Oh, a quarrel! A lovers’ quarrel! That is nothing! Though, in truth, it</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">surprises me that the calm, proud Carolyn should descend to such a</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">thing, as it does that my own son should deign to take a part in it. But</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">it is really nothing! Such things occur in almost every courtship!”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“And those who quarrel in courtship should never venture upon</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">matrimony.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Ah! that is an inhuman, unfaithful sentiment, my son! Young people are</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">like other young natures, petulant, vain, irascible, exacting—but life</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">trains them into modesty, sobriety, forbearance. For this quarrel,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Archer, it must be adjusted! It shall be to-morrow morning!”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“No, madam, it shall not! This quarrel is irreconcilable, believe me!”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Pooh, pooh! _What! with Carolyn?_ Nonsense!”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Mother! you shall judge! She has descended from her high place of</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">maidenly pride and delicacy, and betraying the most revolting phases of</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">suspicion, jealousy and fierce anger she has charged me with infidelity,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">base treachery and vice!”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Dreadful! dreadful! as all angry words and acts ever are! _But not</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">unpardonable!_ Spoken in the frenzy of passion—they will be retracted</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">to-morrow! And then you must be reconciled. Things must go on as they</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">have been planned. There must be no discreditable exposure of this</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">affray. The marriage must take place, as proposed, to-morrow evening.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Then, if you _must_ join your regiment, why it will be easily</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">_understood_ that you must. And there will be no reproach under those</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">circumstances in leaving your newly wedded bride under her father’s</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">protection!”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Impossible, madam! Miss Clifton has to-night exhibited her character</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">and disposition in such revolting colors, that I can never, never take</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">her to my bosom!”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“You are angry now, Archer! You will think better of it! I trust in</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Heaven you may do so before there is an exposure. Think what will be the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">astonishment of the wedding-company who will assemble to-morrow</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">evening—the mortification of the family at Clifton, and worse than all,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">the scandal! the nine days wonder!”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“I thought my dear mother had too strong a mind to fear these bugbears</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">of the little, when a just occasion for meeting and braving them</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">occurs.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“But I do not consider this an adequate occasion. That this quarrel will</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">be finally adjusted, I firmly believe. And I think it a pity and a shame</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">that to-morrow evening, three hundred guests should be disappointed and</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">dispersed, to spread a subject of speculation and scandal all over the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">country. And this merely because you will yet a little longer indulge</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">your anger!”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“I am not angry, mother. If I were only angry I should let the marriage</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">go on, if Miss Clifton thought proper to do so, for I should know that</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">my anger would pass away. No, I am not angry, mother, but shocked,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">repulsed, and totally estranged. I could no more marry Miss Clifton now,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">than I could take any other loathed object to my bosom! The idea makes</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">me shudder!”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Still I affirm that all this is intense anger, nothing else, and that</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">there will come a reaction. Why in anger, Archer, the object is as much</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">loathed as in love it is desired—but _that_ is temporary, and _this_, I</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">hope, you will find permanent. I hope, at bottom, you respect Carolyn?</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">_I esteem_ her. She has been a spoiled child, but has so many</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">undeveloped good qualities, that she only wants the discipline of a</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">little affection to make her a very excellent woman. I shall say no more</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">about this affair to-night, but wait to see what disposition I shall</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">find you in to-morrow!”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">At this moment there was a knock at the door, and instantly afterwards</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Henny came in and informed her mistress that Mr. Kavanagh had come to</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">take his sister home.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Ask Mr. Kavanagh to sit down in the hall. Put up your sewing,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Catherine, my dear!” said the lady.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Catherine arose to fold up her work, while Captain Clifton looked very</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">much as if he would like to stop her again.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Does she not remain with you at night, madam?”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Certainly not—her brother always comes for her at bedtime.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“How early does she come in the morning?”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“She never comes in the morning. Catherine has her own domestic affairs</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">to attend to during the forenoon. She never gets here till late in the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">afternoon.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Then I shall not see her to-morrow—not see her again for many</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">months—perhaps _never_ see her again! Come here, Catherine!”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Catherine came to his side, and stood, as usual, with her eyes fixed</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">upon the ground, and her cheek painfully flushed. He took her hand and</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">pressed it in his own, while he said—</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Catherine! you have heard all that passed between myself and Mrs.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Clifton, this evening?”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">A quick, short, but not ungraceful nod was all her answer.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“And you know that I am going away on a distant and dangerous service; I</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">leave here very early in the morning—I may never come back, Catherine,”</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">he said, slowly, looking at her steadily.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Her hand in his grew cold—her cheek paled—her heart stopped still as</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">death—but no word did she speak in reply.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Catherine! before I go, I intend to give you a command—do you hear me?”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">A spasmodic nod was her reply.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“I may be gone many years. In the meanwhile you will grow up to</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">womanhood, Catherine; do not have any lovers—_beaux_—as young girls call</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">them, while I am away—and above all things, do not choose a husband</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">without first consulting me through my mother.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Not knowing what to reply to this, Catherine remained perfectly silent.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Will you obey me in this, girl?” he asked, rather impatiently.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">A low, earnest choking “Yes sir,” was her answer.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Kiss me, then! for I may never return,” said Archer Clifton, folding</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">her for one moment to his bosom, and pressing a kiss upon her full lips.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">But her lips grew cold at the touch—her face paled and fell away from</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">his bosom—her form drooped and sank back over his arm, where she lay</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">like one dead, in a swoon.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Surprised, alarmed, Clifton raised her in both arms, and hastened to the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">lounge, where he laid her, calling to his mother. The lady came forward</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">without any trepidation, and bringing a bottle of Hungary water, began</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">to chafe her temples and face, and finally gave that task to Clifton,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">while she herself loosened Kate’s dress.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“What could have been the cause of this, mother? Is she subject to these</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">attacks?”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“I never knew her to faint before, though I have seen her under very</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">trying circumstances with that old man, her grandfather.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“What could have occasioned it?”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Why, the sudden news of your going away on dangerous service, of</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">course,” said Mrs. Clifton, as she resumed the bottle, and continued to</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">chafe the girl’s face and hands. “The child loves you, Archer; she has a</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">very grateful, affectionate heart, and very strong feelings. She loves</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">us both. And when you bade her good-bye, for a long and perilous</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">absence, is it strange she should have been overcome? When _soldiers_</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">talk of danger, _children_ may be forgiven for being frightened. Do go</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">and tell Kavanagh that Kate must remain here to-night, and dismiss him.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">He went, and before he came back again, Kate, with a long drawn sigh,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">had opened her eyes and recovered.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“You must raise her, and take her up stairs, my dear Archer. She must</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">suffer no more agitation to-night,” said Mrs. Clifton.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">And he lifted the form of Catherine, and took her up stairs, while his</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">mother called Henny. When they had laid the young girl on a bed, and</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">left her to the care of Henny, and had returned to the parlor</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">again—Captain Clifton said—</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Mother! take care of that girl! She has been the innocent, unconscious</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">cause of my trouble to-day, but I cannot feel dislike or even</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">indifference towards her. Take care of that humble maiden, mother, as if</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">she were your daughter and my sister. Don’t let any rustic beaux come</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">near her, mother. I cannot endure the idea of her marrying, or even</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">being wooed by any low, miserable fellow of her brother’s grade. And do</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">not permit any young gentleman of the neighborhood to trifle with her</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">heart, or endanger her good name. You know how easily, even without her</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">fault, that sole possession of a poor maiden is lost. The thought that</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">such an unmerited misfortune should befall Kate, exasperates me beyond</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">measure, and I feel like quarreling with the whole order of society!”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“What, you! the proud conservator of rank! Truly Archer, one would think</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Carolyn _had some little ground_ of complaint!” said the lady, with her</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">little, low, half dignified, half jolly laugh.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“This from _you_ mother!” exclaimed Archer Clifton, reproachfully. “I</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">thought you knew me better. You _do_ know me better! But I must have</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">some hand in this girl’s good fortune.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Mrs. Clifton, who was walking about the room, quietly setting things in</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">order for the night, made no reply, but only smiled. And soon after she</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">lighted a night lamp, and placing it in the hand of her son, bade him</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">good-night, and retired to her chamber. Captain Clifton remained pacing</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">up and down the room, in troubled thought, some time after she had left,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">before seeking his own couch.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>

<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Morning came at length. Carolyn Clifton arose unrefreshed, weak, dizzy</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">and sick. This was the first night’s rest she had ever lost in her life.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">And on looking in the glass—habitually the first thing the beauty ever</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">did after rising—she was shocked to see what havoc one night’s evil</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">passions had made in her appearance. What a fright she had become! How</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">pale her cheeks, how dragged the muscles, how red, dim, and sunken her</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">eyes! And this upon her wedding-day—and when she had a quarrel to make</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">up with her intended husband, too! When, in fine, every circumstance</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">pressingly demanded that she should appear in the highest beauty. Would</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Archer Clifton—would that fastidious, artistic worshiper of the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">beautiful—feel inclined to a reconciliation with such a spectre as</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">herself, she mentally inquired, as she gazed wonderingly, deploringly,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">upon her haggard face? Carolyn was vain and proud and scornful—so vain</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">and proud and scornful that she did not know—could not imagine that that</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">very haggard face—haggard with sorrow for the estrangement and the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">separation, would be a stronger appeal, make a deeper impression upon</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">the heart of her lover, than all the glory of her beauty had ever done.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">And thus vanity, pride and scorn punish their subject, not only by</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">depriving her of very much respect and affection she would otherwise</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">have, but by making her insensible of that love and esteem that really</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">does surround her.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Carolyn at length rang for her woman. And after some little delay she</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">came in, evidently just aroused up out of her sleep, and wondering that</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">her young mistress should summon her before sunrise. But as soon as she</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">saw her lady, her wonder gave way to alarm, and she exclaimed—</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“My good gracious alive, Miss Carolyn! What’s der matter, honey?”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Has——_any one_ arrived this morning, Aunt Darky?” inquired Miss</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Clifton, without noticing the old woman’s alarm.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“No, chile, sure not! Who should ribe at dis onlikely hour ob de mornin?</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Ledst it war de doctor. Has you sent for de doctor, honey? But Lord,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">indeed, chile, you better lay down agin. Don’t keep on standin’ dere</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">holdin’ up your hair, weak as you looks, an’ I’ll run an’ see!”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Aunt Darky, I am not ill. I have had a bad night’s rest—that’s all.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Go—and—”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“A bad night’s res’, an’ like enough, honey! I had a _berry_ bad night’s</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">res’ de night afore, me an’ Old Nick took up ’long o’ each oder! ’Deed</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">chile, I was sort o’ scared an’ sorter happy, ’cause I _was_ scared! An’</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">deed, chile, ‘tween so many con_try_dictions, I could’n onderstan’</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">myself and kept awake all night! Lord, honey, it’s nat’ral! We’s all</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">alike, ’cept ’tis de collor, an’ dat’s only outside show, skin deep. But</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">bless you, honey, that wan’t nothin’ to the night ’resses I’se lost</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">since dat, with long o’ cryin’ babies an’ teethin’ babies, an’ sick</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">chillun, an’ ole man Nick comin’ home drunk ebery time ole Marse give</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">him any holyday money to spen’ on hisself! Now praise be de Lor’, de</span></p>

<p class="p3"><span class="s2">An’ I tell my galls how I ain’ gwine be bother’ long o’ _der_ chillun,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">now in my ole days!”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Aunt Darky,” said Miss Clifton, feeling in no way flattered by the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">parallel, “go and get my bath ready, and have a cup of strong coffee</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">brought the instant I leave it.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Yes, honey—an’ hadn’t de baff’s water better have de air tuk off o’ it,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">as you’se not so strong dis mornin’?”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Yes, yes—what makes you trouble me by questions? You ought to know what</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">is proper to be done.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“An’ so I allus does know, honey—ony when I does my mos’ properess’, you</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">doesn’n alluz’ see it into dat light an you fines fau’rt long o’ me,”</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">said the old body, as she left the room.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">When Miss Clifton had left her warm bath, and had partaken of the rich</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">strong coffee—strong as the essence of coffee, and made rich and thick</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">by being half cream and sugar, and brought to her in a tiny porcelain</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">cup, she felt sufficiently refreshed to be able, with the assistance of</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">her woman, to make her morning toilet.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">When she had finished dressing it was still very early, and two hours</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">remained before breakfast—but she left her room, and met her father, who</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">was an early riser, in the upper hall.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">He came forward and kissed her. Then held both her hands, and looked in</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">her face, exclaiming—“What! pale, my child? Oh, tut! tut! tut! tut! tut!</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">That’s _all_ wrong! All wrong!”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Father! has he come yet?”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“No, no—it’s quite early yet! He’ll be here anon! You should not have</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">risen these two hours!”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Father, I could not sleep! I could not even lie in bed!”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Oh, pooh! pooh! pooh! All folly! All nonsense! Go back and rest.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Father, I cannot! My words to him were so wrong! so bitter! so</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">insulting! I feel them to have been such, and I can never rest until I</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">have told him so!” said Carolyn, dropping her head upon the only bosom</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">to which her haughty heart could bear to confide its sorrow and its</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">repentance.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Well, so you were wrong, very wrong! It will teach you a lesson that</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">will benefit you for the future. And for the present it will blow over.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">There, there, there—if you can’t be still, go and amuse yourself by</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">making me a nice mint-julep! I want it before I go out in the fields—the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">morning air on my empty stomach isn’t good for me.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">He then kissed Carolyn and let her go. As she left him, he saw to his</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">surprise Frank Fairfax emerge from his chamber, with a portmanteau in</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">his hand. Frank immediately set it down, and advancing, said—</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Ah, sir! I was just about to seek you, to let you know that, to my</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">infinite regret, I must leave you to-day.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“To-day? You astound me! What is up now? You mustn’t go—you shan’t!”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Sir, I have received an order to join my regiment without delay!”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Oh-h-h, that’s bad! That’s bad! Devil fly away with military life!</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">That’s what was always hiking away Archer at the very time I wanted him</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">most. But no frantic hurry! You needn’t go to-day! You _mustn’t_. Why,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">this is the wedding-day, you rascal!”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“I know it, sir! But, to my everlasting regret, I must forego the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">pleasure of being present upon that occasion. My order is a peremptory</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">one, to join my regiment instantly.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Well, well! To-morrow’ll do! To-morrow’ll do! _One_ day cannot make so</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">much difference!”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“My dear sir, I surely need not tell you that soldiers should be ‘minute</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">men’ in their obedience. Besides, if I do not seize the opportunity of</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">meeting the Staunton stage as it passes through L—— to-night, I shall</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">have to wait three days for the next stage. So, you see—”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Yes, yes; I see! I am always called upon to see something I don’t want</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">to see! Ah! here comes the mint-julep! Did Miss Carolyn mix it?”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">This was addressed to the colored boy who brought a pint tumbler on a</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">little waiter.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Yez, zur,” said the boy.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Do you take julep in the morning, Frank? Try this. Another julep for</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">me, Nace!”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“No, no, I thank you, sir! I never do. I wish you good-morning till</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">breakfast time,” said Frank, taking up his portmanteau, and going down</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">stairs.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Frank put his little burden down in the lower hall, and went into the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">summer saloon, where he was sure, by the precedent of the last thirty</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">days, of finding Zuleime at the window, doing her sampler-work. Yes,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">there she was, in her white muslin and coral, with her jet black hair</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">and damask cheeks! He went and sat down by her, (after saying</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Good-morning,”) and sat for some minutes in perfect silence, watching</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Zuleime work the word Love, in crimson silk. At length—</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Whom do _you_ love best in the world, Zuleime?” he asked.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“How can you ask? Whom does _everybody_ love best?—‘her nain sell,’ as</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">the Welchman says, of course!” exclaimed the merry maiden.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Humph! Well, whom do you love the _next_ best to yourself?”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Why, let me see,” said the girl, pausing thoughtfully, with her needle</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">poised in her hand; “I think, that next to myself, I love—Zuleime</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Clifton best of all the world!”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“I thought so! And I can lay my hand upon my heart, and say, that you</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">don’t love Zuleime Clifton a whit better than I do!—no, nor half so</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">well! I’ll throw down my gage on that, and fight it out to extremity!</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Come!—What have you to say to that?” asked the young man, with all the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">earnestness in his face and manner that his light words wanted—“say,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">speak! What do you say to that?”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Why, that you are as foolish as Zuleime herself, in loving such a</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">little, out-of-the-way baggage, that is neither woman nor child, nor</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">good nor bad, nor any thing else in particular.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Well, at any rate, we both agree in loving and worshiping Zuleime,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">however we may differ in our opinion of her—_I_, for instance, thinking</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">her a beautiful, joyous, delightful girl. So, it’s settled, isn’t it?”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“What is settled?”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Oh, you know, you tease!”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“I know the weather is settled, if you mean _that_!”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Pooh!”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“I _don’t_ know that the naval trouble with Great Britain is settled, if</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">you mean _that_!”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Pooh, pooh!”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“I know that the marriage dower of thirty thousand dollars is settled</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">upon Carolyn, if you mean that!”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Pooh, pooh, pooh!”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Well, I shall not try to guess again, lest you should say, ‘Pooh, pooh,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">pooh, _pooh_!’—four times!”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Zuleime!” said the young man, earnestly, “I think, without presumption,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">I may say that I know your disposition towards me. Zuleime, I wish that</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">we should pass all our lives together, side by side! I would like to</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">open my heart and bid you look into it and read for yourself. I hate to</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">say, ‘I love you,’ (though if you could look into my heart!) Oh, that</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">phrase, ‘I love you,’ Zuleime, is so fallen, is so prostituted, so</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">degraded from its high meaning—‘I love you’ so often means ‘I need your</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">wealth,’ ‘need your family influence,’ ‘I desire your delightful</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">beauty!’ Oh, Zuleime, dearest girl, how then shall I express my true,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">sincere, earnest devotion to you?”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“You needn’t—I know you like me, Frank,” murmured Zuleime, very low. And</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">then she added, lower still—“But I am nothing but a wild school-girl,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">and, seriously, I fear it isn’t right for me to listen to such words for</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">years to come yet. And I fear father might not like it, only that he</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">likes _you_ so very well.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">And Zuleime bent over her sampler, diligently, commencing the next word,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">hope, in azure silk.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“I know it, Zuleime! Dear, candid girl, I know it all—all the seeming</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">error! But, Zuleime, I am going away to-day,” (she looked up in</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">surprise,) “and I may be gone for several years. When I come back I</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">shall certainly return a captain, if not probably a major, or possibly a</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">colonel. Before I go, I wish to have a fair understanding with yourself</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">and your father, so that I may go away with some feeling of security. I</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">want you both to promise that when I return you will give me your hand.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“You may speak to father, Frank. But I tell you frankly now, what I wish</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">you had heard before. It is this:—that I have been promised to my grim</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">cousin, Major Cabell, ever since I can remember anything. And till you</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">came, I have always, whenever I have anticipated the future at all,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">looked forward to being his hum-drum wife, and living in a grim</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">three-story red brick, in a row, and opposite another row of stiff,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">prison-like red brick houses, each one of which, taken singly, is more</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">dreary than all the rest. I didn’t like the prospect, Frank; but I</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">thought it was my fate, and the best father could do for me, and so I</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">thought of no other possibility but the grim red brick house in the city</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">and Major Cabell. Besides, father is so good a father, and so fond and</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">indulgent, that it seemed _too_ wicked to think of disappointing his</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">gentle wishes, that never take the form of commands. And so, Frank,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">although whenever I would think of the grim brick house, with tall dark</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">chambers, and the narrow, stony, distracting street before it, and Major</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Cabell, my heart would sink very heavy, and I would think, young as I</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">was, that there was scarcely any hope for me at all—yet, I would</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">recollect my dear good father wished it, and I would pluck up my spirits</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">and feel blithe as a bird again. It was all understood at the school</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">where I am getting finished, as they call it. And father left word that</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Major Cabell should be admitted to visit me. So when I am there he comes</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">to visit me frequently, and takes me out riding, or driving, and to</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">concerts. And the girls whisper together, and say that I am engaged—”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Stop—stop—stop—stop! Pardon me, Zuleime! Pardon me, dear girl! But, I</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">am giddy—indeed, I am ill! Have you yourself promised to marry him?”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“No, surely not; and that is the reason why I consider myself in some</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">sort _free_—but of my duty to my good father. No, he has never even</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">asked me. He considers my father’s promise quite sufficient, and our</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">marriage quite a matter of course. And so I used to consider it, too.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">These things are often done, Frank. These betrothals, I mean. Any one</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">might suppose the custom obsolete—having died in the dark ages. It is</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">not. It prevails here to a considerable extent. It is done to keep</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">family property together, or family interest closely cemented. And,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Frank, he has never courted me yet. You see he considers me a child</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">still. And so I am, compared to him, in years. And so I should be, in</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">all things, a child, but that the shadow of that grim brick house is</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">always falling on my heart!”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“And yet, with all this, you are a very, very merry maiden!”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Yes, so I am. I try to be! I keep a din up in my head to prevent me</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">hearing what my heart wants to say! Goodness! I can do nothing for the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">poor thing, you know, and what’s the use of stopping to listen to its</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">cry?—_that_ would only encourage it to complain the more. Don’t look so</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">sorry, Frank! It is not all effort! It could not be, you know. I’m</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">naturally of a glad, elastic temper; and but for this drawback, Heaven</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">knows what I should be! the wildest, maddest, most harem-scarem, most</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">heels-over-head, skip-over-the-moon madcap that ever turned a quiet home</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">topsy-turvy, and drove a quiet family to distraction! The Bible</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">says,—‘God loveth whom He chasteneth, and scourgeth every son (and</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">daughter) whom He receiveth.’ Then I think, (I _do_ think, sometimes,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">young and volatile as I am,) I think that every one whom God redeems has</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">_some_ sorrow, and that sorrow is always the precise one fitted to cure</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">their besetting sin! As the proud are still kept down by poverty and</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">oppression, the vain lose their charms, or the power of enhancing them,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">etc., etc., etc., among all the erring whom God designs to set right.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">And I, who am naturally so wild and thoughtless, must be sobered and</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">made thoughtful by the prospect of that prison before me!”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Zuleime, does this man love you?”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Frank, if I say he does not _hate_ me, it is the extent of all</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">favorable things I can say about the state of his mind towards me. No,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">he does not love me. It is entirely a betrothal of convenience.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Sometimes I look forward to my future life in that great unknown city,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">which I should dislike under any circumstances, and especially to pass</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">my whole life in, with one I do not like, and who does not like me, and</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">I _wonder_ how I shall contrive to exist,—_I_, who love to be in the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">country, on this dear old homestead, with my fond old father and my</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">tender old nurse, and the colored folks who love me so well,—and where I</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">have so many occupations,—and, oh, my soul and body! I think how _shall_</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">I ever put life through in that packed up city! Sometimes I think—for I</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">_must_ have something to occupy my whole soul with—that I will be very</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">gay and worldly, and dress, and visit, and give balls, and go to balls,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">and theatres; but then again I reflect that it would be wicked to spend</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">all one’s time and attention upon such things. And then I think I shall</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">try to grow serious enough to join a church, and that I will be a</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">leading member, and a Sunday School teacher, and a patroness of the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Bible Society, and of the Missionary Society, and a getter-up of new</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">kinds of benevolent associations, and Dorcas circles, and be a Committee</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">woman, and a distributor of tracts, and a collector of subscriptions,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">etc. One _must_ do _something_ to fill up the long, long days; one</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">_must_ live _somehow_, and, upon the whole, I thought this latter plan</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">might do, as it would occupy me entirely, and is not so wicked as the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">other.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Ah, I don’t know that, Zuleime! But, my dearest girl, cease all these</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">troubled thoughts about the future, unnatural to your age, and</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">unwholesome to yourself! This whole cloud must be swept away like a</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">cobweb. He doesn’t love you. You don’t love him. He has never asked you</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">to marry him. You have never promised to do so. It is a mere betrothal</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">of convenience, made by the parents of both for the purpose of keeping</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">family property together, and cementing family interests. Oh, it is all</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">wrong! And there is nothing in it! I will speak to your father. I will</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">enter the lists with this Major Cabell, as a competitor for your hand.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">In all worldly circumstances, which are ever of the greatest value in a</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Clifton’s estimation—in family, wealth and social position, I am his</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">peer. Besides, I wear my lady’s favor, which he does not! I will go to</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">your father now and tell him as much, shall I, Zuleime?”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">The young lady was busy threading her needle with golden yellow silk,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">and did not answer. He repeated the question.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Yes,” murmured Zuleime, beginning to embroider the last word of the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">trio,—Faith,—in sunbeam silk. No time was to be lost. He raised her hand</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">to his lips, and darted out upon the lawn to meet old Mr. Clifton, whom</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">he saw approaching the house.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“My dear sir!” exclaimed Mr. Fairfax, rather excitedly. “I have</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">something of the utmost importance to say to you. Will you take a turn</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">with me?”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“My dear sir!” repeated the old gentleman, smiling, “breakfast is ready!</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Let’s go on to the house!”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“But my _dear_ sir! my business is urgent!”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“My _very_ dear sir! the coffee is getting cold!” said the old man,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">laughing at Frank’s excitement.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Mr. Clifton,” said the young man, gravely and sadly, “immediately after</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">breakfast I must leave here. This, then, is the only opportunity I have</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">or shall have of communicating to you what is on my heart to say—and it</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">really _is_ on my _heart_.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Say on then, my dear boy! say on!” exclaimed the benevolent old</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">gentleman. But Frank, now that he had got leave to speak, was struck</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">dumb. He thought it was perfectly easy and simple to ask for Zuleime,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">but now the request, like Macbeth’s amen, stuck in his throat. “Come,”</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">said the old gentleman, running his fat arm through Frank’s slender one,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“give me the support of your arm, for I am not so young and active as</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">you are, and let us take a little walk up the path towards Hardbargain.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Perhaps we may meet Archer, and bring him back with us to breakfast. He</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">is not at the _house_, is he?”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“No, sir,” said Frank, glad to recover the use of his tongue.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“We expect him here to breakfast. We shall probably meet him. Come!</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Well, now! what is it?” he asked, as they turned their backs on the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">house.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Frank had plucked up his courage, and now spoke to the purpose.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Mr. Clifton, as I am going away immediately after breakfast, and as I</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">am to be absent for an indefinite length of time, I wish before I leave</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">to tell you that which lies upon my heart—” here he paused a little time</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">to collect his thoughts and fine words, while the old gentleman attended</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">with an encouraging expression of countenance. Frank resumed—“Mr.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Clifton, I love your daughter Zuleime. And I have come to beg your</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">sanction to our engagement!” As the old man only said, “Whew-w-w-w!”</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Frank continued—“You know my rank in the army, and my prospect of</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">promotion. You are acquainted with my family, and are aware of their</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">interest and influence in the country. Allow me farther to add, that my</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">own private fortune amounts to fifty thousand dollars. And I will settle</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">thirty thousand on my bride. Besides which—”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Stay, stay—my _dear_ fellow, stay!” interrupted the old man, with a</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">troubled look. “This is all nonsense, now! Zuleime is a child. And you</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">have not known her more than six weeks. Love Zuleime! Pooh, pooh! You</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">young men are so flighty and fickle in your fancies! You get frantic</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">about every new face you see, and think yourselves in love! Pooh, pooh!</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Now, Frank, my boy, come! let’s hear no more of it! It’s all nonsense!</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">You young officers are always in love, or fancying yourselves so! I dare</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">say, you have been in love with all the daughters of all your</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">commanders, and Heaven forefend, a little platonically smitten with all</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">their wives, too! Come, I know you! Nonsense! Let’s hear no more of it!”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Mr. Clifton, I am no trifler in matters of the affections. I never</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">_have_ been. I never _shall_ be, I hope! And when I tell you, upon my</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">sacred honor, that never in my life have I ‘flirted,’ as it is called,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">with a woman—that never in my life have I either loved or addressed the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">language of love to a woman—except Zuleime—you will believe me!”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“_Oh-h-h-h!_” exclaimed the old gentleman, with an exceedingly bored</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">look. “It’s all _folly_, all _nonsense_, I tell you! A sudden fancy!</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Nothing more! Let’s drop the subject.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Mr. Clifton,” said the young man, gravely and sorrowfully, for he saw</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">that the old gentleman rather evaded than denied or accepted his suit,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“I have never, in my whole life, been addicted to taking sudden and</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">evanescent fancies, as you might judge, from what I told you! And when I</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">tell you that I love your daughter Zuleime, I mean that I love her</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">sincerely and earnestly, with my whole heart and soul—and that I shall</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">love her to the last hour of my life!”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Bah! bah! It’s all _tom-foolery_, I tell you! You get yourself shut up</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">in a country house with a pretty girl, and _of course_ you fall in love</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">with her! _To be sure!_ What else could you do? It’s expected of you!</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">You’d disappoint us if you didn’t! But it is such love as will not</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">outlast your journey to your regiment.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“It will outlast my life! I know it will! I feel it will!” said Frank,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">earnestly, vehemently.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Tah! tah! tah!—you’ll fall desperately in love with the first pretty</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">squaw of the friendly tribes who shall come to bring moccasins to your</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">frontier fort!”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Oh, God!” groaned the young man, bitterly, dropping his face into his</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">hands. “There is no way of making a serious impression upon you, and I</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">am going away in two hours!” His tone and manner so affected the really</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">impressible and benevolent old gentleman, that he half embraced him with</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">his fat arm, saying—</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Now _don’t_, Frank! _Do_ be a good boy! _Don’t! Do!_ It’s all _folly_</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">now! _Indeed_ it is! _Do! Don’t!_ Now consider—how many pretty girls</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">there are in the world! _Don’t_, Frank! A great deal prettier than my</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">girl. Never fret about her. _Do_, Frank. Besides, she’s so young! A mere</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">school-girl. Only fifteen last Monday. Pooh, pooh! Not to be thought of,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">you know! Far too young!”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Sir, I can wait. I only wish your sanction to our engagement. I can</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">wait three or four years, if necessary, or any length of time at all, if</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">I may hope to get her at last!”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“She is too _young_, I tell you, Frank! Too young to know her own mind.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Only fifteen. Ridiculous!”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“But, sir, I have heard of gentlemen older and more settled than myself</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">who have actually _married_ girls of fifteen. _I_ only ask an</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">engagement!”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“You mean _me_, you dog! I know you do! I see you do! But, Frank,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">seriously and solemnly, I wouldn’t do so again! And for the very reason</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">that _I_ committed that egregious folly, that bitter wrong against a</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">young girl, I will not suffer any one else to do the same wrong to my</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">child, if I can help it!”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“No, Mr. Clifton—pardon me, but are _you_ not about to commit a more</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">grievous wrong to your own lovely, gentle child? Have you not? Pardon</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">me! Pardon me! But _have_ you not promised her hand where she cannot</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">give her heart?”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“No! Heaven forbid! I promised her to Charley Cabell. She used to like</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">him very well. I did the best I could for her happiness. I have secured</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">it—unless—unless—oh, my God, Frank!” suddenly exclaimed the old man, in</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">his turn extremely agitated, and wiping the perspiration from his brow,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“I _hope_—I _trust in God_ you haven’t entrapped her affections! Frank!</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Frank! She _is_ engaged to Major Cabell! I didn’t tell you so when you</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">first asked me for her, because—because—for many reasons—” (wiping the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">streaming perspiration from his brow) “it is—it is—disagreeable to</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">remember and to talk about it! But—but—she _is_ engaged to Major Cabell,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">and—and for many reasons—family reasons—it is necessary that the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">engagement should be fulfilled! Unless—unless—some inevitable,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">_insurmountable obstacle_ was to arise and prevent it! Frank! Frank! I</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">am in a great strait! a dire, doleful strait! but—but—sooner than make</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">my girl _un_happy, or stand in the way of her perfect happiness, I</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">would—I would—I would _die in a jail_! Where I may die! Where I may</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">die!” Nothing could exceed the force of the emotion that agitated the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">old man, shaking his huge form, and choking up his utterance.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Mr. Fairfax looked at him with mingled astonishment, wonder and</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">compassion.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Boy—boy—you _haven’t_ entrapped my dear child’s heart?” again inquired</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">the old gentleman, trembling with excess of feeling.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“_Entrapped_ is not exactly the word, sir,” said Frank, proudly and</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">mournfully. “I learned to love her, and I won her love without designing</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">to do either!”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Lost! Lost!” cried Mr. Clifton, dropping his head upon his bosom. He</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">walked on in silence so desponding, that Fairfax could not bring himself</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">to intrude upon it. They went on until they suddenly met _Major Cabell</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">himself_ coming down the hill, apparently from Hardbargain.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">The Major was walking slowly, with his head down, and twirling around</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">his finger a topaz necklace. As soon as he perceived Messrs. Clifton and</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Fairfax, his forehead flushed, and he hastily crammed the necklace into</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">his vest pocket. Frank thought the whole thing strange, but, but</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">stranger still was the conduct—the metamorphosis—the transfiguration of</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Mr. Clifton, who, upon observing the Major, instantly put a violent</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">constraint upon himself, and became the broadfaced, rosy, smiling,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">blue-eyed, debonnair old gentleman, so lavish in the display of his fine</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">teeth, and hearty, cordial words and smiles. Frank was provoked that</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">their conversation was so completely arrested.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Ah, good-morning,” said Mr. Clifton, addressing the Major. “Been to</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Hardbargain this morning so early? How are all the folks up there? See,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Archer? Why didn’t he walk with you? Eh? Expected him!”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“I have not been to Hardbargain, sir,” replied the Major, rather</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">morosely.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Been out taking a morning stroll then, eh? Fine appetite for breakfast,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">no doubt. And it is waiting for us, too. Come, Frank, let’s turn about.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">They did so. Frank now noticed for the first time that the manner of the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">old gentleman was conciliating, while that of the Major was surly.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">They soon reached the house, and the breakfast-room, where the ladies</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">were awaiting their arrival.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">As they entered, the countenance of Carolyn Clifton was flushed and</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">eager. But when they had all got in, and were seated at the table, the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">color died out of her face, leaving her pale as marble. She merely</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">trifled with her breakfast, pretending to eat, but no morsel passed her</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">lips. When breakfast was over, and the company dispersed about the room,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Carolyn almost reeled past her father in going out, and muttered with</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">pale lips—“Father! Not come yet?”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Never mind! Never mind, my dear! I will ride up to Hardbargain and</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">fetch him.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Not for the universe, father! if he never comes!” replied the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">determined girl, plucking up her spirit, and sweeping proudly past and</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">going into the piazza, where she sat, by-the-bye, with her eyes strained</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">up the mountain-path by which he ought to come.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Frank got no opportunity of speaking alone with Zuleime. Old Mr. Clifton</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">met him, however, when he came in from looking after his horse, and</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">said, kindly patting him on the shoulder—</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Indeed, my dear boy, I don’t see the least necessity for your leaving</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">us until after dinner. The stage coach doesn’t pass through L—— till</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">eight o’clock at night, and five or six hours is ample time in which to</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">reach there!”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Yes, sir! I grant it, but I have to go this morning to Hardbargain to</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">take leave of Mrs. Clifton, and of my friend Archer, if, indeed, the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">latter is not ordered on the same duty as myself, which, upon Miss</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Clifton’s account, I am inclined to fear!”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Oh! Are you going to ride to Hardbargain? Then, perhaps, you will be</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">pleased to learn that Zuleime is going there this morning, also, to</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">assist Mrs. Clifton in putting the last finishing touches to her dress</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">for this evening. And you can escort her!” said Georgia, smoothly</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">gliding between them, and laying her head and hand with child-like</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">freedom and affection upon the old man’s shoulder.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Oh! I shall be very happy!” said Frank, “_really_ happy—nay,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">_overjoyed, intoxicated_, with the prospect of an uninterrupted,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">farewell _tête à tête_ with Zuleime.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Old Mr. Clifton looked rather disappointed, but he was not of a very</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">combative disposition—especially had he no inclination to contradict</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Georgia. Besides, he at once reflected that there was really no danger.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">They couldn’t be married in the neighborhood, because they could get no</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">license, and no clergyman dare marry them without one. And it was not</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">probable, or even possible, that Frank would elope with his daughter on</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">the very eve of joining his regiment for a distant and dangerous</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">service. In truth, he felt it was folly to cherish a misgiving. And yet</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">he _had_ misgivings, nor could he banish them—the utmost extent of his</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">self-control was—not to _act_ upon them—not to forbid their riding</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">together. While Zuleime was putting on her hat and riding habit, Frank</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">got the ear of the old gentleman once more, and for the last time. The</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">old man had sunk into his broadbottomed flag chair in the hall, with his</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">thick gold-headed stick between his knees, and his two hands and his</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">chin resting upon it, when Frank stood before him with folded arms and</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">head dropped upon his breast, and said—</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Mr. Clifton—once more, and for the last time, I ask you, and I implore</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">you to answer me candidly. Is there any possibility that, under any</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">change of circumstances, at any future time, I may hope for your consent</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">to my union with Zuleime?”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">The earnestness, deepening almost into solemnity, of the young man’s</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">manner and words, impressed Mr. Clifton very deeply, but he replied—“Mr.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Fairfax, it is best to speak the plain, harsh, cutting truth, though</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">that truth is the axe laid to the root of all your hopes of Zuleime. No.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Yet I regret this, Frank! You do not know how much! But you must forget</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">her! I hope you will _soon_ do so! I know you _must_!”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Frank shook his head in despairing negation. And farther colloquy was</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">arrested by the coming down of Zuleime equipped for her ride.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Come here, my daughter! Now you must be _sure_ to be back by dinner</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">time, do you hear?”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Certainly, sir!”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“_Promise_ me.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Of course I do.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Upon your _honor_!” said the old man, seriously.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Upon my honor, sir, I will return by dinner time! But what makes you so</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">emphatic about it, dear father?”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“A notion of mine, my child! but I have your promise!”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Of course you have, sir!” said Zuleime, drawing on her gloves.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Mr. Fairfax was taking leave of Mrs. Clifton. Presently he turned to bid</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">adieu to Mr. Clifton.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">The old gentleman shook his hand warmly, wishing him all the success he</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">desired, and affecting to laugh and jest, while he exacted a like</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">promise from Fairfax, namely, that he should take his girl to</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Hardbargain, and leave her there to return by dinner time.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Frank gave his word very cheerfully. The young couple then mounted and</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">rode away. The old man watched them from the piazza in sorrowful love,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">murmuring—</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“God bless them. I wish they _could_ be married. Poor things. If they</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">_do_ love each other so much, or if they _think_ they do, which is quite</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">as bad while it lasts—why, it is but kind to let them have this last</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">little parting comfort of a ride together! And it was well, too—”</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">chuckled the old gentleman—“to tie them up with promises, so that they</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">can’t run away, which they might else be tempted to do in their parting</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">hour. But they will neither of them ever break their word, and I shall</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">have her back safe by dinner time. For it is utterly impossible for them</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">to get married without a license, and it is quite impracticable to get a</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">license this side of L——, or to ride to L—— between this and noon, much</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">less to ride thither and return here in time for dinner! Ah! I have them</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">there! And yet, I am sorry for them, too. Poor things!”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">All this time Carolyn Clifton had sat like one dead, only with her eyes</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">strained up the mountain bridal-path.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">In the meantime, Frank and Zuleime pursued their ride. As soon as they</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">were out of sight and hearing of a band of field laborers, employed in</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">cutting grass, and had entered the shady mountain-path, Frank said—</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Well, Zuleime, my dearest girl, I spoke to your father—”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">—“And his answer—I almost dread to hear it—yet I know what it was, too.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Frank nodded his head, and they rode on in silence for some minutes,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">broken at last by Frank, who suddenly exclaimed—</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Zuleime! you bear this so well!”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Frank, you know this is no new thing to me; I have known it, and been</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">prepared for it all along!” replied the girl, with a look of</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">resignation.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Oh, Zuleime! is there no way to prevent it?”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“None that I know of, Frank!”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Zuleime! I was in every way his equal—why, when that is the case, and</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">when I was supported by your voice, too—_why_ was I rejected?”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">The maiden shook her head.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Zuleime, when is this hideous marriage expected to come off—do you</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">know?”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Whenever Major Cabell chooses to demand my hand, I believe!”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Really! Upon my word! He is a personage of tremendous importance!</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Whenever HE chooses to demand your hand!! Zuleime! that is passing</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">strange! This affair seems then to rest entirely with Major Cabell!!!”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Yes, it does entirely.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Bless his Majesty. Zuleime, _what hold has that man on your father_?”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Zuleime shook her black ringlets mournfully, but did not reply.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Do you know, my dear girl, that I am impressed with the idea that your</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">father does not at heart wish to give you to Major Cabell, but rather</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">yields to a strange power the man holds over him?”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“At times I have thought so, too. But then my dear father at other times</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">really seems so set upon the marriage, that the thought has been driven</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">out of my head again! I do not know what to think! But what I _do_ know</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">is, that I will never willingly do anything to give my dear father</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">pain!”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“My dearest girl, do you know that I believe, from my soul, that your</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">marriage with Major Cabell will give your father more pain than any</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">other circumstance could?”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">The young girl looked up in surprise.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Zuleime! he told me to-day, that though he had promised you to Major</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Cabell, he would rather die than see you _un_happy, or stand in the way</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">of your _perfect_ happiness!”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“My dear father! My dear, gentle father! My fond, old father!” exclaimed</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Zuleime, with the bright tears rolling on her damask cheeks, like dew on</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">the red rose. “My kind, generous father! He shall never know that I am</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">unhappy! And neither _shall_ I be unhappy when pleasing him!”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“My dear, excellent girl! listen to me! You shall not be unhappy any</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">way! Do you suppose, Zuleime, that I could ride by your side so</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">cheerfully, if I thought you were going to marry that man, on whom your</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">father no more wishes to bestow you, than he wishes to send you to</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">perdition? Listen, my darling girl! When your father told me what I have</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">repeated to you, he went on to say, that for certain _family_ reasons,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">it was incumbent on him to fulfill his promise, and to bestow your hand</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">upon Major Cabell, _unless some insurmountable obstacle should interpose</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">to arrest the union_! Zuleime! a flood of light broke on me then! and I</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">felt and knew that the old man would yield his darling daughter to the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">mysterious power exercised over him by Major Cabell, rather than bestow</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">her with esteem and affection! Zuleime! without vanity, I think that he</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">loves me better, and would prefer me for a son-in-law, if he were free</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">to choose. I think, indeed I do, that he would hail with secret joy “an</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">insurmountable obstacle,” which would prevent the marriage, and not</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">implicate him in any manner. I think that was what he meant when he said</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">what he did. Still, I am convinced that the words slipped from him</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">unintentionally. I am certain he did not mean to give me the hint, which</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">nevertheless, I take, for he is a man of strict honor, I know, and would</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">never tamper with the _spirit_ of a promise any more than he would break</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">the _words_!”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Oh! no, he never would, indeed!”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“And again, my dearest girl, when I asked him just before we came away,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">whether, at any future time, under any possible contingency, I might</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">hope to obtain his consent to our union, he assured me that I might not,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">and earnestly entreated me to forget you! That further convinced me that</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">he had no design in giving me the hint upon which I am about to act—do</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">you hear me, dearest Zuleime?”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Zuleime did not, or at least did not appear to.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Zuleime, my darling, my love,” said Frank, dismounting in the path, and</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">lifting her from her saddle. “I am about to raise ’an insurmountable</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">obstacle’ to your marriage with the Major!”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Zuleime turned deadly pale with surprise and terror, and glanced wildly</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">around, while she fell upon his arm and seemed about to faint.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Why, Zuleime! Come, come. What is the matter? Don’t be afraid! What,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">afraid of _me_, of _Frank_, your playmate? Why, look up in my face and</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">see! Come lift up your head! I want to talk to you! There! there! Why,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">what are you afraid of? I will take _no_ step without your consent,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">sweet Zuleime!”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">The infinite tenderness of his words, tones and manner, reassured the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">frightened girl, and she raised her face, now suffused with blushes. He</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">supported her with his arm around her waist, while he pointed down into</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">a narrow glen to the right, and said—</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“There! Look there, Zuleime. Do you see that little stone house—there in</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">the bottom of the glen—there by the spring—but so much like the rocks,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">near it, and so deep in the shade, as hardly to be distinguishable! Do</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">you see it?”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Yes,” breathed the maiden, very low.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Do you know who lives there?”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“No.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“A good old man! A saintly old man! A poor Baptist missionary preacher,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">who lives in that hut quite alone, and _preaches_ there every Sunday to</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">an humble congregation, composed of poor mountaineers and negroes. He</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">has devoted his life to labor among the mountain people, and has done</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">wonders in reforming them! Is it possible that _you_, living in the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">neighborhood, knew nothing of him?”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Oh, yes! I have heard a great deal about Mr. Saunders, only I did not</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">know where exactly his hut was. There are so many of them, you know!”</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">said the girl, somewhat recovered, and much interested.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“My dearest Zuleime! we will go down to that hut! ‘I see by the smoke,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">that so gracefully curls,’ that the old man is at home. We will tell him</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">the whole story, as far as we know it, and get him to raise that</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">required insurmountable obstacle!”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Oh! Frank!” exclaimed Zuleime, shocked, delighted, terrified,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">overjoyed.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“But, my dearest Zuleime! my dearest love! I have recorded an oath in</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Heaven, to save you from that marriage with Cabell! And I will never</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">leave you until you are my wife. If you refuse NOW, I will throw up my</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">commission in the army, and live there in that hut with the old parson,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">until you _do_ consent!”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“But, my father, Frank! My dear father!”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Dearest girl, he will be glad!” Here Frank went over the whole story</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">again, and added—“And Zuleime, have you no love, no pity left from your</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">father to bestow upon the poor soldier who loves you so, and who is</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">going out to the Indian frontier, where he may lose his scalp, or be</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">burned alive, or eaten raw within a month by the red-skins? Will you</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">refuse his last prayer?” etc., etc., etc. Over and over again,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">fervently, earnestly, imploringly, despairingly he repeated the argument</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">and the prayer, while he held the maiden “half willing, half afraid.”</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“She who hesitates is lost,” it is said.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Zuleime hesitated a long time, and, consequently, was lost to all</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">eternity. What could she oppose, indeed, to what seemed so right and</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">reasonable? With a deep sigh she yielded at last. There was no path that</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">way down into the glen, and the descent was deep and precipitous, and</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">overgrown with stunted cedar, pine and thorn bushes. So, Romeo and</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Juliet began to clamber down, by foot-holds of jagged rocks, and</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">fist-holds of thorn bushes, to the great risk of wounded hands and torn</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">pants and petticoats. And so it was in rather a disordered state of</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">attire, as well as in an excited state of mind, that they at last</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">arrived before the door of Father Lawrence’s cell, and rapped. While</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">they waited for the old man to appear, Frank, very much to the surprise</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">of Zuleime, drew from his vest pocket a license—a regular _bona fide_</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">license, signed by the clerk of R—— county, and sealed with the county</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">seal. Resting his foot upon the door-step, he took off his hat, turned</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">it down on his knee, laid the license upon its top, and drawing from his</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">other pocket a travelling pen and ink case, proceeded to write the names</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">of Francis Rutland Fairfax and Zuleime Dovilliers Clifton in the blank</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">spaces.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“You look surprised, my dearest girl,” said he, as he returned the pen</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">and ink case to his pocket. “You wonder how I came by this license? I</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">will tell you. I have it by a stroke of the rarest good fortune. You</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">know, being groomsman, I was entrusted with the duty of riding to L——,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">and procuring the marriage license for Archer and your sister. Well!</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">when I arrived at the clerk’s office, by the strangest caprice of</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">memory, I entirely forgot Miss Clifton’s middle name; so I got the clerk</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">to give me one license filled out with the names of Carolyn Clifton and</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Archer Clifton, and then knowing how extremely punctilious you all are</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">here, in this county, I procured another license regularly signed and</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">sealed, but leaving blank spaces for the proper names of the parties!</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">There, darling! that is the manner in which I came by it! Now, this</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">blank one I fill up with our names, which I really think look quite as</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">pretty as the others would! As for Clifton and your sister, if they want</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">a license, they will have to put up with the first, which I will hand to</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Archer as soon as we get to Hardbargain. Bless my soul! what has become</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">of that old man?” he exclaimed, rapping loudly, then trying the door and</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">pushing it open. The house was empty. Frank looked dismally</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">disappointed, but Zuleime plucked him by the sleeve, and whispered,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">hurriedly—</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Here he comes—behind you!”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">And he turned to see the old preacher coming from the spring, bending</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">under the light weight of a small pail of water. Frank immediately went</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">to him, greeted him respectfully, and took from his hand the pail, and</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">carrying it, walked by his side, till they reached the house. Lieutenant</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Fairfax then introduced himself by name and station, and presented Miss</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Zuleime Clifton. The old man bowed and offered his hand, with a courtly</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">grace, in strange contrast to his rude garb and rough habitation. He</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">invited them to come in and sit down. And when they had entered, and</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Zuleime was seated, Frank took the old man aside, communicated the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">object of their call, and produced his license. The old man glanced from</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">the earnest countenance of Frank to the blushing, downcast face of</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Zuleime, shook his bald head, and looked very grave.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Frank drew him off to the farthest corner of the little hut, made him</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">sit down on the foot of his bed, seated himself by his side, and in a</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">fervid, earnest, eloquent manner, told him their little story.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Many times the old man shook his thin, gray locks. They were not good</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">things—these secret marriages—they never prospered. Marriage should be</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">open as day—with the blessing of God—with the blessing of parents—with</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">the sympathy of friends—with the good wishes of acquaintances to hallow</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">and prosper the union.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Oh!” said Frank, but this was an extraordinary occasion, the father was</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">really at heart not opposed to this marriage, but circumstances</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">compelled him to withhold his open consent—he himself, (Frank,) was</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">about to depart on a long journey, and merely wished to secure his bride</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">against a forced marriage of convenience during his absence. In short,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Frank recommenced the argument, and told it all over from beginning to</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">end.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Still the old man shook his bald head and demurred.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Frank began the story over again, recited the whole of it, with many</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">additions and improvements.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">To no purpose—the old man was obdurate. Frank, then half angrily, arose</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">and said—</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Come Zuleime! We must go on to the frontier together, and find somebody</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">to marry us on the route, and let Mr. Saunders here be responsible for</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">all trouble that may ensue, since with the license before him, he</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">refuses to unite us.” At this, Zuleime burst into tears and wept</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">heartily.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">The old preacher dropped his head upon his breast in troubled thought</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">for some moments, and, whether the arguments of Frank had after all</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">produced some effect, or whether he feared to encounter the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">responsibility of sending this wild young couple on their way unmarried,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">or whether he was moved to pity by the tears of Zuleime, or whether, as</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">is more probable, _all_ these considerations actuated him, I know not;</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">but he slowly rose to his feet, uncovered his head, and lifted up his</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">eyes in silent prayer awhile, then bade the young pair stand up, for</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">that he would marry them.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Frank clasped the hand of Zuleime, and led her forward. And in less than</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">fifteen minutes more, by the magic of a few words, the youth and maiden</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">were man and wife. And while Mrs. Fairfax, with trembling white fingers,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">was tying her hat, Mr. Fairfax would have emptied the whole contents of</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">his purse in the minister’s hands,—but, though that money might have</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">supplied the poor old preacher with many necessaries for which he really</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">suffered, and made him very comfortable for a long time, yet he turned</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">away his head, and put it away from him, saying—</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“No, young man, I cannot take your gold; I may have erred in what I have</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">done, but I did not do it for money.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“But you always take a fee, do you not?”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“From others I do—not from you. It would not be blessed.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">The boyish brow of Frank clouded and darkened, but it cleared again</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">instantly as he turned towards his bride.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">They were about to bid the old minister adieu, when he took a hand of</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">each, and joining them again, held them in his own, while he said—</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Children, if this thoughtless act bring you into much trouble, in the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">long, weary years of trial and suffering that may result from it,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">reproach _me_ for my share in the rash deed as much as you please,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">but,—” he paused and looked solemnly from one to the other,—“never, as</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">you value love, and fidelity, and peace,—never, as you value the favor</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">of Heaven, never reproach each other with it! So may God forgive, and</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">bless, and prosper you! Good-bye!”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">The young bride and groom had bowed their heads during this benediction,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">and at its close responded with a silent, heartfelt amen. They then left</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">the cabin.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">If the minister of God grievously erred in performing this secret</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">marriage ceremony, he was soon called to account for it; the old man</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">died that night.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">As Mr. and Mrs. Fairfax left the cabin, they perceived Kate Kavanagh, on</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">her little rough-coated mountain pony, coming straight down into the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">glen—her sure-footed little animal treading with perfect security the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">precipitous descent down which they had been obliged to clamber. Kate</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">was looking very pale and care-worn, so that her ponderous abutting</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">forehead, in its pallor, reminded Frank of a barebleached cliff. And,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">indeed, he thought that Kate’s face looked more like that of an anxious</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">politician, with the affairs of a nation on his shoulders, than of a</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">grieved girl. But this was the fault of her marked features. But little</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">time or thought had Mr. Fairfax to bestow upon the mountain-girl; so as</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">soon as he caught sight of her, he turned in another direction, to avoid</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">being recognized, saying—</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“By all that’s fatal, my dearest love, we were near being detected! And</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">by all that’s fortunate, we have escaped! Come, this way, we will take a</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">stroll down the glen and into the forest for a little while, until this</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">girl is clear of the way.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Oh, but it will delay us so much, I shall not have time to go to</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Hardbargain, and assist Aunt Clifton, and get back home to dinner, as I</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">promised!”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“_My dear!_” said Frank, reproachfully, “do you grudge me these last few</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">hours of your society, when we are about to be separated so far and so</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">long? Besides, you know you are my own dear wife now. Will you refuse?”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“No, no, I cannot! But, oh, let me return to father—my dear, fond,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">confiding father,—as soon as I promised! Let me keep the word of promise</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">to his ear, if I have broken it to his hope!” cried Zuleime, bursting</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">into a passion of tears.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Safe tears, and unobserved but by him who kissed them away, for already</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">they had entered the thicket, and were veiled from the sight of Kate</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Kavanagh, who now dismounted before the door of the hut, and taking from</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">the horns of the saddle a basket and a bundle, entered the poor</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">preacher’s humble habitation. We will turn from the erring pair and</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">enter with her. None but God knew how much disinterested good the poor</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">mountain-girl did in this world. Even the minister, who loved and</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">respected her, knew little beyond the good she did for him. He knew that</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">she knit new stockings and darned old ones for him—that she took his</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">scanty clothing every week, and mended, and washed, and ironed it for</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">him—and that when she brought it back, she would always bring him</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">butter, cream and cheese of her own making, and a fresh loaf of rising</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">bread of her own baking, and often some little rural luxury besides, as</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">a jar of honey or a piece of venison. And that she would stay and clean</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">up his house before she left. He knew that she was his good spirit.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">As Kate entered the room, the old man came and met her, and took the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">basket and the bundle from her hands and set them down, and set a chair</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">for her, and made her sit down in it, while he said—</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“My dear child! my excellent child, you do too much for me! You hurt</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">yourself, Catherine, and make me too deeply your debtor!”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Kate waved her hand in that quick, short way peculiar to herself,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">silently beseeching him to stop.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“But it is the truth, Catherine, my child! I shall never be able to</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">repay you!”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Oh, sir! you have reversed the case! It is _I_ who am _your_ debtor! If</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">I were not _particularly_ your debtor for all the education—mental, and</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">moral, and religious, that I have ever received, up to the time of my</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">coming to Hardbargain—still I should be _generally_ your debtor, as</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">youth is the general debtor of age—owing it all the service it can</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">give.” Then, to change the subject, the girl laid off her straw hat,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">drew off her sheep-skin home-made mittens, and arose and uncovered her</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">basket, saying—“Instead of a loaf of rising bread, Mr. Saunders, I have</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">brought you some fresh biscuits; I thought they might be an agreeable</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">change. There is also a fresh print of butter, and a bottle of cream,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">and a beef’s tongue, boiled—I thought the last would give you an</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">appetite—I think you have not had a good appetite, lately!” And without</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">more ado Catherine put the things away in the cupboard, setting the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">bottle of cream in a bowl of water, to keep cool, and wishing to herself</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">that she had a lump of ice to put on the old man’s print of butter.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Next, she unrolled the bundle, took the old man’s nicely washed and</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">mended clothes, and put them neatly away in the chest of drawers. Then</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">she set the empty basket aside, rolled up her sleeves, stooped down upon</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">the hearth, and began to make the fire, saying—“You know I have come to</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">dine with you to-day, Mr. Saunders!”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“I know you have come to bring me many comforts, and to cook my dinner,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">and clean up my house, and make me very comfortable, you good girl, my</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">dear little Brownie!”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Catherine moved about, in her quick and quiet way—filled and put on the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">kettle—for the old man would always have his cup of tea—and set the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">table, placing all the little rarities she had brought upon it. When all</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">was ready, and they sat down, the old man found leisure to observe that</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Kate ate nothing, and looked pale and thoughtful.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“What is the matter, my dear Kate?—you who are _always_ serious, are</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">_now_ positively sorrowful! What is it?”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Kate, who was truth itself whenever she spoke, chose for that reason to</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">give no answer.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">The old man looked more and more disturbed, and laying down his knife</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">and fork, said—</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Nay, but Catherine, my dear child, there is something the matter! I do</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">not wish to intrude on your confidence, but if you have any trouble that</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">you think I may possibly be able to soothe—confide in me, as if I were</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">your own father, my child.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Dear Mr. Saunders, don’t trouble your good heart about my cloudy face.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Sure and hasn’t a poor girl the same right to her smoke that a wealthy</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">young lady has to her vapors?” said Kate, smiling.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">The old minister did not press his question, but resumed his knife and</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">fork with a look of mortification that worried Catherine, so that she</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">said—</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“I will tell you, then, what troubles me. My dearest, best friend and</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">patron, Captain Clifton, has bidden me good-bye, and departed for the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">frontier! That is bad—oh, yes!—very bad. But that is not the worst. He</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">has gone away very unhappy. I might as well tell you what everybody will</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">soon know:—his marriage is broken off! He has gone away in anger with</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">his promised bride. He has gone away so wretched! Mr. Saunders, when I</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">saw him last night, looking so pale, and stern, and proud—and knew the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">haughtiness and the anguish of his heart, I thought I could have died to</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">have restored peace and joy between him and her he loved so strongly.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Merciful Heaven!—those Cliftons! This is another instance of their</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">fatal subjection to passion! Do you know, my dear child, what caused</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">this quarrel?”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“I know nothing but this—the marriage is broken off for the present! I</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">do not know wherefore.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Some jealous suspicion of one party or the other! Those Cliftons all</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">have Spanish blood in them, and the Spanish character is uppermost in</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">their nature. They are all haughty, reserved, jealous, suspicious.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Ah, but they are full of courage, magnanimity and benevolence,” said</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Catherine.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Archer Clifton is of a very jealous and suspicious nature—was his</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">betrothed inclined to coquetry?”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Oh, I do not know, sir, but the misunderstanding did not originate in</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">any charge against Miss Clifton. It was something of which Miss Clifton</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">accused _him_, but of what, I do not know!—he did not say. My dear Mr.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Saunders, I told you what troubled me, to satisfy your kind heart, and</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">allay your benevolent anxiety on my account. And now please forgive me,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">for beseeching you not to question me farther upon the subject. They—the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">parties, I mean—are far removed above my sphere of thought and</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">action—and the investigation of their motives of action, by me, seems to</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">involve a certain indelicacy—I fear even impertinence of interference,”</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">said Catherine, gently.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Yet, far above your sphere of thought and action as you say they are,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">they are not—at least _one_ of them is not—above your sphere of sympathy</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">and emotion. _His_ sorrow affects _you_ with sorrow!”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">The blood rushed to Kate’s brow, and she remained silent.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">The old man and the maiden soon after arose from the table. She washed</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">up the dishes, tidied up the house, and collected the poor preacher’s</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">soiled and broken clothes, and tied them in a bundle to take away with</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">her to wash and mend. Then she tied on her hat, and took leave of him;</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">the old man calling her back, again and again, with vague, prophetic</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">meaning, to repeat over and over—“God bless you, my child! God bless</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">you!” It was his dying benediction.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">A poor mountaineer, that called early the next morning to get the poor</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">minister to the poor to come and bury his wife—found the old man dead.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>

<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">All the forenoon, Carolyn Clifton sat in the same place and in the same</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">attitude in which we left her, affecting to read, but really watching</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">the mountain-path with heart-sickening anxiety. Every distant sound of a</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">horse’s hoofs that struck upon her ear, sent an electric shock to her</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">heart, causing her to start violently, tremble, and turn deadly sick and</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">faint, with accelerated hope and fear, until its nearer approach</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">revealed some neighbor going on his way, or some negro coming from the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">mill or the village, to her despairing sight. Even the sound of carriage</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">wheels, as they occasionally rolled by, made her heart pause in its</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">pulsations until it passed, and proved to be some family going on a</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">visit or a shopping errand.—For still she hoped that if he did not come</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">down the mountain-path on horseback, he might come round the road with</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">his mother in her carriage. He came not. And oh, the wedding-day was</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">almost over! No one saw the strife of hope and fear, like the struggle</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">of life and death, going on silently in her bosom. Mrs. Georgia Clifton</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">spent the whole forenoon in her own apartment, professing to be engaged</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">with many elegant preparations for the evening; but really full of</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">triumph for the success of her wicked scheming, and anxiety and wonder</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">for the events of the evening, and dark regret also for the absence of</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">him who, if lost to Carolyn forever, was lost to herself for a time at</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">least. With all these passions and emotions striving in her bosom, she</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">dared not show herself, lest her conscious heart and conscious face</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">should betray her—for Georgia was yet young in wickedness.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">The Misses Cabell were in their own chamber, putting a few finishing</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">touches to their dresses for the evening, for they, with Zuleime, were</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">to be the bridesmaids.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Zuleime herself had not yet returned, although it was near noon.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Old Mr. Clifton had been out, as was his daily habit of a forenoon,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">riding around his plantation.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">He came in to-day a little earlier than usual, and finding his daughter</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">exactly where he left her, but looking still more pale, haggard and</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">anxious than in the morning, he sat down by her side, put his arm</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">tenderly around her waist, and gazed lovingly into her whitened and</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">sharpened countenance, before he said interrogatively—</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Not come yet, Carolyn?”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“No, sir!” answered the young lady rising and putting off her father’s</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">caressing arm, and her own humiliating despondency, with a proud and</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">queenly air.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Well!” said the old man, with sudden energy, “I WILL certainly now ride</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">up to Hardbargain and know the reason. DANDY!—my horse, there! Bring him</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">back!—I’ve not done with him!”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Father!” said Carolyn, seizing his hand, and detaining him, while she</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">raised her head and looked and spoke in a manner that reminded him more</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">strongly than ever of her arrogant mother, “Father, _no_, you will not</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">go! No, no, father, if you have any love for _me_, any respect for the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">memory of my dead mother, _do not_ subject her daughter and yours to</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">such a mortification! No, father, if he _never_ comes, never go after</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">him!”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“You’re a fool, girl!” cried the old man, breaking away from her, “a</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">palpable fool!—You were a fool for quarreling with him and sending him</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">away, and now you are a greater fool for persisting in the quarrel.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">‘Mortification,’ indeed! Who’ll be the most mortified this evening, I</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">wonder, ‘if he never comes?’ What the deuce are we to say to the people</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">who will come here this evening to see you married? Tell me that?”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Before she could say another word, a large family carriage rolled down</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">the road, and turned and entered the lawn.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Carolyn sank back in her seat, nearly swooning with the swift hope and</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">fear that strove almost to agony as she gazed.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">It looked so like Mrs. Clifton’s carriage.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">It was not, however. It contained the very earliest of the wedding</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">guests, who, coming from a distance of thirty miles, had set out early</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">enough to arrive in time to secure a whole afternoon’s rest and</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">refreshment before dressing for the evening. This was customary with</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">those coming from afar.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Old Mr. Clifton went down the steps, to receive his guests.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Carolyn arose and withdrew into the house, fortunately before she had</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">been recognized by the visitors; for it would have been shockingly out</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">of all etiquette for a bride to be visible on her wedding-day before the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">wedding-hour.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">When Mr. Clifton had ushered his guests into the drawing-room, he</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">returned to the piazza to give some directions concerning the stabling</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">of the horses, for where so many animals were expected to be provided</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">for, it required some extra thought and care in their bestowal. While</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">still giving his orders, he saw his younger daughter riding slowly up to</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">the house. Pleased to see her return in safety, in spite of his evil</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">forebodings of the morning, and thinking besides that she could give him</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">some news of the laggard bridegroom, he hastened to meet her and lift</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">her from the saddle, with a joyous—</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Well, my darling! well, my damask rose-bud! Back in time, according to</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">promise, eh?”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">But at the sight of her father, the girl’s face flushed and paled so</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">swiftly, her bosom rose and fell so rapidly, her whole frame was so</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">agitated, her manner so confused, that the old man was seized with alarm</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">and exclaimed, hurriedly—</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“In the name of Heaven, my dearest child, what is the matter?”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">But Zuleime, incapable of reply, looked as if she would sink into the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">ground.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Mr. Clifton’s first definite thought was that some accident or</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">catastrophe had befallen the bridegroom.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Good Heaven, Zuleime, what has happened? Where is Archer Clifton?</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Speak—has he come to any harm?”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Much relieved that her father’s suspicions had fallen out of the true</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">track—yet still considerably shaken, Zuleime replied, in a faltering</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">voice, that Captain Clifton had received orders, and had departed that</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">morning with Lieutenant Fairfax for Winchester, where their regiment was</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">quartered, and that Mrs. Clifton, of Hardbargain, desired to see Mr.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Clifton as soon as possible. Without another word—totally unsuspicious</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">that Mrs. Fairfax stood before him—the old man threw himself on</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">horseback, and rode furiously toward Hardbargain.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Mrs. Frank Fairfax, our runaway daughter, and widowed bride, stole to</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">her own little room to weep in secret, a little over her fault, but a</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">great deal over the absence of and the danger about to befall her</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">husband.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Dinner was served without Mr. Clifton, Miss Clifton, Zuleime, and the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Misses Cabell. Mrs. Georgia Clifton alone entertained the newly arrived</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">company. This did not occasion remark. Mr. Clifton was known to be</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">absent, and it was customary, as I said before, for the bride and her</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">attendants to be invisible.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">In the meantime, Carolyn Clifton sat in her chamber—pride, love, regret,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">anger, hope, fear—all good and evil passions striving in her soul, or in</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">turn holding the mastery over it. It was drawing near the hour when she</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">should commence her bridal toilet, if indeed any bridal array was to be</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">assumed that evening. Amidst all her keen anxiety, she dreaded lest some</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">one should come in and tell her it was time to dress. What should her</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">proud heart permit her to explain to such a one. She need not have</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">feared interruption, however.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">The Misses Cabell, her bridesmaids, it is true, sat together in their</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">chamber very impatiently awaiting a message from the bride—very</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">impatiently, indeed, for after her ceremonious dressing, they had their</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">own very elaborate toilet to make. But they would not enter her</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">dressing-room unsummoned, or at least until they should receive from</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">some member of the family a suggestion that it was now proper to do so.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">And no one thought or remembered to give them the hint.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Mrs. Georgia Clifton—self-convicted of being the originator of all the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">great trouble that had befallen, and the greater that was about to</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">befall the house—kept herself as much as possible aloof.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">And Zuleime was as yet too deeply absorbed in the contemplation of her</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">own recent bridehood, and the sorrow of her widowhood, to think of</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">anything else.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Meanwhile old Mr. Clifton had ridden as for life up to Hardbargain,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">thrown himself from his horse, flung the bridle upon his neck and let</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">him go loose, while he himself rushed up the stairs and into the hall,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">and without the ceremony of a rap, burst into the quiet presence of Mrs.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Clifton as she sat sewing in her shady parlor. She arose calmly to</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">receive him; and the very quietness of the lady threw the excited old</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">gentleman off his guard, and out of his politeness, and into a rage.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Well, madam!” he exclaimed, throwing his hat down with a thump into a</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">chair, and tramping up and down the floor. “_Here’s_ a pretty state of</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">affairs!”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Mr. Clifton, you are excited.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Yes, madam, I AM excited!” interrupted the old man—“very _much_</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">excited, madam! Very much excited, _indeed_, madam! Where is Archer</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Clifton? tell me that!”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Mr. Clifton, sit down and compose yourself!”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Compose myself! Compose myself with a prospect of three hundred people</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">pouring into my house to-night, each one of them agape to see a wedding,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">and to have to tell them there will be no wedding!”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Mr. Clifton, you can’t regret this circumstance more than I do!”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“I _don’t_ regret it at all, ma’am! I rejoice at it, ma’am! I</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">congratulate myself and my daughter, ma’am! But I’ll have satisfaction,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">ma’am! I’ll have satisfaction, ma’am!” said the old man, wiping the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">perspiration from his red face.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Satisfaction for what you _rejoice_ at, Mr. Clifton?” inquired the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">lady, smiling at his unreasonable anger with herself.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“I’ll—_yes_—I’ll have satisfaction, ma’am!”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“From whom? From me? Do you intend to call me out as my son’s</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">representative? Do you wish to compel me to fight a duel; or to make an</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">apology—which?” inquired the lady, coolly.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Dem it, mem, I’ll—I’ll have satisfaction,” exclaimed the old man,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">growing shorter and shorter in his syllables. “I’ll—I’ll write to the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Colonel of the regiment! I’ll—I’ll make the matter known to the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Major-General of the Army! I’ll—yes, dem-me! I’ll go to Washington and</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">tell the President! I’ll have that young rascal cashiered, and broken</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">and dismissed from the service!”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“What! _all three_! Why, that is passing cruel! Quite as bad as being</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">killed and murdered, and mortally wounded!” said the lady, smiling at</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">his insane vehemence.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Dem it, mem! don’t take my words up!” he exclaimed, stamping up and</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">down the floor, and then breaking out into vituperative abuse of Archer</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Clifton, all addressed to Mrs. Clifton, who, though becoming very much</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">agitated, now preserved a dignified silence.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Mr. Clifton forgets that he is a man, and that he speaks to a woman!”</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">said a stern, but low-toned voice.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">And the old gentleman turned to see Kate Kavanagh, ‘severe in youthful</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">beauty,’ standing within the door; yes, in _beauty_, for her slight</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">figure was drawn gracefully up—her bosom heaving, her fine head erected,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">her cheeks crimson, and her eyes intensely brilliant with the just</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">indignation that moved her soul, as she walked straight up to Mrs.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Clifton, and said—</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Dearest lady, allow me—_do_ allow me to attend you to your own room,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">and be your substitute here, in waiting upon Mr. Clifton.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“No, Kate—no, my dear girl. I have to talk rationally to the man as soon</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">as he comes to his senses,” replied the lady.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“_Who is_ that girl?” inquired the old gentleman, not recognizing Kate</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">under the new aspect—or affecting not to do so. “Who _is_ that girl,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Mrs. Clifton?” he repeated, while the lady gazed fondly on her protégé.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Miss Kavanagh; my son’s ward, and my own adopted daughter,” replied</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Mrs. Clifton, without withdrawing her fond gaze from the face of Kate,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">who was blushing under it.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Miss Kavanagh, your son’s ward, and your own adopted daughter! A</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">promising relationship all around, that is—up—on—my—word—it—is!” said</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Mr. Clifton, very deliberately. “However,” he added, “she has brought me</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">to reflection, for which I thank her. And Mrs. Clifton, I feel sorry and</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">mortified that I have been betrayed into some violence of speech and</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">manner; it is a family failing, you know. Pray pardon me.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Mr. Clifton, please to sit down near me. My voice is not strong. It may</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">be disquietude, but I find a difficulty in raising it, or in keeping up</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">a running conversation.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“My dear sister, I am afraid your lungs grow weak. I am indeed! I have</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">noticed it before. I have said the same to Georgia and to Carolyn!</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Indeed, my dear sister Clifton, I wish you would take care of yourself.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">I was a brute to throw myself into a passion in your presence. I was,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">indeed! I see it has overcome you! Kate Kavanagh, my dear, you were</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">perfectly right. I _did_ forget myself. And you were a fine girl to</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">recall me. Give me your hand, my dear.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Blushing deeply, as was her wont when praised, Kate gave her hand,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">saying—half apologetically, half appealingly—</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Mrs. Clifton is not strong, sir. She should not be agitated, especially</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">so soon after her son has left her.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“I know she is not strong! My dear sister, I wish you’d be careful of</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">yourself! I do, indeed! You’re not strong.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“After fifty, we do not grow strong as we grow old,” said the lady,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">pointing to a chair by her side, and indicating that he should take it!</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">He did so. And then Mrs. Clifton turned to Kate, and said—</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Now Catherine, my dear, I wish you to go up into my chamber and amuse</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">yourself with a book, while I have a confidential talk with Mr.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Clifton.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Kate immediately arose, curtsied, and left the room.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Mrs. Clifton turned to her brother-in-law, and said, inquiringly, “You</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">know the cause of this lovers’ quarrel?”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Of course I do, madam! Satan fly away with them both! I know all about</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">it! It was about _her_—up stairs!” he replied, indicating Kate Kavanagh</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">by a crook of his thumb.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Yes; it was about Kate. But it was very absurd!”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Now, I don’t know that ma’am!”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“But it certainly _was_—ridiculous! Mr. Clifton! _she_, Catherine, knows</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">nothing about it! Does not even dream that _she herself_ had the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">remotest connection with the quarrel, and I do hope and trust, that she</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">never may suspect it. What I wish to say to you, is plainly this: That I</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">know enough of human nature generally, and of young people particularly,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">and of Archer and Carolyn individually, to feel sure that this very</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">absurd and extremely inconvenient quarrel and separation—”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Yes, _very_ extremely inconvenient, indeed!” emphatically interrupted</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">the old man.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Is only temporary—”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Yes, ma’am, but that don’t make it the less embarrassing—the less</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">inconvenient!”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“I know it! Hear me out!”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“What the deuce, ma’am, are we to do with the people who are coming to</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">the wedding even now?”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“I am about to tell you, if you will quietly listen to me.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Well! well! Yes, ma’am! I beg your pardon—I am all attention.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Carolyn, I am sure, already regrets her hasty violence of temper.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Yes! that she does! It’s easy to see that!”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“And Archer, who is slower to anger and slower to repentance—though</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">deeper and stronger in both for being slow—Archer, in a very few days,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">will bitterly repent the step he has taken, more especially as being on</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">his Western march, it will be impossible to retrace it. Under these</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">circumstances, this is what you must say to the assembled company</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">to-night:—You must tell them, that last night a peremptory order arrived</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">for Captain Clifton to join his regiment immediately; and that the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">marriage is deferred for the present. Let the company then enjoy</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">themselves as at a ball. And all will go off well, and without scandal.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">I will be present myself, as the representative of our side of the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">house. I sent for you, Mr. Clifton, to give you this advice, and to</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">suggest this plan of action in meeting the embarrassing difficulties of</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">this evening. I should not propose this, if I were not sure that the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">marriage _is_ only deferred—that if the parties live, it will assuredly</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">take place. I am _certain_ it will, Mr. Clifton! I am willing to pledge</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">my own truth and honor on it, and become responsible for it! The plan I</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">propose to you for meeting the guests this evening, is truest, wisest</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">and best—think of it!”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“I do not think of it at all! I see its excellence at a glance. I spring</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">to meet it! I embrace it! I hug it to my heart! Oh, Mrs. Clifton, you</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">are our deliverer! Oh, Mrs. Clifton! you are the great-grand-daughter of</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Oliver Cromwell, the general, the conqueror, the deliverer, the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">statesman, the politician, the diplomatist, the everything at an</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">emergency!—You’ll see how gloriously I’ll execute your orders! You’ll</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">make me Lieutenant-General when you are Lady Protector of the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Commonwealth!” exclaimed the old man, starting up and clapping his hat</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">upon his head, and joking like a boy, for very joy that his difficulty</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">was smoothed. He shook hands with Mrs. Clifton, begging her not to be</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">late, as he should want the encouragement of her presence in order to</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">enable him to make his speech. Then he mounted his horse, and rode</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">rapidly away down the mountain-path to Clifton. When he arrived at home,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">he found the lawn already covered with carriages, horses and servants,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">and the piazza, halls, and all the first floor rooms, thronged with</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">company. He passed through them all, bowing right and left and hastened</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">to his daughter’s room. Mr. Clifton had some doubts about getting his</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">proud daughter to consent to the wise plan suggested by his</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">sister-in-law. But he meant to carry his consent by a coup-de-main. So</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">he pushed open her door, burst into her chamber, and threw himself,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">puffing, blowing, and perspiring, into the nearest chair, exclaiming—</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“He’s gone, Carolyn! He’s clear gone, confound him!”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Carolyn drew nearer her father, and gazed into his face, to read there</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">the confirmation of what she scarcely could believe. The old man wiped</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">his streaming face with his handkerchief, and stuffed it again into his</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">pocket, exclaiming—</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Yes! he’s gone! gone! gone! gone!” Then opening wide his arms, he</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">murmured, “But never mind, my dear child! you’ve got your old father</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">left to love you, and to avenge you, too, if needful! Don’t grieve! Come</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">to my bosom! Don’t grieve!”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“‘_Grieve_,’ sir!” exclaimed the imperious girl, elevating her queenly</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">head, “we do not _grieve_ for a traitor! We pronounce sentence on him,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">and execute it!”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“True! true! my noble girl! There spoke your mother’s daughter! Yet—”</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">suddenly cried the old gentleman, as by a quick recollection and</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">revulsion of feeling, “what a devil of a kettle of fish this is, my</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">dear! Blame the fellow, what are we to do? Deuce take the man—what are</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">we to say to the people down stairs? _Say_, Carolyn! Woman’s wit is</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">quick! Can you think of anything?”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Carolyn stood in proud and bitter thought for some minutes, and then she</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">smiled, with a scornful smile, and said—</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Do nothing, sir! Let all go on as was planned! Let the band of music</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">take its place in the saloon! Let the wedding guests come, and be</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">received! And _then_ leave all the rest to me! And now, my dear father,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">pray excuse me, as it is time to dress.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“To dress! Why, Carolyn, what do you mean? Are you mad? Dress for what?”</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">asked the old gentleman, anxious to know if perchance _her_ idea in any</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">way resembled the plan adopted by himself, from Mrs. Clifton’s</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">suggestion.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“No, sir! I am not mad. ‘My pulse, as yours, doth temperately keep</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">time,’” said the young lady, extending her hand to the bell-rope, and</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">ringing a peal that presently brought her woman hurrying up stairs and</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">into her presence.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Darky!” said she addressing her attendant, “go to Miss Zuleime, and to</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">the Misses Cabell, and let them know that I have waited for them some</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">time.” The old handmaid went out, and Carolyn turned to her father, and</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">said, “My dearest father! when I am dressed I will send for you, and we</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">will have a conversation, in which I will tell you my simple plan for</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">getting through the evening. I have not quite matured it yet! Ah! here</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">are the girls! Good evening for a couple of hours, father!”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">She opened the door for her father, who just escaped the young</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">bridesmaids, who were coming in.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">He went out muttering—</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“I don’t know what she means. I suppose I can have confidence in her. At</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">least I must for the _present_, and then, there is Mrs. Clifton’s plan.”</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">He went into his own room and arrayed himself in festive garments for</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">the occasion, and then went below stairs to groan inwardly over the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">numerous arrivals of guests, whose carriages thronged the lawn, and</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">whose servants crowded the piazza, hall and entries. Presently a servant</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">approached him, and said, respectfully, in a low voice—</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Miss Clifton’s compliments, sir, and will see you in her own room.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">The old gentleman hastened thither. He found his daughter ready dressed,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">and quite alone. Her bridesmaids had gone to make their own toilets.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Father!” she said, “I will not wear the willow for a recreant lover! I</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">have determined that the festivities shall go on to-night. I will go</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">down and lead off the first dance myself. You, my father, may explain,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">as you please, that the marriage is broken off, but that the music,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">dancing, and feasting are not arrested for that reason.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">The old man had determined within himself what to speak but he answered—</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“My dear child, are you _equal_ to it?”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“_Equal sir?_ Try me!”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Very well, my dear. Come! And I will say—what is proper upon the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">occasion.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">In the meanwhile the splendid company assembled in the brilliantly</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">lighted saloon, awaited with great impatience the entree of the bridal</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">train.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Made conspicuous in that gorgeous assembly by his black gown and bands,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">sat the clergyman who was to perform the ceremony.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Georgia—darkly, resplendently beautiful as ever, moved gracefully</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">through the crowd—full of gracious courtesy, yet flushed, anxious,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">feverish—half fearing that the bridegroom would appear at this last</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">moment. This fear was aroused by the presence, and the calm, cheerful,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">self-possessed looks of Mrs. Clifton, of Hardbargain. At length light</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">steps were heard in the hall. The doors of the saloon where thrown open.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">And all eyes were turned to see the wedding procession enter. But</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">instead of a bridal train, came old Mr. Clifton, leading in his daughter</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Carolyn. The surprise, the wonder of the company was at first silent and</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">breathless as it was profound. But soon a low whisper arose, and like a</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">low breeze in the leaves, passed from one to another, until the room was</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">in a general buzz.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Mr. Clifton led his daughter into the centre of the saloon, and with her</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">still hanging on his arm, turned and faced the company, waiting until</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">they should be silent before he would speak. The father and daughter, as</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">they stood there, presented a fine, imposing appearance. Both were</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">arrayed with the gorgeous splendor that prevailed at that day.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">The old gentleman had his snow-white hair turned back off his forehead,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">and carried all down to the nape of his neck, where it was plaited into</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">a queue, and adorned with a large white satin bow, both snowy plait and</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">bow in pleasant relief against the back of the dark crimson velvet</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">coat—his vest and small clothes were of white satin, and his long hose</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">of white silk were fastened to the small clothes below the knee with</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">white satin bows and gold buckles—his slippers were of crimson morocco,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">with high heels, large bows, and gold buckles. His dress was rather</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">antiquated even for that day. And he stood there waiting for silence</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">with the suave and stately courtesy of the old school gentleman.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Very much like a queen looked the beautiful Carolyn, but very little</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">like a bride, either in her dignified self-possession, or in her</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">magnificent array. Her fair hair was carried up above her forehead, and</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">dressed high, in the regal style of that day. Its rich waves and bands</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">were wreathed with pearls, and adorned with a plume of white ostrich</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">feathers, powdered with minute silver spangles. Her neck and arms were</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">bare, but adorned with pearls, and softly shaded with the finest lace at</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">the edge of the boddice and sleeves. Her dress was of rich blue satin</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">brocade, made with long waist, sharp pointed stomacher, and flowing</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">sleeves and flowing skirt—the edges of the skirt finished with a very</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">deep border of silver embroidery; a lighter border of the same running</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">around the sleeves; the stomacher was embroidered with silver and</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">pearls. Over her skirt she wore a train of splendid lace, lightly</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">embroidered with a running vine of silver. She toyed with an elegant fan</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">of carved mother-of-pearl and marabout feathers. She stood there, as I</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">said, not at all like a bride, either in her gorgeous apparel, or her</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">self-asserting manner. She stood there with a gay, proud air, beneath</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">which none could have discerned the deeply humiliated spirit of the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">arrogant woman, or suspected the wounded and breaking heart of the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">forsaken bride.—When the murmur of voices which had greeted their</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">entrance had subsided, and silence was restored, Mr. Clifton bowed</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">deeply, and—in the somewhat high-flown grandiloquence of style he had</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">once seen exhibited by a manager of a city theatre, when apologising for</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">the non-appearance of the evening’s star—spoke as follows: “Ladies and</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">gentlemen, the distinction of your presence here this evening, has been</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">prayed that you might give the honor of your countenance to the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">espousals of my nephew and daughter. You have graciously accorded us the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">dignity of your society here for that purpose.” (An embarrassed pause,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">while the assembly listened in breathless curiosity and expectation, and</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">he continued,) “Ladies and gentlemen, ‘man _pro_poses, but God</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">_dis_poses.’ The great Arbiter of destiny has ordained the issue of</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">events otherwise than as we had hoped, planned, and expected. Even last</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">night suddenly came a peremptory order from head-quarters, to Captain</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Clifton, to join his regiment instantly for the purpose of taking the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">command of a detachment of cavalry, to march immediately to the Indian</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">frontier to put down an irruption of the Shoshowanawas! Ladies and</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">gentlemen!” (continued the old gentleman, warming up with his subject,)</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“you know the stern, uncompromising duty of the soldier at such a</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">crisis. One syllable—one single syllable comprehends his insupportable</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">obligation—‘Go.’ The man, the lover, the bridegroom must give place to</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">the soldier. As our greatest poet, Walter Scott, has it,—the soldier at</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">the sound of the trumpet must</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2"><span class="Apple-converted-space">                      </span>“‘Leave untended the herd,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2"><span class="Apple-converted-space">                        </span>The flock without shelter,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2"><span class="Apple-converted-space">                      </span>The dead uninterred,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2"><span class="Apple-converted-space">                        </span>The bride at the altar.’</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Ladies and gentlemen, our gallant Captain Clifton has literally left</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">his ‘bride at the altar.’ But soldier’s love may not mourn bridegroom’s</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">loss. Nor may we deny ourselves the distinction and joy of your presence</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">for the whole night—nor,” (the old man was unconsciously sliding from</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">his lofty magniloquence down to the plain vernacular,) “nor must I</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">disappoint these young men and maidens of their dance to-night. Ho!</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">music there! Strike up the liveliest quadrille air upon your list. Let</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">them dance to the briskest music while they are fresh. Charley Cabell,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">my boy, come here and lead out your cousin Carolyn!”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Major Cabell advanced, and with much grace and dignity led Miss Clifton</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">to the head of the quadrille, as the music pealed forth.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Young gentlemen, select your partners!” exclaimed the old man, adding</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">example to precept, by choosing the youngest and prettiest girl in the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">room, and leading her to the place right opposite his nephew and</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">daughter. Soon all the surprise and disappointment were forgotten in</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">enjoyment. The evening was spent in the gayest hilarity—Carolyn Clifton,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">the forsaken bride, apparently the gayest of the gay. So gay, indeed,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">was Miss Clifton, that she drew upon herself the severe animadversions</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">of several ladies present, who affirmed that her conduct was heartless</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">in the extreme; to laugh and sing and dance and jest with such thorough</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">abandonment to pleasure, just after the departure of her lover to brave</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">the ghastly horrors of Indian warfare. Much more did they approve of the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">pensive manners of Zuleime. Poor Zuleime was all unskilled in</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">self-control—her heart was “exceeding sorrowful,” and so she let it</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">appear. The company separated at a very late hour that night, or rather</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">a very early hour of the next morning. Those in the neighborhood</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">departing, those from a distance retiring to the chambers to take some</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">sleep before breakfast, after which they were to set out for their</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">homes.</span></p>

<p class="p3"><span class="s2"><span class="Apple-converted-space">                              </span>THE SISTERS.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2"><span class="Apple-converted-space">                  </span>Sister! since I met thee last,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2"><span class="Apple-converted-space">                  </span>O’er thy brow a change hath past;</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2"><span class="Apple-converted-space">                  </span>In the softness of thine eyes,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2"><span class="Apple-converted-space">                  </span>Deep and still a shadow lies;</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2"><span class="Apple-converted-space">                  </span>From thy voice there thrills a tone,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2"><span class="Apple-converted-space">                  </span>Never to thy childhood known;</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2"><span class="Apple-converted-space">                  </span>Through thy soul a storm hath moved,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2"><span class="Apple-converted-space">                  </span>——Gentle sister, thou hath loved.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Overtasked, weary and exhausted by her long efforts, Carolyn Clifton</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">sought her own chamber, and threw herself, all splendidly arrayed as she</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">was, upon her bed. She had no fear of interruption, for it was not yet</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">daybreak, and her woman would not be up for several hours. So she was</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">surprised, and not at all pleased when a gentle rap came to the door.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">She would not answer or move to let the rapper know that she was awake.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">She was weary, weary with acting for one night, and needed rest. But</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">after the unknown had rapped two or three times, the door was gently</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">opened, and the sweet voice of Zuleime was heard to say—</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Sister, I know you are not asleep—will you let me come in?” And without</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">waiting for an answer, she entered, and softly closed the door, and came</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">to the bedside, saying—“I heard you when you came up and threw yourself</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">down on the bed, and I knew you were not asleep—let me stay with you,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">dear sister, won’t you?”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“No, no, Zuleime, I wish to sleep,” said Carolyn, still pressing both</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">hands to her throbbing temples.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Well, then, dear Carolyn, let me undress you, you can never compose</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">yourself in that dress;” and the affectionate girl began to take off her</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">slippers and stockings, saying—“I can take off all the small articles,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">and unlace your stomacher without disturbing you, sister, and then you</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">need not stand up more than a minute to disrobe.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">In indifference or abstraction, Miss Clifton permitted the gentle girl</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">to unclasp all her jewels, and loosen her dress, without ever removing</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">her hands, clasped tightly upon her temples, till Zuleime, wishing to</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">take down the elaborate _coiffure_, gently withdrew them, and unwound</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">the strings of pearls, and unfastened the plume of feathers. When the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">affectionate girl had laid aside all these glittering gewgaws, and freed</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">her long, fair hair, and relieved her oppressed and fevered head, the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">proud and scornful Carolyn, subdued by the gentleness of her sweet, only</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">sister, looked in her face, read there a strange sympathy, delicate as</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">it was deep, and suddenly put her arms around her neck, drew her head</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">down to her own, and kissed her fondly, murmuring—</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Oh, Zuleime! my child, my child! if you knew—”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“I _do_ know, dearest Carolyn! Dearest sister, I _do_ know it all! all!</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">and feel it—feel it from the bottom of my heart! That is the reason I</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">came in, Carolyn! But I did not come in to disturb you, even by my</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">sympathy. I came in to put you to sleep. Stand up, dearest Carolyn, and</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">drop these heavy robes, and I will throw this light wrapper around you,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">and then you can lie down again—there!”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Oh! sleep!—when shall I sleep again?” bitterly asked Carolyn, as</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Zuleime laid her head tenderly back upon the freshened pillow.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Well, don’t talk, dear Carolyn, and you will see that God will send</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">sleep.” And Zuleime cooled her brow by passing over it several times a</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">lump of ice in a napkin, and laid down by her side, and fanned her, in</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">that measured, monotonous time, so inducive to slumber. So slowly she</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">fanned her, resisting all her attempts to enter into conversation, until</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">wearied nature yielded, and Carolyn was asleep. Then, as it was morning,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Zuleime hoisted the windows, to admit a fresh current of air, but left</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">the blinds closed, to exclude the light. Next, she put all Carolyn’s</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">things carefully away, and silently restored the room to order. Then she</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">laid a folded napkin, dipped in ice water, over the still burning brow,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">and cautiously left the room, to go and order tea and toast to be ready</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">for Carolyn as soon as she should awake. She found the house below</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">stairs in a great but comparatively silent bustle. The servants, who had</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">scarcely retired the night previous, were engaged in clearing away the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">disorder of the saloon, parlor and dining-room, and in laying the cloth</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">for breakfast for the numerous visitors who had remained over night.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Zuleime passed on to the kitchen, and gave her orders, and then silently</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">stole up stairs again to her sister’s room.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Carolyn slept long and heavily. Several hours passed before she awoke.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">When she opened her eyes, and fixed them gratefully upon Zuleime, she</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">raised her arms, again embraced her, saying—</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“You have comforted me, dear Zuleime.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“And I will comfort you more, dear sister. I know how to do it. How do</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">you feel, Carolyn?”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Better—my head clearer—my nerves steadier—but a weary weight at my</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">heart.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“It shall go away, Carolyn. I know how to drive it away. But first you</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">must take something.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">And Zuleime rang the bell, and told the servant who appeared, to bring</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Miss Carolyn some _fresh_ tea and toast.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">While he was gone after it, Zuleime bathed her sister’s face and hands,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">and combed out her hair, and by the time she was made comfortable, the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">servant re-appeared with the refreshments.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">After Carolyn had breakfasted lightly, (and this was the first food she</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">had taken for thirty-six hours,) she fell exhausted back upon her</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">pillow, and said—</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“I cannot appear this morning, Zuleime! I am tired of acting a part!”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“You need not do it, dear Carolyn! The people have breakfasted, and are</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">almost all gone—and the others are going. Carolyn, dear, I saw _Archer_</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">when he went away—”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Miss Clifton was still too proud to make a comment.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Carolyn, he looked broken-hearted, despairing—indeed he did! Oh,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Carolyn! I think if he could have hoped that you would have made up with</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">him, he would have let his regiment go to perdition rather than not</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">hastened to your feet!”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Why did he not try, then?”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Oh, sister, you banished him, and men have some pride. He waited for</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">your relenting, I feel sure!”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Carolyn remembered, with bitter regret, her refusal to let her father go</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">and recall him.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Carolyn, write to him. The detachment under his command does not march</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">from Winchester for nine days yet. Write, Carolyn—there is abundant time</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">for him to get your letter and answer it before he goes. Then you will</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">be reconciled and happy. Everything will be restored, and you will</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">comfort yourself by remembering that he would have had to have gone, any</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">way, and that he is gone reconciled!”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Miss Clifton shook her head.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“No, Zuleime! I cannot! I should not know _how_ to write such a letter!</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">What could I say to him?”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Say! _I_ should know what to say! If you have banished him, revoke your</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">sentence of exile. If you have ascertained that you have done him</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">injustice, tell him so. If you are sorry that you parted in anger, let</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">him know it. If you wish to hear from him before he goes, ask him to</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">write to you.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“I could not!—I could not! I never could write such a letter! My</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">heart-strings would crack in the attempt.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“And are you _so_ proud? And will you let him go forth to that ghastly</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Indian war—oh, God! my flesh creeps only to think of it!” said Zuleime,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">shuddering. “And will you not retract your false accusation, and revoke</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">your cruel sentence of banishment, and express kind feelings and kind</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">wishes for him about to be exposed to such horrors?”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“I can’t! I can’t! I _cannot_! My heart-strings would snap with the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">effort! I can bear sorrow, but not humiliation! I can die, but I cannot</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">be humbled!”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“You cannot be humbled by an act of justice, sister. That letter would</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">be only an act of justice. And, oh! it would give him such happiness,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">and bring you such sweet peace, in place of all this heart-burning.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Think of it, dear Carolyn!”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">While Zuleime spoke, a rap was heard at the door, and a servant</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">appeared, and said that “Marster wished to see Miss Zuleime in the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">parlor.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Think of it, dear Carolyn,” said Zuleime, in a cheerful voice, kissing</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">her sister’s forehead, and then hastening out of the room.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Carolyn _did_ think of it! The idea once presented, she could not banish</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">it again;—the hope of a reconciliation once raised, could not be</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">suppressed! She could think of nothing else. “It was but an act of</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">common justice—it was a duty,” she repeated to herself, many times, to</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">answer the objections of her pride, which argued, “It is undignified,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">unwomanly, to make this overture.” Then her love, her benevolence, her</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">fears for him, pleaded, “It will make him so happy—it will fill his</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">heart with courage, and his arm with strength for the battle! And</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">suppose he should be killed?—what intolerable remorse will be added to</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">your sorrow for him when you reflect that he died without a relenting</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">word from you, who have been so cruelly unjust to him! That he died</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">under your own sentence of exile! Besides, if none of these things</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">happen, can _you_ bear these weary, weary days of estrangement, absence,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">and suspense?—weary, weary days, that will slowly, slowly drag</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">themselves through weeks, and months, and years of time?” Oh, no! No,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">no! She cannot bear that prospect! She will be just—she will do her</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">duty, and satisfy her affection at the same time. _Down, pride!_ for she</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">will write that letter. She did write it. She did not read it over</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">again, lest scorn should rise and compel her to hurl it down and set her</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">heel upon it. She set her teeth almost grimly in her determination to</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">protect that gentle, loving missive of sorrow and affection from an</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">assault of her besetting sin, as she sealed and directed it. She then</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">slipped on her dressing-gown, and stole down the back stairs, where she</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">found a boy lounging. She ordered him to saddle a horse immediately, and</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">take that letter to the post-office. Nay, she waited till she saw the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">boy off, and was sure that none had seen him or the letter he carried.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Then she returned to her own room, determining that no soul—not her</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">father—not even Zuleime, should share her confidence and know her</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">condescension.</span></p>

<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Zuleime went into the parlor and found her father alone. He was sitting</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">in an easy-chair, doing nothing, but apparently waiting for her.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Come hither, Zuleime,” he said.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">And when she went up to him, he drew her upon his knee, and passed his</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">left arm around her waist, while, with his right hand, he smoothed her</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">black hair.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">And he gazed fondly in her face. He noticed that her cheek was pale, and</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">her countenance pensive, but hoped that it was from the excitement of</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">the night before. He could not bear to think of its being regret for</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Frank. He feared to ask her the cause of her seriousness. He disliked to</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">recall Frank in any manner to her recollection. He wished her to forget</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">him, if possible. At least, _he_ would do so.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Zuleime,” he said, after he had stroked her hair some time, “you know,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">my love, that your aunt Cabell, and your cousins, are going back to</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Richmond to-day.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Are they, sir? I did not know it,” said Zuleime, turning paler, with</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">apprehension of something that might be coming.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Yes, my dear, they are. And, Zuleime—” here he paused—then he went on,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“you have been thinking, I suppose, that you should have to return with</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">them, to enter upon your school duties again, as the first of September</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">is so near.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“I had not thought of it, sir! So many things happening, put it out of</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">my head. But I am quite willing to go, and can be ready in half an</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">hour.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Thank you, my dear child. I am very glad to see you so prompt to oblige</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">me; but, my dear Zuleime, I have good news for you.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Good news, sir?”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Yes, girl! the best news! the _very_ best news! news that young ladies</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">always rejoice to hear!”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“What news, sir?” she asked, fearfully.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Don’t whine, girl! it is not your sentence of death! It is your deed of</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">emancipation! Your ‘free papers,’ as the niggers would say. You are not</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">to return to school any more! Are you not surprised? Are you not</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">rejoiced now?”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Zuleime was not. She was anxious, foreboding.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Why don’t you speak, my dear? Ain’t you glad you’re not going back to</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">school, to leather shoulder braces and back boards, and square and</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">compass rules and regulations, that mean nothing, unless they mean</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">persecution and torture! Say, ain’t you glad?”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“I think I had rather go back to school for the present, sir.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Nonsense, now, my dear! Ah! I see how it is! You want to return with</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">your dear aunt Cabell, and the dear city cousins—especially cousin</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Charley! Eh, you monkey! You grow tired of the country and your old</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">father, as soon as ever your aunt and cousins talk about returning to</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">the city! Ah! you rogue,” said the old man, chucking her under the chin,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">and devoutly praying that he might be right in his conjecture—for, oh!</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">that child’s happiness! It lay nearer his heart than anything else on</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">earth or in heaven.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Dear father!” she said, embracing him, “I do not wish to leave you,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">indeed I do not. I prefer the country. And I had rather _never_ leave</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">you, or my home.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Dear little rogue, now don’t tell me that! I know better you know! And</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">it is quite natural, and nobody blames you. The young bird must leave</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">its nest, and the young girl her home, when she becomes a wife. Your</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">mother left her parents and came home here with her husband. So do not</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">think, my love, that your old father will charge you with selfishness</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">for wishing to leave him—no, not wishing to _leave him_, but wishing to</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">go with one who is to be your husband.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Zuleime dropped her head, to conceal the deadly pallor that crept over</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">her face.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Yes, dear Zuleime, you will soon return to Richmond, though it will be</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">not as a school-girl—but as a happy bride—as Mrs. Major Cabell! What a</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">sonorous name and title for my little, romping Zuleime! Here, Charley</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Cabell! I have broken the ice, now come and speak for yourself!”</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">exclaimed Mr. Clifton to Major Cabell, who was going by the door. Major</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Cabell came in, passing the old gentleman, who had seized his hat, and</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">not trusting himself to look at his daughter, rushed out of the room.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Zuleime remained standing where he had placed her, when he put her off</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">his knee—panic struck—stupid—until Major Cabell took her hand, and</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">attempted to lead her to a seat, then snatching her hand away with a</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">shudder, she asked almost wildly—</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Cousin Charles, when does father want this marriage to come off?”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“As soon as my dearest Zuleime will consent to make me the happiest of</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">men!” replied the common-place wooer, attempting to re-capture her hand,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">but she retreated shuddering, and asking, in a frantic tone and manner,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">in great contrast to her calm words—</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Cousin Charles, do me a favor! Do not press this matter for a week or</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">so.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Heaven forbid that I should hurry a lady, though that lady be my own</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">little cousin and betrothed—only fix the day and I will rest content—so</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">that it is not a far distant day,” he said, re-capturing her hand,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">throwing his arm around her waist, and drawing her towards him.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Please, don’t! Let me go, cousin Charles!” exclaimed the girl, in great</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">distress, struggling to free herself.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“‘Please, don’t let me go, cousin Charles!’ I don’t intend to, pretty</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">cousin, until you tell me when you will give yourself to me!” replied</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Major Cabell, kissing her all the more heartily because she strove to</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">escape.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“You know what I meant! Let me alone! It is unmanly to behave so! Don’t</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">make me hate you!” was on her quivering lips and in her flashing eyes,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">as by a sudden effort she threw his arms off and sat down; but then she</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">recollected her father, and the cruel power Major Cabell seemed to</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">possess over him, and she choked down the indignant words, and said</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">instead—</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Please, don’t hurry and worry me, cousin Charles!—this is so very</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">sudden! I am sure I never dreamed you would ask for poor me for years to</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">come yet. I am so young.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“‘So young!’ Ah, Zuleime, that is a piece of pretty little womanish</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">hypocrisy—a little finesse that belongs to your character, and is</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">inherited from your French mother! ‘So young!’ Now, my pretty childish</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">cousin, you know you have received an offer of marriage this very week!</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">And that, indeed, has accelerated my proposal. Fair Zuleime, a man does</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">not care to see his young betrothed bride courted by another!”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“_I know that!_” replied Zuleime, in a peculiarly sad voice, moving to</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">the other end of the room.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">The slightest gesture of avoidance of him by the girl, seemed to act as</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">a provocative on him, so he followed her, and clasped her in his arms,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">and laughing, almost rudely kissed her, begging her between the kisses</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">not to set his heart on fire by her charming prudery and petulance, but</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">to fix the day, like a good, sensible girl as she was. Almost frantic</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">with rage and shame at being so freely handled, the Clifton blood rushed</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">to her brain, and forgetting her father’s interest and everything else,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">she dashed her hand violently into his face, and before he recovered</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">from his astonishment, broke from him and escaped—her heart beating with</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">one thought—one sudden, joyous thought—that come what might, she never</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">could be either forced or persuaded into a marriage with Major Cabell,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">because she was already a wedded wife—no set of circumstances, whatever,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">could make it her duty, or make it even possible for her to marry Major</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Cabell. In all her sorrows, that was one blessed truth to sit down and</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">rest upon. All her duty was now due to her husband. And with a youthful</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">wife’s enthusiasm firing and strengthening her heart, she thought she</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">should stand as upon a rock, secure against a sea of troubles. Poor</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">child, she had yet to learn that no position founded on a fault is for a</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">moment safe. Several things soon forced themselves upon her memory and</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">grieved her heart;—her father’s unknown but certain danger, her own</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">promise of secrecy in regard to her marriage, the necessity of giving</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">some definite answer to Major Cabell, and the obligation pressing upon</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">her to prevent, by all and any means, the highly improper and extremely</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">offensive demonstrations of passion from her suitor. She determined to</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">write to Frank, tell him all that had occurred, and ask his advice and</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">direction; and to do this it was necessary to gain time, and to give no</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">false promise in the interim. Already was Zuleime beginning to taste the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">bitter fruits of her stolen marriage, and might have exclaimed, in the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">perplexity of her distracted heart and brain—</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2"><span class="Apple-converted-space">                   </span>Oh, what a tangled web we weave,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2"><span class="Apple-converted-space">                   </span>When first we venture to deceive.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">While Zuleime’s heart was beating so fast with many emotions, her father</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">sauntered into the parlor, where he found Major Cabell caressing and</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">soothing his afflicted face.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Well, Charley, boy! How is it with you, eh? Could you win a hearing</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">from my little girl, eh? Give her time, you know, eh?” said the old</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">gentleman, affecting a lightness of heart which he was very far from</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">feeling.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">To his surprise, Major Cabell laughed heartily, still coaxing his</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">ill-used phiz.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“What’s the matter, Charley? What’s amused you, eh?”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Your girl! By my soul, Governor, I shall end in falling seriously in</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">love with that girl! I didn’t fancy her much at first to tell you the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">truth! She was entirely too good humored—always laughing. And I had a</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">fancy for marrying a shrew, just for the spicy fun of taming one! The</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">same instinct, Governor, that makes me like to spring upon the back of</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">the most vicious horse I can find, and ride and lash and spur and</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">fatigue the soul out of his body, until I break his back or his temper,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">one—eh, Governor?”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">The old man’s florid cheeks became pale with rage, and he felt an</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">impulse to kick the puppy out, but a terrible necessity tied his tongue</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">and hands, and Charles Cabell went on laughing and talking to this</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">effect:—</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Now, then, having a fancy to marry and tame a shrew—real live, vicious,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">beautiful vixen—I did not want the spiciest part of the sport taken out</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">of my hands by fathers and mothers and pastors and masters. I shouldn’t</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">have thanked any of you for presenting me with a model wife, already</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">smoothed down and polished to my hand. D—n your pretty pieces of</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">perfection! I’ll none of them—flat, insipid nonentities!—formed and</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">_re_-formed, and modelled, and _re_-modelled, and rubbed down and</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">polished until they all look as much alike as beads on a string! No,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">none of your polished gems for Charles Cabell!—the bright, pure, rough,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">sharp ore! Now, of Zuleime, I thought her far too much educated—too good</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">humored, too polite, too docile, too much of the young ‘lady,’ too</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">little of the wild young animal—and flat and insipid in consequence; so</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">I cared very little about her. But, ha, ha, ha! I never was more</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">mistaken in my life! She’s a prize, I tell you! A prize of the first</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">class! Look you! I coveted a shrew! I’ve found a virago! full of blood</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">and fire! strong and vicious, I tell you! ha, ha, ha! Think of her</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">dashing her little hand in my face when I went to kiss her, and before I</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">recovered my eyesight and senses, throwing me off as if I had been a</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">child, and escaping! Ha, ha, ha! I under-estimated her strength!—Never</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">mind! let the little tigress look out for the next time I get her in my</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">arms!”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">The old man’s bosom was filled to bursting with suppressed passion, but</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">he answered, calmly—</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Oh! she’s young—she’s young, a spoiled child—a spoiled child; be</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">patient with her—she means well—give her time—be patient with her.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“‘Patient, with her!’ Why, uncle, I wouldn’t have her a bit different</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">from what she is! She’s charming, delightful, piquant, spicy! ‘Patient</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">with her!’ Why, Gov’, I shall end in falling desperately in love with</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">her! But I say, nunc! make the little virago fix our marriage day, will</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">you? I have got to go out now and have Spitfire saddled; those fellows</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">never draw the girth tight enough, or fix the bit firm enough—and I have</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">to pull her head off to stop her sometimes, for she is the foul fiend</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">incarnate when she gets to running. I’ll make Zule ride her sometime, to</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">see which will get the better of the other. Say, Gov’, let me have my</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">answer when I get back—do you hear.” And seizing up his riding-whip and</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">cracking it against his boots, he went out.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">The old man boiled over—he clenched his teeth, and shook his fist—nay,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">shook his whole person, as he turned livid with rage; then his arms fell</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">helplessly by his side—he sank into a chair—dropped his face upon his</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">hands, and groaned aloud. He felt a pair of arms encircling his neck,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">and a sweet voice murmuring in his ear—and he raised his head to see</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Zuleime, and to hear her ask in loving tones—</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Father, what is it?”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">He put his hand tenderly around her waist, and drew her gently to his</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">knee, and said, while he gazed remorsefully into her face—</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“I am a villain, Zuleime! A hoary-headed villain!”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Zuleime placed her hand upon his mouth to stop the dreadful words, and</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">pressed her lips to his brow, with a look and manner of the profoundest</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">love and veneration.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Yes, a hardened, persevering sinner, Zuleime! For I intend to</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">persevere! I intend to give you to Charley Cabell, my child,” he said,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">gently removing her hand, and still gazing on her. He continued—“I love</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">you so much, Zuleime! I love you so much! But, dear child. He’s coming!</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Dear child, tell me when you will marry Charley—Tuesday three weeks or</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">four weeks? Don’t let it be longer than four weeks, my girl!”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Father! will you tell me _why_ you wish me to marry cousin Charles?”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“I cannot! I cannot! _My child_, I cannot. It is for your good, I hope!</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Some day I will, perhaps. Tell me now, _that’s_ a good girl. What day</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">will you give this little hand to cousin Charley?”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Father, I can’t possibly give an answer for a week yet, indeed, father,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">I cannot!”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Come, now, nonsense, my child; why can’t you? Here is Charley now!</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">come!”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“I cannot, father!”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">The old gentleman kissed, and coaxed, and almost wept; a manner of</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">attack so hard to be resisted, that had Zuleime been really free, she</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">would have sacrificed her own and Frank’s hopes, and yielded. But</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Zuleime was not free, and therefore was as firmly proof against</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">persuasion, as she would have been against force. Two powerful motives</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">operated in preventing her from confessing her marriage—first her</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">promise to keep it secret, and then the fear of precipitating some</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">violent scene between her father and cousin, or some fatal catastrophe</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">to the household. To end the conflict, and to gain time to consult</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Frank, by writing, was what she most wished now. Finally, she promised</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">to give Major Cabell his answer in a week, and to marry him—_if she</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">should ever marry anybody_.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">With this promise, Major Cabell seemed satisfied—and with his mother and</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">sisters took leave of Clifton. And Zuleime retired to her own room, full</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">of self-reproach for her own deception.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>

<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">A weary week passed away. Zuleime had written to Frank, and Carolyn, we</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">already know, had despatched a letter to Archer. But the week had passed</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">away, and no answer to either had come from Winchester. Had the sisters</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">confided in each other, such mutual confidence might have soothed the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">soul-sickening anxiety of _one_ at least. Carolyn would have known that</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">some accident _must_ have prevented Frank Fairfax from receiving or</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">answering the momentous letter of his youthful wife, and she would have</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">felt that the same cause had probably operated in the case of Archer</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Clifton. But the sisters did not entrust their secrets to each other.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Zuleime was withheld by her sacred promise. Carolyn by her pride. But</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">the wife bore the pain of suspense far better than the maiden. The wife</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">had perfect faith in her young husband, and knew that some adverse</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">chance had hindered his getting or replying to her letter. The maiden</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">knew that she had unjustly banished her lover. And she had no faith in</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">the love that endureth all things. Carolyn had never suspected the depth</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">of that calm, secure, habitual affection—which had from childhood</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">grown—until now. While life and love and hope had flowed smoothly on,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">her emotions were serene and moderate. But now that the quiet stream had</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">been stemmed by rocks and breakers, it was lashed into fury and roared</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">in whirlpools. The calm sentiment rose to turbulent, maddening passion.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Her days were restless, her nights sleepless, until, as the week wore</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">away, her nerves were wrought to such severity of tension, that you</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">might know that at the end of uncertainty, whether that were joy or</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">sorrow, they must alike suddenly give way. Towards the last of the week,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">she had privately besought her father to ride to Winchester, and see the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">detachment off, and bring her the last news of it. The request had been</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">confidential—yet do you feel all that it had cost her haughty heart?</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">During the absence of Mr. Clifton, suspense was wrought up to agony. Her</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">days and nights were feverish, delirious, and so confused into each</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">other, that she scarcely knew the fitful, disturbed visions of the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">night, from the wild and anxious broodings of the day. The day upon</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">which her father was expected back, was the acme, the crisis of her</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">suffering. Oblivious of pride and caution, careless of exposing herself</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">to the malign sneers of Georgia, or the rude comments of the servants,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">she sat in the piazza, watching the road by which the carriage should</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">come—one wild, anxious, despairing hope possessing her. “The drowning</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">catch at straws”—and she, in her despair, had clutched one mad</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">possibility, and clung to it, until to her weakened, confused, insane</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">soul, it seemed a probability, and then almost a certainty. It was the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">hope that Clifton might return with her father! Oh, yes! That Clifton</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">might resign his commission and come back to her. Oh! if indeed he loved</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">her, as he had a thousand times sworn, if he sorrowed over their</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">estrangement only half as much as she did, no hope of glory, no fear of</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">disgrace would keep him back. The more she brooded over this, the more</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">likely, the more certain it appeared to be. And she sat and gazed up the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">dim forest road.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">The sun sank to the edge of the horizon, and lit up all the mountain</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">tops with fire, and then went down. And when she could no longer see,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">she still sat and strained her ear to catch the distant sound of wheels.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">The moon arose, and flooded all the mountain scenery with silver light,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">and flashed upon that distant bend of the river, until it seemed a</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">silver lake, lying among the dark hills, and pointed the peaks of White</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Cliffs, until they stood up and glittered, like an enormous row of</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">spears, against the deep blue sky.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">At last, at last the very distant sound of wheels came faintly like a</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">doubt to her ear, and faded away again. Then it came more distinctly,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">nearer, and a moving object appeared upon the road. And she knew indeed</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">it was her father’s carriage. She saw and recognized it in the moon</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">light. It turned into the lawn gate, rolled rapidly around the circular</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">drive, and swept swiftly up to the entrance, where it stopped. The steps</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">were let down, the door opened, and old Mr. Clifton got out, followed</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">by—no one.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Carolyn had bent eagerly, unconsciously forward; now she started up and</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">caught her father’s hand, and gazed silently, imploringly into his face,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">for the news she could not ask for.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“The detachment has marched, my dear child! Marched the morning of the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">day upon which I reached Winchester, and two days before it was expected</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">to have gone. So, you see, I could not get a sight of either Frank or</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Archer. They were thirty miles on their road before I reached the city.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Can’t think what could have been the reason of the new order, to</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">anticipate their departure by two days. However! cheer up! No use</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">fretting, my dear! No use fretting! The family have supped long ago, of</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">course—have they kept my supper hot for me? I am as hungry as an old</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">wolf,” said the old man.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Carolyn did not hear him. Her hold relaxed upon his arm, her hands flew</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">up to her head, and she turned, as one struck with sudden blindness, and</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">tottered into the house. It was so dark in the shady piazza, screened</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">from the moonbeams by interlacing cypress vines, that the old man did</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">not see her state. He hastened into the house, where another awaited him</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">with equal anxiety.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Zuleime’s private hope had been that Frank would seize the opportunity</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">of Mr. Clifton’s visit, and confess his marriage, and invent some way of</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">delivering her father from the toils of Major Cabell.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“What news, father?” she asked, meeting him in the hall.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“‘What news?’ Why, I am as hungry as a bear, my pet! That’s the news! I</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">stopped to supper at L——. But, my life! They like to have poisoned me</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">with _fried_ beefsteaks and heavy biscuits and green coffee. Couldn’t</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">touch a morsel, child! And now I am starved up to a savage pitch! What</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">have you got for supper?”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Turtle soup and old crusted port, among other things, father,” replied</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Zuleime, waving her own anxiety for the sake of satisfying him.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“TURTLE SOUP! And OLD CRUSTED PORT;” exclaimed the old man, in an</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">ecstacy of delight. “Why, where on earth did they come from?”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“The turtle came from a ship at Norfolk, and was sent hither by Major</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Cabell, who added a dozen of port of his own importation,” said Zuleime,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">dying with anxiety to hear from Frank.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Ah-h-h-h! _That_ was kind! _He’s_ a fellow! He’ll make a magnificent</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">husband and son-in-law, Zuleime! I hope you know how turtle soup should</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">be made?”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Father, I know it should be eaten quite _hot_, and it is on the table</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">by this time. Come in.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">The old man needed no pressing, but went into the dining-room, and sat</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">down at the table, with a face radiant with delight. Zuleime waited on</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">him, although there was a servant in attendance. And when he had freely</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">partaken of turtle soup, devilled crabs, a roasted fowl, etc., washed</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">them down with port wine, she brought him a cup of fragrant Mocha coffee</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">and his case of cigars. And he sipped the coffee with an air of infinite</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">leisure, and then lit a cigar and puffed slowly away, as if eternity was</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">before him.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Father, what news from Winchester?” again asked Zuleime, though her</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">hopes had fallen very low. “What news, dear father?”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“What’s that to you, my pet? Will you let me digest my supper in peace?”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Zuleime sat down, but looked so anxious, that her very _looks_ worried</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">the old gentleman, and he said—</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Don’t you know, girl, that indigestion is very dangerous to a man of my</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">time of life? It may bring on apoplexy! Don’t worry me!”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Zuleime veiled her anxious gaze, but even then the paleness of her</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">cheeks annoyed her father, and he testily inquired—</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Now, what is it to you? I can understand Carolyn’s anxiety. I cannot</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">comprehend yours at all! There, now. Go and send my wife to me!”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Zuleime arose to obey, but before she went, she threw her arms around</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">his neck, and asked—</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Dearest father, _only_ tell me! Were our friends well? Have they gone?</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Did they send any message?”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Only answer you three questions at a time! That is reasonable! However,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">I can answer all in one. I have not seen our friends. Their detachment</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">left Winchester twelve hours before I reached there. And now I’ll tell</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">you what I did not like to tell Carolyn, poor girl! Namely, that the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">detachment marched two days earlier than was intended, upon account of</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">dispatches received from Fort ——, praying for speedy succor in a</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">reinforcement. The savages have been massacreing and scalping there at a</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">most tremendous rate! It is really a very dangerous service, Indian</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">warfare! God grant that our young friends may return to us safe! Why</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">don’t you go along and tell Georgia to come to me?”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Zuleime kissed her father, settled the cushion under his feet, and went</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">on her errand. That dispatched, she sought her own chamber, and lay down</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">to collect her thoughts. No letter or message from her husband, and her</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">promise of secrecy in regard to her marriage, binding on her as ever.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">And next week she must give an answer to her father for Major Cabell.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">She was confident that one of two things had happened. Either her letter</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">had never reached Frank, or else his answer had been lost. And by the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">transaction only one week’s respite had she gained for her father—for</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">next week her refusal must be decided and final, and then—what might not</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">the consequence be to him? These thoughts excited her mind, and kept her</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">awake. And despite her determination to sleep, and her efforts to do so,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">she heard every passing hour strike. It was soon after one o’clock that</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">she had fallen into a fitful slumber, when she was awakened by the sound</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">of a gay, high voice, intermingling merry words and joyous laughter.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Indeed, there seemed to be not only one, but many voices, talking and</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">laughing in the most jocund manner. And strange—passing strange! it</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">seemed to come from her sister’s room, which adjoined hers! She listened</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">awhile; the words became fewer, but the laughter grew wilder! And then</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">it struck upon her frightened senses that Carolyn was a maniac, talking,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">laughing to herself! Springing from her bed, and without even waiting to</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">slip on a gown, she ran into the passage and knocked at her sister’s</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">door, and attempted to push it open. It was locked on the inside, and</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">all her efforts to force an entrance were vain, and all her entreaties</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">for admission were answered by peals of unconscious laughter. At last</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">she ran to her father’s door, and rapped loudly, exclaiming—</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Father, father! Get up! get up! Something, I am sure, has happened to</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Carolyn! Something dreadful! Get up! get up!”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">The old man was hard to awaken, even by the efforts of Georgia, who was</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">aroused at once, and came and opened the door for Zuleime! And all this</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">time the sound of loud talk, high laughter, and wild snatches of song,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">as from several excited people, rather than from one, issued from</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Carolyn’s chamber. At length, by the united exertions of his wife and</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">daughter, the fatigued and drowsy old gentleman was aroused and placed</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">upon his feet, and made to</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2"><span class="Apple-converted-space">                  </span>“Understand a horror in their words—</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2"><span class="Apple-converted-space">                  </span>If not the words.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">He threw on his shawl gown and hastened to Carolyn’s door, which was</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">instantly forced open.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">And what a sight met their eyes!</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">There stood Miss Clifton arrayed in her gorgeous bridal costume, looking</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">gloriously beautiful, though certainly as no bride ever looked before!</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">The raging fever had given the brightness and richness of the carnation</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">rose to her complexion, and imparted a supernatural light to her eyes,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">that burned and flashed, and seemed to strike fire as they sprang from</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">one to the other of the intruders, with a mad, joyous, defiant glance!</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">The alarm of her father was unlimited, unspeakable! He darted from the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">room, and almost precipitated himself down the stairs in his haste to</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">mount and dispatch a servant for the family physician. And while he was</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">gone, Georgia and Zuleime, by coaxing and humoring the phantasy of the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">poor girl, succeeded in undressing her and putting her to bed—she still</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">raving about her marriage, and sometimes breaking out into a wild laugh,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">and once telling Georgia that _she_, being a married woman, had no right</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">or business to be officiating as bridesmaid.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">It was near morning when the doctor came. After examining the state of</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">the patient, he pronounced her disease to be brain fever, brought on by</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">over-excitement of the nervous system. He wrote prescriptions, and</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">remained with her until they were administered. And then he departed</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">with a promise to return early in the forenoon.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Mrs. Clifton, of Hardbargain, was summoned, and lost no time in</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">hastening to the sick room of her daughter-in-law, as she chose to call</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Carolyn.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">For many days the struggle between life and death went on, and no one,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">not even the medical attendant, was able to form an opinion as to which</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">power would eventually conquer.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Mrs. Clifton had taken her station by the bedside of the patient as</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">permanent nurse, and she constantly refused to yield her post to any</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">other person. And it was to her vigilant attention, quick perceptions,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">and intelligent treatment, that all the family ascribed the recovery of</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">the girl. For the crisis came and passed, and Carolyn Clifton lived.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">But no sooner was the patient pronounced out of danger, and the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">excitement of anxiety over, than the nurse herself fell ill. And Mrs.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Clifton, exhausted, prostrated, entered her carriage, and was driven to</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Hardbargain.</span></p>

<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">As soon as Mrs. Clifton reached home—leaning on the arm of her maid, she</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">walked up stairs and entered her son’s deserted room, and when her</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">attendant had relieved her of scarf and bonnet, she lay down upon his</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">lounge, and sent Henny for Kate Kavanagh. In less than half an hour Kate</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">entered. And the lady turned to her and said—</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Catherine, my dear, I must take you into my confidence—yes, and into</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">other people’s, too, whether they approve it or not. Draw Archer’s</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">writing-desk up here to the side of the lounge. I want you to write a</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">letter to him.” Catherine’s brow crimsoned, and she trembled very much</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">as she obeyed. “My dear Catherine, I am sure you will be discreet, and</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">never speak of what I am about to entrust to you. I can rely on you?”</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">said the lady, interrogatively, raising those fever-brightened dark eyes</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">to the girl’s face. Catherine nodded quickly, in her usual way, when the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">words would not come. “You see, my dear child, this most unhappy quarrel</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">between Carolyn and Archer, is causing a great deal of unnecessary</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">suffering to both—and Carolyn, as the frailer of the two, is nearly</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">dying under it. Her brain fever was caused by it. And it was as much as</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Dr. Barnes and myself could do, to bring her safely through it with life</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">and reason. This estrangement between them must not continue, or she</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">_will_ die. She is not so strong as she looks to be. Indeed, she is very</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">delicate, like her mother. Archer is far on his Western march now, and</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">cannot return of course; but he must write to her, and comfort her. I</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">wish you to write and tell him so. Now, then, child, you know the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">object. Open the desk, and lay out the paper, while I try to think what</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">I want said, and how I want you to say it.” Catherine’s hands quivered</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">as she turned down the leaf of the desk, and mechanically laid the paper</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">out on the top. “Just date it, dear child, and then I will tell you how</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">to begin.” Catherine dipped her pen in ink, and was just about to put it</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">to paper, when something there caught and held her eyes, and she gazed</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">with dilating pupils, and trembled more than ever.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">The paper before her was covered with a water-colored sketch of</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Marguerite, of France, at the siege of Damietta. And the ideal face of</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">the royal heroine, was the real one of the humble Catherine herself. And</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">in the corner of the paper were the initials A. C. He had taken _her_</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">homely features as his notion of those of the heroic Queen of St. Louis.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">And as she gazed, her heart shuddered with a strange, wild emotion of</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">blended wonder, joy and remorse. The nature of the maiden was becoming</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">vaguely intelligible to herself.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">And Mrs. Clifton did not see her trance, but lay upon the sofa very</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">weary, with her hands pressed upon her temples, trying to settle in what</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">manner she should address her son upon this delicate subject. And</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Catherine forgot everything in the sketch before her, and the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">tumultuous, blissful, painful emotions it excited. An abyss was suddenly</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">thrown open in the depths of her heart, whose existence was unsuspected</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">till now. _Now_ was she sorry that the marriage between Archer Clifton</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">and his cousin, was broken off—by mutual consent? She tried very</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">earnestly to feel sorry, for she believed it her duty to be so. She</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">forced herself to remember Carolyn’s illness, and Archer’s own</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">suffering, in consequence of the estrangement between them. But, oh!</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">there lay that picture before her eyes, with her own plain face</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">idealized, glorified up to a high, pure, divine beauty, such as it had</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">never, even in her highest, holiest, most inspired moods, possessed. And</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">a voice from her profound heart whispered—“Oh, yes, and he could make me</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">really beautiful and glorious as his ideal there—for he could make me</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">good, and glad, and great beyond whatever I could make myself—if he</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">chose!” She reproached her heart severely for its seductive whisper. She</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">offered up a silent prayer to God to forgive her, and save her soul from</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">secret sin. She called herself foolish, presumptuous, treacherous. But,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">oh! in spite of all these, would sparkle up from the depths of her</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">spirit, sprays of gladness, as if there had suddenly sprung within an</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">everlasting fountain of joy. Yet again she blamed herself most bitterly.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">She repeated that despairing complaint or confession of David—“The heart</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">is deceitful above all things, and desperately wicked.” She almost</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">realized its truth. She silently cried to God to enter her heart, and</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">expel its secret sin.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Well, child! are you ready!” inquired Mrs. Clifton, withdrawing her</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">hands from her temples, and looking towards the entranced girl. Kate did</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">not hear or see, her soul and senses were absorbed in the subject before</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">her. Yet she did not think or hope about the future. It was the present,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">the present that absorbed her heart, despite of will, resistance and</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">conscience.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Kate! are you asleep or in a trance?” asked the lady, gazing at her.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">The maiden started, and blushed deeply.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Catherine! what are you thinking of?” she repeated, fixing her dark</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">eyes upon the girl, until they seemed to burn into her soul.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Kate looked guilty and bewildered, recovering herself by an effort, and</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">answered, almost at random—</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“This is not letter paper, madam, it is Bristol board.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Oh, well! there is writing paper in the other department of the desk,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">my child, get it out.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Kate examined the contents of the desk, and then replied—</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“There is no letter paper here, whatever, Mrs. Clifton.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“What are those?”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Only card boards and sketches, madam.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Sketches. That is just like Archer, to keep his sketches in his writing</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">desk. His writing material will no doubt be found in his portfolio. But</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">let me see those sketches, Catherine; I have not seen them yet, and they</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">will be something new to me—almost like a recent letter from Archer. I</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">like to look over his drawings; they always mean something apart from</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">their subject, as it seems to me. I often think his sketches form a</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">running commentary, though an involuntary one, on his life and thoughts!</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Hand them to me, my child.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“These are only old historical subjects,” said Kate, with visible</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">reluctance to produce them.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Pass them over to me, my dear. If their subjects are as old as the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Chinese History of the Creation, they will nevertheless be eloquent to</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">me of my son’s present mood—of the state of his heart, and the progress</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">or the retrogression of his mind. You cannot imagine, Catherine, the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">anxious curiosity of a mother to catch furtive glimpses of the interior</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">of that heart she cannot always enter, and which is often hidden, too,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">from its possessor! ‘We know not what manner of spirit we are of,’</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Catherine. For instance, do you know your own heart or mind? In all</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">hearts lie depths below depths, never known to the owner until some</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">earthquake of sorrow, or of passion, throw them open to view! There are</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">in all minds powers beyond powers of achievement or of endurance,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">unsuspected by their possessor until some emergency calls them into</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">action! But give me the drawings, Kate, they will refresh me like a talk</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">with Archer.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Catherine lifted them, _en masse_, and handed them to Mrs. Clifton, who</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">took and examined each separately and leisurely.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Um-m-me,” she said, smiling gently, as she recognized their</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">subjects:—“‘Marguerite of France, at the Siege of Damietta,’ ‘Joan of</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Arc, at Rheims,’ ‘Margaret of Anjou, at St. Albans,’ ‘Last interview of</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Lord and Lady Russel,’ and all these battle-axe heroines, wearing the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">likeness of my serious, domestic Catherine! In truth, Archer has put you</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">through as many characters and costumes as though he designed you for a</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">tragic actress, in the heaviest line.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Kate Kavanagh did not like that.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“But two of these characters bear any affinity to you, my dear. I cannot</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">fancy any similitude between the tender and fiery Marguerite—that</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">‘falcon-hearted dove,’ or her haughty and remorseless namesake of Anjou,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">and my grave, gentle Catherine. But the high and holy enthusiasm</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">irradiating Joan’s face, and the noble resignation of Lady Russel’s</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">countenance, suit your striking features very well. But I am talking</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">like a mediocre stage critic. Captain Clifton has a very high opinion,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">of you, my Catherine. Pray try to merit it, my dear girl!” concluded the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">lady, with a little pardonable motherly pride.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Kate Kavanagh looked down, and fingered the pens and wafers, for she</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">felt the lady’s eyes gazing through and through her—reading her very</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">soul.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“By the way, Catherine, have you seen Captain Clifton’s last work of</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">art?”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“No, madam.” (I wonder why she calls him “Captain Clifton” to _me_—she</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">never did so before, thought Kate.)</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“It is a highly finished miniature of Miss Clifton, painted on ivory. He</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">had it set in a plain gold locket, and has taken it away with him. I saw</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">him hang it around his neck, and lay it near his heart.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Catherine honestly believed that she was glad to hear this, for it</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">seemed one more stay to keep her thoughts right.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“And that, Catherine, is one reason among many others I have, for</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">knowing his indestructible love for Carolyn. And that is why I feel no</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">hesitation in having this letter written, to end this foolish quarrel,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">and to restore peace to these two unhappy young people,” said Mrs.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Clifton, looking, Catherine thought, very strangely at her—_so_</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">strangely, that the maiden felt her cheeks burn with a vague sense of</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">humiliation.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">She asked herself—Could Mrs. Clifton have read what had been passing in</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">her mind? Well! if so—that was another band to bind her thoughts to the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">right.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Now, then, to your task, my child. You will find paper in Captain</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Clifton’s portfolio.” She spoke gently as ever to Kate, but still called</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">her son “Captain Clifton,” as if to widen the distance between them.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Kate felt troubled at this, and then took herself to task for a state of</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">mind so morbidly acute to impressions, that she noticed everything, even</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">that trifle. She searched and found the writing materials in the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">portfolio, and went to work and wrote, from Mrs. Clifton’s dictation, a</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">letter, full of gentle rebuke, and kind, motherly counsel, to Archer</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Clifton. And all to the end that he should write immediately, and</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">reconcile himself to Carolyn, who was extremely ill, and whom his mother</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">felt assured, she said, that he must be most anxious to propitiate. The</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">letter was sealed and dispatched, and the lady, thoroughly worn out, and</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">leaning upon the arm of Catherine, sought her own bed-chamber.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">The next morning, Mrs. Clifton was so weary that she could only leave</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">her bed-chamber to lie upon the sofa in the shady parlor, where she</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">could be at hand to direct the operations of her house servants—now</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">engaged in cutting out and making up the Fall clothing for the negroes.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Catherine came early to assist in this onerous task. It was in the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">afternoon while the lady was still reclining on the sofa, and Catherine</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">standing at a work-table basting a linsey-woolsey frock-body—when a</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">horse was heard to gallop up into the yard, a man to jump off and hasten</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">up the steps of the piazza, and the instant after, old Mr. Clifton</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">entered the parlor, looking very much flurried and alarmed.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“What is the matter? I hope Carolyn is no worse?” asked the lady,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">anxious, yet calm.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“No! Yes! A great deal better of course since the turn last night! Most</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">malignant form of the disease, and growing rapidly worse every hour. _I</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">tell you it is!_ The doctor affirms it!”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Mrs. Clifton gazed at him in a sort of self-possessed perplexity.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“She has got the small-pox, madam.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“The small-pox!”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Yes, madam, the confluent small-pox, in its worst form.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“You astonish me! I trust—I believe you are mistaken!”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“No—I wish to Heaven I was! No, madam! Doctor’s opinion!”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Why, how on earth. Sit down, Mr. Clifton! Kate, my dear, wheel that</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">arm-chair around.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Catherine obeyed, and the old gentleman sank among its soft cushions,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">and took out his pocket-handkerchief and wiped his face.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“How on earth could she have got it?” asked Mrs. Clifton.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Ah! Lord Almighty knows! Came spontaneously, I do suppose! You noticed</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">those two pimples that appeared upon her forehead after the crisis of</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">her fever passed?”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Yes; but I thought nothing of them.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Nor did we at the time. But at any rate, that was the first appearance</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">of the eruption—little as we guessed it at the time. You see, she</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">naturally began to grow better when this other disease began to break</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">out, I suppose. Indeed, I have no doubt it was the coming of the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">small-pox, that arrested the fatal termination of the brain fever. Well,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">you see, last night after you had left her so much better, we entrusted</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">her to the care of Zuleime, who did not seem to be so much worn out with</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">watching as the rest of us. So Zuleime sat up with her; and she tells me</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">that before midnight her face was sprinkled all over with those pimples.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">And this morning, when I first saw her—” The old man’s voice broke down</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">for a moment. “Oh! it was dreadful! Her beautiful, fair face, neck,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">bosom, arms, all covered over with that horrible eruption! It had all</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">run together in one mass. We sent off to hasten the arrival of the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">doctor, who, when he came, pronounced the disease to be confluent</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">small-pox. Oh, it is horrible! horrible, even, if her life be spared!</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Disfigured for life! What a fate for a woman! I drove Zuleime out of the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">room against her will—for she, dear, generous girl, wished to stay and</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">tend her sister. Georgia told me at breakfast, that she had just got a</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">letter from her father, who was ill—and that she must have the carriage</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">to go to Richmond. She did not show me the letter, for she made haste</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">and started almost immediately. Everything falls out disastrously at</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">once. Now, what am I to do? I cannot procure a nurse to that disease,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">for love or money, in this neighborhood. Advise me what to do. The</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">necessity is so urgent!”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Mrs. Clifton was now sitting up, supporting her head upon her hand, and</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">essaying her strength.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“I must go back, and nurse Carolyn myself.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“You! Now, never suppose, my dear sister, that I have been hinting for</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">you to return and finish killing yourself for us! I would not permit it,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">if you wished it ever so much! I’ll lock and bar the doors and windows,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">to keep you out, first. But think and counsel me as to the best thing to</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">be done. There is no one at home but Zuleime—and even if I were willing</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">she should risk taking the dreadful disease, she is so very young and</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">inexperienced that I should be afraid to trust her sister’s safety in</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">her hands. But I am not willing that she should run any risk to</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">_herself_—that’s flat. But what’s to be done?”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“There is not a servant on your plantation, or on this farm, fit to be</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">trusted in such a case. I must go and take care of my daughter myself!”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“D—d if you shall, ma’am! I’ll bar my doors and windows against you,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">first, I tell you! Why, in your weak state, it would be suicide!”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">The lady maintained her purpose against Mr. Clifton’s vehement</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">opposition, and her calm persistence must have conquered, but Kate</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Kavanagh mildly interposed, by saying—</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Let me go.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“You!” exclaimed Mr. and Mrs. Clifton, in a breath.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Yes; I am not a bad nurse. I have had considerable experience with sick</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">people.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“But—you’ve never had the small-pox—you’re not the least marked!” said</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Mr. Clifton.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“No, sir, I have never had that disease!”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“And you are willing to risk taking it?”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Yes, sir!”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“What! and you a young girl! Ain’t you afraid of catching it, and having</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">your face spoiled?”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Yes, sir, I am afraid of contracting it.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Why that is a plain contradiction of yourself; you say you are willing</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">to risk it, and afraid of catching it. I do not understand you at all.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Catherine is so simply truthful and straight-forward!” said the lady,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">smiling; “she means that she is perfectly conscious of the extent of the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">danger of contagion, but that she thinks it her duty to brave it,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">nevertheless! Is not that it, my dear? But, Catherine, much as we thank</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">you for your generous self-devotion, we must not permit you to think of</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">going. I must do that, for I have had the disease. If you were to</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">persist in your purpose, my dear girl, you would almost certainly get</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">the small-pox, and then your life, or at the very least, your beauty,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">would be sacrificed.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Beauty!—If I had it and were to lose it, dear lady, there is no one to</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">care for it!”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Yes, _I_ should care for it, my Kate,” said the lady, putting her arm</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">around the girl’s waist, and drawing her closer.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“In fine, my good girl, you shall not go if you are afraid! That’s</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">certain!” said Mr. Clifton.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Oh, sir, that would not interfere with the faithful discharge of my</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">duties as nurse. You had best let me go, and go at once, sir! There is</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">no time to be lost, surely. Is any competent person with Miss Clifton</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">now, sir?”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“No one but a colored woman, and I really _must_ hurry back. And, so if</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">you really _do_ feel disposed to go, my dear girl,—is she a good nurse,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Mrs. Clifton?”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Excellent, sir! But indeed I do not like her exposing herself in my</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">stead. I should not permit her to do it, indeed, if my power seconded my</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">will,” added the lady, sinking back fatigued upon her sofa cushions.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Old Mr. Clifton was evidently inclined to accept Kate’s services. Mrs.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Clifton was obliged to yield,—more to the weakness that overpowered her</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">frame than to the arguments set forth by Catherine. It was settled,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">then, that Kate should go. And she quickly put on her little straw</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">bonnet and black silk scarf, and entered the gig that the old gentleman</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">borrowed from the lady to convey the girl to Clifton.</span></p>

<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">The mansion-house at White Cliffs was all but deserted. The very house</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">servants, pretty mulatto girls, more afraid of destroying their good</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">looks than losing their lives, had retreated to their own dens, feigning</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">illness as an excuse to keep out of the reach of contagion. Catherine</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">was introduced at once into the sick room. That sick room! What mind can</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">conceive, or what pen _should_ describe it. Only those who have nursed a</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">patient through that worst form of the most loathsome pestilence, can</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">realize its revolting horrors. To see any human being looking as the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">once beautiful Carolyn now looked. Her very features almost obliterated,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">while——fill up the pause, you who have seen the horrors of that pest. It</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">was worse than any form of illness—it was worse than death and decay.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Disgust almost overmastered pity, and Catherine turned away, shuddering</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">with sickness of body and soul. Old Mr. Clifton cast one agonized look</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">upon the ruin, and unable to bear the sight, rushed from the room.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Catherine turned to her duty. The wretched patient was tossing about in</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">high fever, and tearing her arms and bosom under the intolerable</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">irritation. That work of destruction must be stopped first Catherine</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">knew. Catherine caught her right hand, and it took all her strength to</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">hold that hand, whose flesh seemed as if it would drop off, under the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">pressure, while she secured it to the bedstead. Then she captured the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">other dashing, tossing hand, and confined it in the same manner. And</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">then she looked at the state of her own palms. Oh, offensive duty! No</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">wonder, she thought, that the beautiful Georgia had fled to Richmond,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">and the two pretty house-maids were extremely ill in their attic! Had</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">_she_ a wish to follow their example? No—for now all selfish fears were</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">lost in deep compassion for the poor, forsaken wreck of beauty, that lay</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">there at her mercy. She returned to her duty. She administered to her</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">patient an opiate, to soothe her restlessness. Took a sponge and tepid</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">water, and thoroughly cleansed the surface of the skin, and anointed</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">face, bosom and arms with a fragrant emollient, to allay the intolerable</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">itching. She then released her hands, and laid them easily upon the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">counterpane. Lastly, she ventilated and darkened the chamber, and took</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">her seat by the bedside, to fan her patient while she slept. And deep</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">was her satisfaction in watching that quiet, refreshing sleep. It is not</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">my intention to lead my reader through the dismal days that followed in</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">that sick room, until the “secondary fever,” the crisis of the disease,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">came and passed. Catherine nursed her patient tenderly, faithfully,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">night and day. Carolyn’s life was spared, but her peerless beauty was</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">gone forever. Her luxuriant, fair hair was all lost, and her head was as</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">bald and discolored as her face—and that!</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">In that darkened chamber, and in the midst of physical suffering and</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">weakness, Carolyn had had no opportunity of ascertaining the extent of</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">the ravages the disease had made in her beauty—if indeed she knew the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">nature of the former, or thought about the latter. But as she</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">convalesced, and became able to sit up in bed and converse, she felt an</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">invalid’s childish curiosity to look in the glass, and frequently</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">requested her gentle nurse to hand her one. But Catherine, dreading the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">effect of the shock, steadily refused to comply with her wishes in that</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">respect, and perseveringly kept the room darkened. And the sick girl,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">too weak to persist long in any controversy, yielded the point.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">But one day, while Catherine was at her breakfast, and old Darkey</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">supplying her place by the bedside of the patient, Carolyn said in a</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">tone that admitted of no denial, or even delay—</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Darkey, hand me that hand-glass from my dressing-table.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">And the old woman impulsively, thoughtlessly obeyed her, and brought it.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Carolyn was propped up in bed. She took the mirror, gave one interested</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">look into it—plucked off her little cap—gave another hurried glance—and</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">uttering a long, low cry of despair, sunk back insensible upon her</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">pillow.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Old Darkey flew from the chair to the patient, and from the patient to</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">the bell, in great trepidation—ringing peals that brought all the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">household hurrying in alarm to the room. Old Mr. Clifton, being nearest</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">at hand, arrived first. And when he saw and understood what had</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">happened, he seized the hand-glass, and threw it out of the window, and</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">laid hold of the heavy toilet mirror, and sent it flying after. Then he</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">drove old Darkey from the room, forbidding her, for a stupid and</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">dangerous maniac, ever to show her face there again. And all this time,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Catherine, who had entered so quietly that no one saw or heard her, was</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">silently trying to restore the swooning girl. As Carolyn, with a deep</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">sigh, opened her eyes, Kate motioned for every one to leave the chamber.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">And all noiselessly withdrew. Carolyn shivered and shuddered several</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">times, as she raised her eyes appealingly, despairingly to Catherine,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">who was bending tenderly over her. Catherine thought it best to answer</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">that silent appeal by speaking at once to the point.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“My dear Miss Clifton, you must not think that your face will continue</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">to look anything like it does now, for it will not, indeed. For though</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">it is very much discolored, it is not much pitted, and the discoloration</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">will wear off in a few days. And as for your hair, Miss Clifton, that</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">will grow out very soon, and be even more beautiful and luxuriant than</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">before, on account of the renewal of the skin—so, dear lady, take</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">comfort and do not look in the glass again until you are better.” And</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">all this time that Catherine spoke in this gentle manner, she was</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">bathing the girl’s face and hands with bay water, and her tender touch</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">was even more soothing than the sedative liquid. Catherine was almost</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">impelled to say—“Have patience—bow to the will of God, and try to learn</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">the lesson He intends to teach in this.” But she felt the hour had not</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">come for speaking such words. That she herself must have patience and</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">wait for the time when she might minister to her spiritual need.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Up to this period, Miss Clifton did not know who her nurse was. She had</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">heard her called “My dear child,” or “My good girl,” by the physician</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">and by her father, and they were the only visitors to the room, except</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">old Darkey, who came to relieve the nurse at meal times, and who simply</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">called her “Miss.” And if once or twice she had heard her called</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Catherine—still she never imagined her to be Kate Kavanagh, but some</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">hired attendant. And, indeed, in the languor of illness she thought</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">nothing about it. A few days after this, however, when she had grown</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">more composed and resigned, and while she lay watching Catherine’s quiet</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">movements through the room, she said—</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“My dear, good girl—my gentle nurse—tell me your name? I _do_ pray</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">sometimes, and I wish to know your name that I may ask God to bless you</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">for exposing life and health and beauty for one whom mother, and sister,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">and servants all deserted.” Just now, for the first time, it flashed</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">like lightning through Kate’s mind that all the danger of infection was</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">over, and that she might now thank God for preserving her from</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">contagion. Yes! she had forgotten herself for some time past, but now</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">her heart leaped for joy and gratitude, and she thanked God before she</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">replied to Miss Clifton’s question, and said—</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“My name is Catherine Kavanagh.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“So!—you are Kate Kavanagh! Hoist up the blind. Come to me. Let me look</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">at you,” said Miss Clifton, raising on her elbow. Smiling, because</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">unconscious of the hidden meaning in her words, Catherine approached and</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">sat down by her bed. And Carolyn took both her hands, and</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2"><span class="Apple-converted-space">                </span>“Fell to the perusing of her face,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2"><span class="Apple-converted-space">                </span>As though she’d learn it off by heart.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">She pored over the broad, square forehead, looking strong, but not</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">beautiful, for all the bright chestnut hair was pushed carelessly</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">aside—she gazed upon those dark gray eyes under their long black</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">fringes—such deep, transparent wells of darkness and light they were—she</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">dwelt upon the beautiful lips, and then her glance roved over the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">symmetrical form. And she thought she had never seen so perfect a</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">figure. And she sighed and raised her eyes again to the remarkable</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">countenance, with its large features, pale and cadaverous now with a</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">long season of confinement, fatigue and loss of sleep, and grave with</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">thought, and earnest with deep feeling. And she could not settle it to</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">her satisfaction whether Kate Kavanagh was a sublime beauty or a fright.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Upon the whole, the girl interested and pained her. And she continued to</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">hold her hands with a nervous grasp, and pore over her face and form as</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">freely as though she had been only a dreadfully fascinating statue—while</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Kate blushed under the infliction, and finally drew her hands away and</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">sat down.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">But every day Miss Clifton’s confidence in, and esteem for Kate</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Kavanagh, increased. And every day Catherine sought to draw her</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">patient’s soul to the only true source of light, strength and</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">consolation; and to sanctify this terrible affliction to her spirit’s</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">good. The obligation to do this pressed upon the girl’s conscience</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">heavily, as if it were the hand of God. It was in vain that she said to</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">herself, “I am nothing but a weak, erring girl. It would be presumption</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">in me to speak. It might be received as impertinence, and do more harm</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">than good.” Still the answer arose from the depths of her heart,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">saying—“Speak the fitting words at the fitting time, as they arise</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">within your mind, for they are the inspiration of God’s spirit.” And</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">wisely, lovingly, reverently she spoke them as occasion called them</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">forth. The right thing was always said at the moment it was needed.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Words spoken in season are like apples of gold on plates of silver.”</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Many a willing but bungling Christian would have failed to do Carolyn</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">any good, for Miss Clifton was a very difficult subject. There is</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">nothing so hard of impression as pride and scorn and jealousy. It was</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">the dominion of that infernal triumvirate that made Lucifer an</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">impracticable subject among the angels. But Catherine was moved and</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">guided by a higher power than herself. Of herself she dared say nothing</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">on Divine subjects. She only spoke when strongly, irresistibly impelled</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">to do so. And her words were blessed to her patient and sanctified to</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">her own spirit.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Catherine had a powerful coadjutor in her good work. It was the sorrow</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">in Carolyn’s heart. And ah, who could sound the depth of that sorrow?</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Loving as passionately as she had loved! Sinning against that love as</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">cruelly as she had sinned! Punished for her sin as terribly as she was</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">punished! And now ruined and hideous in person, and wrecked and</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">despairing in mind, to whom could she cry in her sharp agony but to</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">God?—her Creator and Father!—Whose arm was strong enough to lift her</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">from that horrible pit but God’s—but God’s? And the All-Powerful, the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">All-Merciful, was helping her every day.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">The great strength, the great vitality of her sorrow, was the thought of</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Archer Clifton. Could she have hoped for a reconciliation with him,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">however distant, all else might have been borne. But with that death’s</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">head of hers, such joy might never be hoped—ought never to be wished.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">No, she was as the leper, set apart from human love—at least from</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">conjugal and maternal love—forever and forever! This was hard—this was</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">well nigh intolerable!</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">She would no more grace the saloon with her surpassing loveliness—the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">pride of her family—the ornament of their house. Her heart would no more</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">swell with exultation, when, on entering the drawing-room, in the full</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">glory of her peerless beauty, she would hear a murmur of admiration pass</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">through the company. No. If she should ever enter a saloon again, she</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">would make a tremendous sensation, truly—but it would be one of</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">astonishment, pity, and perhaps disgust. And that thought was dreadful,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">dreadful to the proud young belle! But oh! it was as nothing to the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">feeling that her household gods were broken and ruined forever—that her</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">hopes of domestic happiness were gone forever! For underneath all the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">pride and vanity and scorn of the young belle had been the woman’s</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">thought, the woman’s hope of the coming long, calm days of wife and</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">mother joy. Yea, as surely as under the burnished satin boddice had beat</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">the heart of flesh! But all these were over now; the proud, vain</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">aspirations of the belle, and the woman’s deeper, purer hopes! Both</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">crushed by one fell blow! All was lost in the world! Nothing was left</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">but Heaven!</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2"><span class="Apple-converted-space">                                </span>“If God would take</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2"><span class="Apple-converted-space">                    </span>A heart that earth had crushed.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Many are driven by the storms of life to the Heavenly Father’s bosom. It</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">is for this that the tempests of sorrow are sent, and the sooner that</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Divine sanctuary is sought, the better, for hard and harder will beat</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">the storm until its end is answered. And too often all is lost, or seems</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">lost, before we consent to save ourselves. With Carolyn, all the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">treasures of her youth were gone,—health and beauty, love and hope.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Something like this she breathed to Catherine, in a weak, despairing</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">mood,—for only in a miserably depressed state of mind and body would the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">proud girl deign to complain.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Dear lady, do not say so sadly that ‘all is lost—forever lost.’ Dear</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">lady, _nothing is ever lost_. It is impossible. The Lord, in His Divine</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Wisdom, may withdraw His gifts, but they are not lost—they have gone</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">into His keeping.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“I do not comprehend you! My poor good looks, such as they were, are</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">surely gone forever. Nothing can restore them! And oh, Catherine! you do</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">not know—you cannot understand all the blessings, the hope, and the joy</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">of my life fled forever! You are a child—you do not understand it!”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Perhaps I do not, lady, and perhaps I _do_! Seek all that you have lost</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">in God! He has withdrawn His gifts, your treasures, that He may draw you</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">to Himself! They are safe in His treasure house. If you have lost the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">beauty of the fair roseate complexion, He can endow you with a higher</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">beauty, emanating from the soul. If you have lost human love, He can</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">satisfy your soul with the richness and fullness of Divine love that</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">never faileth! And for your broken earthly hopes, He can give you the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Heavenly hope that never dieth.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Oh! but it is the lost earthly hope, personal beauty and human love,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">that were so dear to me! So dear to me!” exclaimed the poor girl,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">bursting into a passion of tears.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“And He can restore even those! ‘But seek ye _first_ the Kingdom of</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Heaven, and all these things shall be added to you.’”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Ah, child! _Nothing_ but a miracle could give me back dead happiness.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">And the days of miracles are over!”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“No! no! There is nothing in the Scripture to warrant that saying. The</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">days of miracles are _not_ passed. Until the days of human faith and</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Divine Omnipotence are past—the days of miracles are not passed.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Anything that _seems_ to me right that I should have, I will pray</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">God—that if it _be_ right, He will give it me—though it should appear to</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">my ignorance utterly impossible!” Then Catherine abruptly stopped,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">fearing that she had said too much. And she silently prayed for a faith</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">that should be as far removed from presumption, as from despair.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Carolyn convalesced very slowly. It was weeks before she left her bed.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">And then many more weeks before she left her room.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">It was a glorious day in Autumn, when she first walked out upon the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">lawn, supported between Catherine and her father. And as soon as she set</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">foot upon the green sward, some cattle that were browsing there—by some</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">caprice to which cattle are subject—started off as if seized by sudden</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">panic, and ran huddling together confusedly, and precipitating</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">themselves towards the outer gate. And so weak were the poor invalid’s</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">nerves, and so morbid her mind, that she burst into tears, and declared</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">that the very brutes fled from before her face, as from one less human</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">than themselves! Nor could any argument of Mr. Clifton’s or of</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Catherine’s, disabuse her mind of this absurd idea. She begged Catherine</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">to take her back to her chamber. And for many weeks no entreaties could</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">induce her to leave it.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Zuleime came freely to her sister now. She had her harp brought into her</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">room. And she soothed the recluse with music every day. And at last Kate</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Kavanagh, who had gradually merged from nurse into companion, added her</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">own rich, full-toned voice in accompaniment. The Misses Clifton were</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">both very much surprised to see this “gift of gracious nature” thrown</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">away upon a poor girl, with no hopes or prospects but manual labor for</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">her living. And Zuleime, who could be thoughtful and benevolent in the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">midst of anxiety and sorrow, proposed to give Catherine lessons on the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">harp. But this was soon stopped. Both Zuleime and Catherine perceived</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">that the music, far from soothing, seemed to irritate the invalid. And</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">for this reason, Carolyn had lost her voice. She could never sing again.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">And even in speaking, her tones were harsh and rough. The harp was</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">banished, and books were brought. And while Zuleime worked, and Carolyn</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">fondled a little King Charles, that had been bought for the childish</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">invalid, Kate read aloud to the sisters. And now it was that the world</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">of _written_ poetry broke upon the maiden’s delighted view. Before this,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">she had never read a line of poetry in her life, except hymns—for Mrs.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Clifton had judiciously suppressed all books of that nature. But now the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">treasures of Milton, Goldsmith, and Cowper, were opened to her ardent</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">mind! Oh, those days that followed the convalescence of Miss</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Clifton—those evenings after Carolyn had gone to rest, when she and</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Zuleime would go into the summer saloon and spend the hours in music or</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">poetry, or in talk as musical, and as poetic. Those evenings, spent with</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">a refined, warm-hearted girl like Zuleime—they were unfitting her for</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">her prospective hard life of coarse labor and coarser association. She</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">felt that it was so. And she determined to leave. She only waited until</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Mr. Clifton went to Richmond and brought back his wife. And then she</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">bade them all good-bye and returned home—not to the farm-house of</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Hardbargain, but to her brother Carl’s cabin.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">She needed to commune with herself, and be still. She wished to descend</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">into the unsounded abysses of her heart, and examine, though with awe,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">the mystery of iniquity that in some unguarded hour had germinated</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">there—this growing passion for a man betrothed to another. No matter if</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">the marriage was broken off for the present. They loved each other. And</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">_that_ was the true betrothal. As for herself, she would, with the grace</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">of God, turn out this dangerous bosom guest, so divinely fair as to seem</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">like an angel of light rather than the tempting demon that it was! And</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">to do this effectually, she must break every tie that held her to that</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">fair illusive life she had lately led. She must forsake every</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">association connected with her sin and folly. She loved Mrs.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Clifton—loved her first for herself alone, and then as the mother of—one</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">whose name she dared not now to breathe even to herself. She enjoyed the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">congenial society and occupations at White Cliffs and at Hardbargain.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">And now she was the most welcome visitor on the list of both families.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">But she must forego the privilege this gave her. More than all, she had</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">enjoyed her pleasant life at Hardbargain. The cheerful housekeeping</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">cares she had shared with its mistress—the conversations over the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">pleasant tea-table or the social work-stand—the books, the newspapers,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">and the evening music, and the society of the admirable Mrs.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Clifton—these formed the externals, the body of her happiness; but the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">interior, the soul of her joy, was that _there_ was the home of Archer</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Clifton—the place pervaded by his spirit! redolent of him! But all these</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">_must_ be abandoned! They might have affinity for her nature, but they</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">did not belong to her lot in life. And see what they had brought her to!</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Even to an insane passion for her benefactor! And now it was high time</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">she had come to her senses and self-recollection. She was a poor girl,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">of the humblest birth—born in poverty and destined to poverty. She must</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">leave off spending evenings with refined and accomplished young ladies</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">in elegant saloons, if she wished to do her duty in that station to</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">which God had called her. And she must give up the society of Archer</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Clifton’s mother, if she wished to forget him. And she must betake</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">herself to the coarse, hard, but dutiful life of her brother’s cabin.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Catherine went no more to White Cliffs or to Hardbargain. And when Mrs.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Clifton sent for her to come and spend a day, she returned a gentle</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">answer that she could not leave her grandfather.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>

<p class="p3"><span class="s2"><span class="Apple-converted-space">                            </span>THE BLACK SEAL.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2"><span class="Apple-converted-space">                </span>Her eyes unmoved, but full and wide,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2"><span class="Apple-converted-space">                </span>Not once had turned to either side—</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2"><span class="Apple-converted-space">                </span>Nor once did those sweet eyelids close,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2"><span class="Apple-converted-space">                </span>Or shade the glance on which they rose;</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2"><span class="Apple-converted-space">                </span>But round their orbs of darkest hue,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2"><span class="Apple-converted-space">                </span>The circling white dilated grew—</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2"><span class="Apple-converted-space">                </span>And there with glassy gaze she stood,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2"><span class="Apple-converted-space">                </span>As ice were in her curdled blood.—BYRON.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">The evening was chilly—just chilly enough to make the novelty of the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">first fire of the season a luxury. And so Zuleime had ordered a bright</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">little fire kindled in the parlor, and the tea-table set out there. And</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">she had changed her white muslin dress for a fine crimson poplin one,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">and began to think of the pleasant autumn evenings, when all the family</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">would gather around the hearth, with needle-work and books and social</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">chat. And, like a child, she was forgetting the threatening dangers that</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">lay before her, and those she loved—her father’s trouble, Major Cabell’s</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">expected arrival, Frank’s peril in distant warfare, the difficulties of</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">her own position—all were for awhile forgotten, in the dream of cheerful</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">fireside affection and comfort, as she moved about the room, closing</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">blinds, dropping curtains, and wheeling easy-chairs up near the fire,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">and thinking with what a fine smile of genial satisfaction her father</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">would come in and look around upon the change before he dropped himself</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">into that largest easy-chair. Mr. Clifton had ridden to the village, but</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">was expected back to tea. And there sat the tea-table, a little aside,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">to be clear of the chair, near the fire-place, and radiant with snowy</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">damask and shining silver.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Carolyn came in, pacing softly, slowly, and turning her eyes around the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">room with a look of languid approval, she sank into an arm-chair.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Zuleime went to her immediately, and relieved her of the large shawl she</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">had worn through the chilly passages, and closed her dressing-gown, and</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">settled the lace border of the delicate little cap, and placed the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">softest cushion under her feet, and then kissed her forehead, but did</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">not speak. Carolyn repaid her with a silent look of affection. Since the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">departure of Catherine, Carolyn had sunk into a sort of mute</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">despondency, in spite of all the care and affection of her sister, for</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">it was her moral nature that needed help, and the young Zuleime could</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">not</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2"><span class="Apple-converted-space">                     </span>“Minister to a mind diseased”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Mrs. Georgia Clifton entered, and silently glided to her seat.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Unconsciously, Georgia became a dark and terrible picture. She sat upon</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">a low ottoman, at the corner of the fire-place, her head supported by</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">her hand, and all her glittering ringlets falling like a glory down each</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">side of her darkly splendid face. And through that strong light and</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">shadow her form palpitated, her bosom heaved and fell, her moist lips</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">dropped apart, and her eyes gleamed with a set, steady fire, as though</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">some passionate trance wrapt and spell-bound her soul.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Zuleime was moving about the room, and giving directions to a servant,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">who had brought in cakes and preserves. Finally she sat down, and took</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">out her knitting—it was a pair of white lamb’s wool socks, for her</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">father—and knitted while she waited. She had not long to wait.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">The door swung open silently, and Mr. Clifton entered, with a newspaper</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">in his hand, but looking so shocked and troubled, that all, with one</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">accord, raised their eyes in silent inquiry.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Poor Frank! poor Frank!” exclaimed the old man, as if he was ready to</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">burst into a passion of tears.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“What!—what of Frank?” asked a faltering, gasping voice, which he could</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">not recognize as belonging to either of the three young women</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">present—yet answered, mechanically—</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Those bloody Redskins! Those ghastly, horrible Savages!” he cried,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">throwing himself into a chair.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“There—there has been some fighting! Is——Tell me!—tell me! You know what</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">I want to know. _Is Archer safe?_” exclaimed Carolyn, bending forward.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">While sallow and fierce, the eyes of Georgia gleamed the terror and</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">anxiety she dared not express!</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Archer is safe!” said Mr. Clifton.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">And the light of a sudden joy flitted across Georgia’s dark face,—and</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Carolyn sank back, with a look of grateful relief. And no one noticed</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Zuleime. And no one knew that she had spoken.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Yes! Archer is safe! Thank God! And a thousand times _thank God_, that</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Archer is safe! But Frank!—poor Frank! My God what a fate! Who shall</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">tell his mother?”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“For Heaven’s sake!—what has happened to Mr. Fairfax?” asked Georgia.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“There! There! Read for yourself,” replied the old man, getting up, and</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">handing her the paper. He did not mean that she should read aloud,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">perhaps—but he forgot—he was confused with trouble.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">And she took the paper, and read:—“FROM THE INDIAN FRONTIER; HORRIBLE</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">MASSACRE NEAR FORT PROTECTION.—Dispatches from our Western frontier</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">bring the most painful account of a horrible massacre of a part of our</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">troops by the Indians, in the vicinity of Fort Protection. On Monday,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">the 15th ultimo, a small reconnoitering party left the Fort, under the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">command of Lieutenant Fairfax. They had proceeded about a mile on their</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">way, when they fell into an ambuscade of Indians, and were cut to pieces</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">in the most shocking manner. The body of Lieutenant Fairfax, in</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">particular, was so horribly mutilated as to be scarcely recognizable.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">The full particulars of the massacre, given below, are copied from the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">‘National Sentinel.’”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Then followed a long account of the catastrophe, with every revolting</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">circumstance detailed with horrid distinctness. The old man heard and</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">groaned at intervals. Carolyn shuddered and wept by turns. And even</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Georgia’s voice broke down for pity and horror. But _she_—the wife—the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">widow—she—the fearfully bereaved—she sat and listened to all the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">murderous story. She heard all—all. How he had been set upon by six or</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">seven—how he had singly battled with them, when all his party were lying</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">dead around him—how then he tried to escape such fearful odds—how he was</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">felled, and dragged down from his horse—the young, warm beating heart</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">was cloven through—the fair hair torn from the bleeding skull—the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">fingers chopped off for the sake of the ring—Frank wore but one—a simple</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">gold ring, with a coral set, that she had taken from her slender fore</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">finger, and contrived to squeeze past the joint, and get it comfortably</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">upon his little finger. And they had cut it off in their haste to get</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">it. How real that trifle made the whole horror, that might else have</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">seemed like a nightmare! She sat and heard it all—all. And no motion, no</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">tear, no cry escaped her.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">At last, when the reading was over, and they were released from the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">spell of horror, old Mr. Clifton thought of Zuleime, and feared its</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">effect on her. He turned to look at her. At first he saw nothing amiss.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">She sat so naturally, though still, with her knitting in her hands, as</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">though only stopped for an instant, and her face turned in a listening</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">attitude toward Georgia, who had ceased to read.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“It is all over—there is no more to hear, Zuleime, my darling,” said the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">old man.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">But she did not move or speak. She seemed to look and listen intently.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Zuleime,” said her father gently.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">She remained perfectly still.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“_Zuleime!_” he exclaimed, in a louder tone. She did not hear.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“ZULEIME!!” he cried, a third time, going towards her, to seize her</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">shoulder.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">But he started back in affright. They were all gazing at her now.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“My God! she is DEAD!” ejaculated the father.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“She is MAD!” exclaimed Georgia.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">They gathered around her. She knew it not. She sat there as if frozen</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">into that attitude—her face white and hard—her lips bloodless and stiff,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">and her eyes still fixed towards the spot from which Georgia had been</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">reading, but beyond it—beyond it—into the far distance, as if fascinated</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">by some spectacle there of unutterable horror!</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Zuleime! what are you looking at? Speak to me, my child!” cried her</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">father, in great distress.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">He might as well have expected a statue to speak.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Carolyn took the knitting away, which, through all this, had dangled</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">between her stiff, unconscious fingers. Georgia rubbed her hands.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Carolyn bathed her face. The old man cried to her—all in vain! They</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">might as well have performed these offices for the dead.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">They lifted her up, and laid her on a sofa—her limbs hanging helplessly,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">like those of a dead or swooning girl. But she was neither dead nor</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">swooning. Wherever they moved her, her eyes were still fixed, in that</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">bright, burning, horrible stare, upon the distance, as though the vision</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">of the ghastly spectacle that had been conjured up before her</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">imagination, followed her wherever she was turned.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">They took her up stairs, undressed and put her to bed. All night long</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">she lay in the same state.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">In the morning there was no change, except that the muscles of the face</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">had fallen, the cheeks sunken, the chin dropped, and that concentrated,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">intense gaze into vacancy, was more burning bright than ever. It was as</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">though a burning soul was consuming the unconscious flesh to death. Or</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">as if a body were turning to dust and ashes with the spirit still</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">imprisoned in it.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“She is sinking, and must die, unless she can be moved to tears,” said</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">the doctor.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">But what should move her to tears? Was there anything on earth that she</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">could weep for now? Her old gray father had knelt, weeping, by her</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">bedside, and torn his silver hair in anguish, without causing a single</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">eyelash to quiver over that fixed, burning eye! What should make her</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">weep? Plaintive music? She could not be made to hear it! The very songs</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">that she and Frank had sung together? The sound was drowned in the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">groans from that scene of blood!</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Mrs. Clifton, of Hardbargain, had come over, but though she was a woman</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">of great skill and experience, all her efforts failed to rouse the girl</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">from that fearful trance, which seemed likely to end in death.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Send for Catherine! If any one in the world can do her good now, it</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">will be Catherine. There is, besides, a Free-Masonry between girls of</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">the same age, that makes them instinctively understand each other. If a</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">child were in a stupor, I should certainly send its favorite</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">playmate—another child—as the most likely being to rouse it,” said Mrs.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Clifton.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Ah! My Lord!—this is worse than any stupor! I wish to Heaven she would</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">fall into a stupor,” replied the father.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“I know it! For her mind is not dulled, but seems wrought up to the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">highest pitch, and intent upon some imaginary vision of horror. She must</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">be brought out of it. She must be subdued. Send for Catherine.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Mr. Clifton went himself in the gig, to bring the kind girl.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">When Catherine arrived, and while she stood by the side of the stricken,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">insensible girl, Mr. Clifton said to her—</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“You see, my dear child Zuleime seems to have been very much attached to</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">this poor young man. And the news of his horrid death was broken to her</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">suddenly, and it has just thrown her into this state! Look at her eyes!</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">What do you think they see—in imagination, I mean?”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“They see that scene of massacre—they see the death of her lover,” said</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Kate, looking piteously at her friend—(for Zuleime _was_ her friend)—and</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">brooding deeply over some idea.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“The doctor says she must die if she cannot be made to weep! Oh, Katey,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">my dear, _dear_ girl! If you can _only_ make her weep! I will give you—I</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">was going to say—I would give you half of all I have in the world! Come,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">try! That’s a good girl! You girls all know each other’s little</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">fool-secrets and love nonsenses. Come, try. Do you want to be left alone</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">with her?”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Kate shook her head in that quick way usual to her when strong feeling</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">kept her silent—but she added—</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Give me her keys.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">The old man seemed surprised, but looked about and discovered the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">required articles in her little work-basket, and handed them to Kate.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“I only want to search and see if I cannot find something that was</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">his—some little token or keepsake, you know.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">The old man took his station at the foot of the bed, while Kate pursued</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">her search. She knew what she was looking for, it was a curl of fair</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">hair. She had caught a glimpse of it once—when Zuleime had opened a box</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">in her drawer, and had immediately shut it again with a deep blush. And</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">now she knew whose hair it was; and that the sight of it would bring</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">tears to those burning eye-balls, and consciousness to that frenzied</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">brain. She found it. She could have wept herself as she raised it from</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">its little hiding place. She took it to the bedside—put her hand gently</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">over those glaring eyes to darken them, and break the spell if possible,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">and then lifting her hand off again, she held up the lock of hair by the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">end, letting it drop into a fair shining ringlet before the eyes of the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">girl, as she said—</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Zuleime, do you know whose hair this is?”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">The poor scathed eye-balls fixed upon it—softened—melted from their</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">searching glare—a change came over her face—she extended her hand, and</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">caught the tress as if fearing to lose it, and pressed it with both</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">hands to her heart. Then her bosom began to heave convulsively, as with</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">a great coming agony. Catherine caught her up, for she seemed about to</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">suffocate. It was only the coming of the flood of tears—yes, the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">_flood_, for she fell upon Catherine’s sustaining bosom, and sobbed and</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">wept—such a deluge of tears, that the girl’s dress was dripping wet, and</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">it grew a wonder where so much came from. And Catherine’s heart was</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">smitten, and she wept, too—wept till she grew so weak she could scarcely</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">sustain her burthen. And then old Mr. Clifton came around and relieved</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">her, taking Zuleime into his arms and laying her head against his</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">shoulder, saying—</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“There, cry! Cry on its father’s neck, as much as it wants to! It shall</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">cry its fill, poor thing! poor little heart-broken thing!”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">And she _did_, abundantly!—but pressed and kissed her father’s neck the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">while for his tender words. This melted down the old man’s heart so that</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">he said—</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“They shan’t plague you! None of them shall! Charley Cabell shan’t come</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">here to trouble you! _That_ he shan’t. _Come what will_, you shan’t be</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">forced to marry him! No, no, my darling—my poor little heart-broken</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">darling, you shan’t! I’ll see him in perdition first! And myself, too!</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">There, don’t stop! Cry it all out on father’s neck! Don’t stop! Catch</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">your breath and begin again! That’s right! That’s a good girl! Oh,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">she’ll cry a plenty this bout. Once I couldn’t bear to hear women cry!</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">It was because I did not know that if the grief was not cried out, it</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">would stay in the heart and burst it! I will never try to stop a woman</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">from crying again. Cry on, my poor little thing!” And so most tenderly,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">but half-childishly, the old man talked, and petted, and cooed over her.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Catherine slipped down stairs to prepare tea and toast.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">When she came back, she found Zuleime lying back upon the pillow</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">exhausted, but composed, and still pressing the little lock of hair.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Catherine set down the little waiter, and took a bowl and napkin and</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">washed her face with cologne and water, and then brought the cup of tea.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Zuleime shook her head mournfully.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Catherine stooped and whispered.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“For your father’s sake, dear. Look at him.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Zuleime raised her eyes to the old man’s grief-worn, anxious face, and</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">then extended her hand for the cup, and drank the tea.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">While Zuleime was resting in Catherine’s arms and drinking the tea, a</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">knock was heard at the door, and when Mr. Clifton opened it, a servant</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">appeared and told him that Major Cabell had arrived, and wished to speak</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">with him.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">And the old gentleman set his teeth, and immediately went below.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>

<p class="p3"><span class="s2"><span class="Apple-converted-space">                              </span>CHAPTER XVI.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2"><span class="Apple-converted-space">                       </span>MR. CLIFTON’S RESOLUTION.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2"><span class="Apple-converted-space">             </span>Full many a storm on this gray head has beat</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2"><span class="Apple-converted-space">             </span>And now on my high station do I stand,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2"><span class="Apple-converted-space">             </span>Like the tired watchman in rocked tower,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2"><span class="Apple-converted-space">             </span>Who looketh for the hour of his release.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2"><span class="Apple-converted-space">             </span>I’m sick of worldly broil, and fain would be</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2"><span class="Apple-converted-space">             </span>With those who strive no more.—JOANNA BAILLIE.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Well, old two pence ha’penny, how d’ y’ do? Family all well at last,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">eh?” said Major Cabell, advancing to meet Mr. Clifton, as he entered the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">parlor.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">The old gentleman extended his hand gravely, and welcomed his visitor to</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">White Cliffs. Then he rung the bell and ordered refreshments, but Major</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Cabell declined the latter and inquired after the ladies.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“My family are all in affliction! D—n it, Charley, you know it! Curse</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">that Indian war! My dear Carolyn scarcely recovered from the effects of</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">that loathsome pestilence, before here comes the news of that hideous</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">massacre of poor Fairfax and his men, and just overwhelms my little</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Zuleime!”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Zuleime? My dear little wife? I trust that nothing has been permitted</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">to afflict _her_?”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“The news of Fairfax’s horrible death shocked her into a sort of</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">appalled ecstacy, which lasted for twelve hours! And from which she was</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">only roused to break into such tears and sobs, as I never heard before,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">and hope never to hear again.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">The old man wished to prepare Major Cabell, gradually, for the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">announcement he intended to make of the marriage about to be broken off.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">He wished to touch his heart, to excite his sympathy, to awaken his</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">generosity. He even hoped—for people will have wild hopes in</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">extremity—that Major Cabell might anticipate his wish, and resign his</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">claims. He never was more mistaken in his life!</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Major Cabell listened in grave silence to his speech, and then in high</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">displeasure, exclaimed—</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“By my soul, sir! this is a very astonishing and most offensive thing,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">you tell me! Why should Zuleime grieve thus immoderately over the death</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">of this young officer. Will you explain that?”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Yes! I _might_ say—because he was her intimate companion in her own</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">home all the summer—and was soon after leaving it, so barbarously</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">slaughtered. That is quite a sufficient reason for the tender-hearted</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">child to grieve excessively. But I will not deceive you, Major Cabell.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">She loved this poor young man!”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Sir! Mr. Clifton! By Heaven, sir!”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“It cannot be helped, Charley! Hearts cannot be bound by parchment and</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">red tape! She loved this poor Frank Fairfax—and her heart is broken by</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">his sudden, dreadful loss. Her grief, poor thing, must have its way! She</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">shall not be troubled!”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“And pray, sir,” began Major Cabell, speaking with deliberate scorn—“how</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">long shall this faithless girl be permitted to weep over the memory of</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">that fellow, before she is required to give her hand to one who might</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">have claimed it as his right long ago?”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“_Charles Cabell_,” said the old man, speaking slowly and sadly, “is it</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">_possible_ that you _can_—that _any_ man could wish to marry a</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">broken-hearted girl, mourning over the grave of her freshly murdered</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">lover!”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“_Wish_ to marry her? Wish to marry Zuleime? Give her to me! Give me</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Zuleime! Only give her to me, and then see! She is my right! I claim her</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">by your promise—and I would take her _now_!”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“But you are certainly mad! You would be miserable with her!”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“_Should I?_ That is my affair! Only give her to me! Come! let me have</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">her to-day, or to-morrow, and I will take her home to Richmond with me,”</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">said Major Cabell vehemently, almost fiercely.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Old Mr. Clifton looked up at him in surprise, amounting almost to fear.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Have I ever described Major Cabell to you? He was a small man, with</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">clear cut, sharpened features, and pale face, surrounded by light brown</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">hair and whiskers, with very handsome dark brown eyes, but with a</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">certain latent ferocity in the eyes, and grimness about the thin, set</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">lips. Somehow or other he irresistibly reminded you of a</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">hyena—especially when he happened to laugh that thin, ungenial laugh.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">The old man looked at him in surprise, almost amounting to fear, and</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">then he said—</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“But she does not love you _now_! She cannot love you _yet_! She loves</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Frank in his shroud better than any one left alive!”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“I do not care! She must forget Frank, and love me! Women can be made to</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">feel or feign anything, by one who understands them.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“But her heart is breaking, I tell you!”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“It must stop breaking, and nerve itself to life.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“She is weeping her life away! She is a Niobe, I tell you! A living</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">fountain of tears!”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“She shall dry them and smile! See if I do not make her do it! Pooh! it</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">is baby love, all this! Do you think a girl of her age, can feel any</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">lasting love, or grief, or enduring passion of any sort at all? Pooh,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">pooh! I tell you if her lap-dog were killed, she would blubber and weep</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">as much over its death, as she does over this other puppy’s fate! But,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">once for all, Mr. Clifton, I tell you I do not intend to be put off, or</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">in any way annoyed by this girl’s grief and petulance. It is not well</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">for you, her, or myself, that it should be indulged. Give her to me at</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">once, according to your promise, and afterward I shall know how to deal</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">with her—far better than you seem to know.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“And you really wish to marry her in her present state, and take her</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">home with you?”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Yes! What objection? A wedding-party is not an indispensable accessory</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">to the ceremony. A bridal journey from here to Richmond would be a very</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">good substitute. Indeed, since the catastrophe of the last wedding-party</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">at Clifton, I think the bridal journey would be in the best taste.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Umph! And you would marry her so, and so take her away?”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Certainly.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“_Brute!_”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Sir?”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“BRUTE, I say! She would rather lie down with Frank in his bloody grave</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">than marry you! And _I_ would rather lay my child there—ALIVE—than give</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">her to you! There, it is said! Now, I hope you understand me?”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Major Cabell brought his two fierce brown eyes to bear upon Mr. Old</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Gentleman, and gazed as if he thought him bereft of his senses. Then he</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">spoke in a peculiarily thin, smooth, distinct voice—</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Do you mean what you say, sir?”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Yes I do! There!”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“And have you duly considered this, sir?”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Yes I have! There!”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“And you know and are prepared to meet the consequences?”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Yes! Do your worst! There!” said the old man, setting down his foot.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Major Cabell arose and walked up and down the floor in deep, perplexed</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">thought. To say that he was surprised at this sudden, unexpected</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">rebellion and daring on the part of Mr. Clifton would not be sufficient.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">He was just _astounded_, and could not surmise where the strength of the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">old man to oppose him, with his claims and his power, could come from!</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">He thought some external aid had been given! He never guessed that it</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">was the internal victory of conscience over cowardice.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Old Mr. Clifton also arose and stretched himself, expanding his chest,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">and taking a long, deep breath of intense relief and satisfaction,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">saying—</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Thank Heaven, I feel better. Feel more like a man than I have felt for</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">ten years. Now let the worst come, I can meet it!”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Major Cabell glanced sideways at him, and continued his thoughtful</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">pacing up and down the floor. He was possessed with a sort of ferocious</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">passion for Zuleime, a passion fanned to fury by opposition. He was not</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">one to bend his pride to sue. And yet he must have her! Soon, too!</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Old Mr. Clifton, now feeling and looking so much better and franker, and</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">remembering that Major Cabell was his guest as well as his relative,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">went up to him and held out his hand, saying, heartily—</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Charley, give me your hand! I do not know what you are going to do, but</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">I know that I am ready to meet what comes! In olden times mortal foes</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">shook hands before they entered upon a deadly combat. In our times the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">executioner and his victim exchange courtesies. And the humanity of it</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">is a touching comment upon the cruel necessities of our legal and social</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">code. Let us not be more ungracious adversaries than they. Give me your</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">hand. You are welcome to Clifton as long as you please to give us your</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">company. Sport is good now on the mountains, and you can amuse yourself</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">as you please.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Major Cabell paused in his walk, and placed his hand in the open palm of</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Mr. Clifton, saying—</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“I will take you at your word, sir! I will remain your guest for a few</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">days. I will hope that what you have said in regard to the marriage of</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">myself and your daughter, has been spoken in haste, and under the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">influence of anger. I trust that you will review your words. To-day you</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">speak from excitement—to-morrow I hope that judgment will dictate your</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">reply. You will remember that _I, too_, had something to complain of in</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">the fact that my affianced bride, or one that I considered such, should</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">have been so ill guided, or so illy guided herself, as to suffer her</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">affections to fall into this entanglement. But we will say no more about</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">it now, for I see Mrs. Clifton about to enter.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Georgia entered indeed, smiling.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Old Mr. Clifton seized the opportunity, and while Major Cabell was</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">paying his devoirs to the beauty, excused himself and left the room to</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">go and see how Zuleime was getting on, and to reassure her if necessary.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">As soon as he had left the room, Georgia drew Major Cabell off to a</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">distant sofa. And they sat down and entered upon a long, confidential</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">conversation. And when it was ended, they arose and separated with looks</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">of great satisfaction.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>

<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">A few days after the incidents recorded in the last chapter, Mrs.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Georgia Clifton entered Zuleime’s room. The poor girl was sitting in an</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">arm-chair near the window, idle, as was never her habit before, with her</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">hands lying languidly one over the other, and her eyes fixed upon</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">vacancy.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">The beauty went to her with her soft, winning way, and took her hand,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">and stole her arm over her shoulder, and said, tenderly—</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Zuleime, my love, do not sit here by this open window. Let me close it,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">and lead you to the sofa.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">There is nothing so quiet as despair, except death. There is nothing so</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">docile as despair often is. The beauty knew this by a satanic</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">inspiration, and calculated on it. Zuleime suffered herself to be led to</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">the sofa, which was wheeled up near the fire, as she would have</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">permitted herself to be led any where else. Georgia sat down by her</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">side, and passed her arm around her waist, and said—</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“My dear, I think you love your old father—do you not?”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">The poor girl raised her eyes mournfully to the lady’s face, as if she</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">did not understand.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“You love your father. You would not be willing to see him ruined in</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">fortune, and degraded in honor, would you?”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Still Zuleime kept her eyes fixed upon the speaker, with an expression</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">of hopeless imbecility.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“My dear child, let me be explicit. And try to understand me, Zuleime.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">It is of vital necessity to your father that you should. Will you listen</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">to me, Zuleime?”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Yes,” said the mourner, mechanically, without removing her gaze.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Well, then, you know your grandmother left you thirty thousand dollars?</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Well. Your father owes debts amounting to twenty-five thousand dollars,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">and is in danger of an execution or a prison, every day! You would</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">willingly give him your fortune to pay his debts with, we know. But,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">unfortunately, you cannot do it, because you are not of age. Neither can</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">your father appropriate it, of course. But if you were to marry, then</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">your husband would be in legal possession of that property, and could</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">dispose of it. Now, Major Cabell has bought up your father’s notes to</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">the amount of eighteen thousand dollars, using all his available funds,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">for the purpose of saving him from great distress, and in the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">expectation of marrying _you_, his daughter, and obtaining your little</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">fortune, which would replenish his coffers again. Now, Zuleime, Major</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Cabell is himself pressed for money. He would not, of course, come down</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">upon your father with an execution, but he will be compelled to sell</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">those notes again for whatever he can get for them. And then of course</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">the purchaser—some Jew or broker, would have no such scruples, but would</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">levy on all the personal property of his debtor, and most likely throw</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">him into prison, where he might languish for years—where he might die!</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Zuleime! you will not suffer this, if you can prevent it, will you?</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Speak to me, my love! I do not believe you understand me now! Why don’t</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">you answer me, Zuleime?”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“I—I don’t know. Yes I do. It was about a—about a—about somebody’s going</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">to prison. Was it the murderer? Alas, that will not bring him back.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Neither do I wish it. Not even _I_, who loved him so. I would not make</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">any body suffer, for the world. Oh, no.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">The beauty looked at the pale girl in deep perplexity a moment, and then</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">said—</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Zuleime, your _father_ is suffering! Let’s see if that will rouse you!”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“My father? Oh, no, he mustn’t. Tell him not to mind it. _I_ do not,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">much, now. I know he is at rest. And we shall be, soon. Tell him not to</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">mind it.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Zuleime! Awake! Arouse yourself! Your father is in _danger_, I tell</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">you!”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“In danger—in danger. Tell me about it.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Listen to me, then! Rouse your mind! and fix it upon what I am going to</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">tell you about your father’s peril.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">And the lady took her hands and looked into her eyes, watching their</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">expression, and bringing back her wandering ideas every time they showed</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">the least sign of flying, and rousing up her flagging intellect every</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">time it betrayed a disposition to sink—and so repeated the whole history</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">of the difficulty over again. But the distracted mind of the poor girl</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">was scarcely able to follow the pains-taking narrator through the facts</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">of the case. Passing her hand once or twice across her corrugated brow,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">she said—</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“What—what is it you say about father, and prisons, and Major Cabell?</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">I—I am afraid my memory isn’t as good as it used to be—please tell me</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">over again.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">The beauty, with a shrug of her shoulders, reiterated the story, placing</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">it in the fewest, simplest, and most direct words she could find. But</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">the stricken girl only looked sorely distressed and perplexed, and said,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">plaintively—</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Please forgive me, and tell me what it is that threatens father!”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“An execution—that will sweep off all the furniture from the house, and</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">all the negroes from the plantation; parting husbands and wives, and</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">parents and children, and brothers and sisters, among those poor,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">faithful creatures who love you so well. And for your father’s person, a</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">jail, where he may be for years, or until he dies.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Oh, pray don’t talk to me any more, my head is so wild, so wandering,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">_it wants to go back to something_,” said the poor thing, pressing her</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">temples, and strongly attracted to her one great wo.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“But your father!”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Yes! Oh, only tell me what you want me to do!”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“To marry Major Cabell, who will then have the disposal of your fortune,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">and can cover those notes and save your father.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“But—oh, yes! Now I remember. Father said there was no necessity! I</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">needn’t do it!” said the girl, pressing her finger hard upon the centre</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">of her forehead, and looking keen and old with the mental effort to</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">bring memory, attention and understanding to bear upon the subject.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Yes, yes, yes, yes,—he said I should weep in peace.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Yes, your poor old father loves you better than himself. And he said</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">that sooner than you should marry a man you did not love, he would die</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">in jail.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Did he? My dear good father! Oh, yes! now I think of it, it _was_</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">something like that, sure enough! Only my head is _so_ queer! He must</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">not go to jail—oh, never!”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“He _must_, unless you marry Major Cabell, and save him.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Well, I can marry Major Cabell—it don’t matter much—do you think it</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">does? Spirits up in Heaven know _nothing_ of what is going on on earth,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">or they know _all_ about it, and either is better than our deceptive</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">half-knowledge. If spirits know anything, they will know _our_ spirit.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Dear Frank will know—will know my spirit—nay, he does! I feel sure of it</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">at this moment. I will marry Major Cabell.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“But, Zuleime, if your father thinks you dislike Major Cabell, he will</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">not permit you to marry him.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“But I don’t dislike Major Cabell. I don’t dislike any one. I could not</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">now. It seems to me that I feel sorry for every one. I pity every one.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Every one has so much trouble, mamma! Mamma, I feel sorry for _you_. I</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">do not know how it is, but I _do_ feel _very_ sorry for you. Have you</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">any trouble?—You must have. Well, let God do as He pleases with you,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">because He knows best. Besides, it is only for a little while. And it</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">will all come right. Kiss me, mamma. I don’t think I loved you well</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">enough when you first came here a stranger. Never mind, I will try to</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">love you more in the future.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Georgia let the poor girl kiss her, and then arose and made an excuse to</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">go. Zuleime was weakening all her purposes. And she was obliged to</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">escape as people fly sometimes from a sermon.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Please send Kate to me, mamma,” said Zuleime.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">And very soon Catherine entered.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Dear Kate! please come and comb and curl my hair, and put on my crimson</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">dress, and make me decent and pretty to go down into the parlor to see</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Cousin Charles. It don’t matter, you know, Kate. Frank knows all about</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">it. He thinks so, _too_. Because he sees my heart is breaking all the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">faster for it, and that I shall the sooner be with him. You see, Kate,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">it is the heart-strings that hold the soul down to the body, and when</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">they snap—there! It is off—it is gone like a balloon,—when the cord is</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">cut it ascends to Heaven. _I_ feel light like that, sometimes, as if</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">only one little thread kept my soul down, and if it were to snap, I</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">could go.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Catherine looked at the mourner in deep trouble. Then she began to take</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">down her hair and comb its long sable tresses out, because she knew that</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">in itself to be a soothing process. And she stood and combed and brushed</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">it a long time, and then put it up, and bathed her face and hands.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Now, my crimson dress,” said Zuleime, quietly.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Catherine sat down by her side, and embracing her affectionately, said—</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Dear Zuleime, you are not quite well enough to go down into the parlor;</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">and, besides, Major Cabell is not here. He is gone with some gentlemen</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">upon the mountain to shoot birds.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Zuleime sat silent for a long time, enveloped by Catherine’s arms, and</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">leaning upon her shoulder. At last Kate whispered—</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Dear Zuleime, confide in me, and relieve your overburdened bosom. A</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">secret is so hard to keep alone in a sorrowful breast. Lay yours on my</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">heart, Zuleime, and it shall be safer there than my own life. Tell</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">me—what tie is it that binds you to Frank?”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Hush, oh, hush!”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Tell me, darling—you know it is not from curiosity I ask—it is that I</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">wish you to relieve your heart.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Hush! I promised him not to tell.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Death absolves you from that promise. A painful secret is very hard to</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">keep alone. _I_ know it, dearest, for _I_, too, have a secret. Now will</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">you trust me?”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Hush! hush! It was his last request—I must comply with it!” said the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">girl, with wild eyes.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Catherine knelt down before her, clasped her arms around her, and partly</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">to win her confidence, and partly to draw her mind from dwelling upon</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">the wo that was crazing her, said:—</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Zuleime, look at me. I am going to tell you my secret, that which it</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">will pain and humble my heart to tell!—that which it makes my cheek burn</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">now only to think of! Zuleime, I love a man who never sought, and who</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">would despise my love! And with whom it is forever and forever</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">impossible that I should marry. Yet I love him so much—so much, that my</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">heart is ready to burst with its powerless longing to do him some good!</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Zuleime, I would give him myself—(nay, never mind my cheek burning—I</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">will speak in spite of its protest)—or any dearest faculty or possession</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">of mine, if it only could increase his happiness. Zuleime, there is a</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">richness and fullness of joy in sacrificing one’s self for one we love</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">that passes all understanding.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“I know there is,” breathed the mourner, looking down in her face</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">seriously.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“That is the joy that I long for. And oh, believe me, I would sacrifice</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">myself or any possession or faculty I have, if it would only add to his</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">happiness or power. Eyesight is a precious treasure, is it not? If I</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">could give mine to him, and endow him with perfect vision down to deep</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">old age, I would consent to be dark forever. The power of speech is a</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">great gift—if by the loss of mine I could endow him with irresistible</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">eloquence, I would be dumb forever. _He_ thinks, Zuleime, that I have</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">talent. And sometimes _I_ think—but I don’t know, either! Anyhow, if by</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">yielding _all_ mine I could add a mite to the treasures of his</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">intellect, I would be willing to be a fool for life. In a word—if by</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">abdicating all my being, I could add to the largeness of his life, I</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">would glow with joy to do it.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Do not love him so! He will die if you do! _I know it!_ Frank died!”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“And yet, Zuleime, it is not that I wish to _lose_ my being, but to</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">_add_ to it. I do not know why it is, but I feel—not like an individual,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">independent existence, but like the complement of that other existence—a</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">half life—not full and complete of itself, waiting to be joined to the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">other half.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“He will love you. He will find you out,” said Zuleime. And her words,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">and tone, and look thrilled like a prophecy to the heart of Catherine,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">but she shook her head gravely, and answered—</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Never, Zuleime! It would be a sin even to hope it!——But, Zuleime, I</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">have laid my secret on your heart—_now_ will you confide in me?”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Oh, Kate! I would do it. I _wish_ to do it! But I promised him!”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Dear Zuleime, when he required that of you, he did not think what</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">might, what has happened. You must tell me, Zuleime. For if you have not</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">some one with whom you can talk freely, you—_I fear for you_. You cannot</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">bear your burden alone! Few human beings can! Tell me, darling?”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Oh, Kate! It was the last thing he asked me! I must comply with his</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">wish!”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Zuleime! I am about to cast away all reserve! I am about to tell you</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">the name of him I love so madly. It is Archer Clifton, your cousin—your</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">sister’s betrothed! There! I have thrown open the very sanctuary of my</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">heart to you. I have shown its secret sin and shame! Now, will you</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">confide in me!”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Dear Kate! Dearest Kate! My own secret’s without reserve, but not</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">another’s.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Catherine arose and took the seat by the mourner’s side. Well would it</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">have been for Zuleime in after life, if she could now have made a</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">confidant as well as friend of the excellent girl. But at least</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Catherine’s efforts had not been all in vain. The mind of the mourner</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">was a little more rational—her part in conversation not quite so</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">_distrait_. Presently Zuleime said—</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“It is getting towards evening. Cousin Charles will be back to supper.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Curl my hair, Kate! and put on my crimson dress, I _must_ go down and</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">spend the evening with them in the parlor! I must, Kate. It is for my</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">dear father’s sake! You do not know, Kate, else _you_ would also advise</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">it.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Catherine essayed to prevent her, but finding her quite determined,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">yielded the point, and assisted her to dress. When her toilet was</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">complete, she sat down again upon the sofa, and put her hand to her head</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">in troubled thought. Then at last she spoke, saying—</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Kate! I am afraid. It seems to me that—that my head has not been quite</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">right. And—and my speech has not been quite to the point. Kate, I want</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">you to tell me—can I trust myself to talk, do you think? or had I better</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">not try this evening? They might think me crazy if I should not talk</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">straight! But I am not! I am not crazy—only—Tell me how I am, and what I</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">had better do, dear Kate?”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Try to attend and be interested in what is going on, dearest, and talk</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">when occasion presents itself. And do not be afraid. Every one will</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">understand it is only nervousness, darling.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“You encourage me, Catherine,” said the poor girl, “and now just give me</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">your arm down stairs.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Kate complied with her request.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">The parlor was empty when they entered, and Zuleime had an opportunity</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">of settling herself in a large arm-chair, and composing herself, before</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">any one came in. Mr. Clifton, Major Cabell, and several other gentlemen</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">returned from the shooting excursion and entered the parlor together.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Mr. Clifton looked surprised and pleased to see Zuleime, “clothed and in</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">her right mind;” and Major Cabell seemed interested and curious. Zuleime</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">arose, and supported herself by resting one hand upon the arm of the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">chair, while she received the greetings of her father’s guests. And</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">thanks to the shadowing of the black lustrous curls, and the reflection</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">of the crimson dress, none could see the wanness of her face. Mrs.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Clifton and Miss Clifton entered soon after, and in the general</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">conversation that ensued, poor Zuleime escaped particular notice. Once</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Major Cabell contrived, without drawing attention upon himself, to find</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">his way to her side, and enter into conversation with her. And he was</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">surprised, perplexed, nonplussed at the gentleness and almost tenderness</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">of her manner. Before leaving her he asked—</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“When can I have an interview with you, Zuleime?”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Whenever you please, Cousin Charles,” she answered, gently.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">At parting, he pressed her hand, and to his surprise, the pressure was</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">softly returned. And he left her, thinking “the sex” more of a riddle</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">than he ever thought it before.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">The next day, about noon, Major Cabell and Zuleime met in the saloon,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">and had an interview of nearly an hour’s length.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">When Zuleime left him and came out, she met her father in the hall.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Taking his hands in hers, she looked up in his troubled face and said—</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Dear father! you remember many weeks ago, you asked me to fix the day</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">when I should be married to Cousin Charles?”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Never mind, never mind, my dear! That is all over now! You shall not be</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">troubled, my love!”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Dear father, I have just told Cousin Charles that I will give him my</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">hand on Tuesday fortnight,” said Zuleime, and pressing both the old</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">man’s hands to her lips, she turned and left him standing there in</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">speechless astonishment, while she went up stairs—and throwing herself</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">upon her knees by her bed, buried her face in the clothes, and</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">breathed—“It won’t be for long, Frank! Oh! Frank, you _know_ it won’t be</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">for long!”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>

<p class="p3"><span class="s2"><span class="Apple-converted-space">                             </span>CHAPTER XVIII.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2"><span class="Apple-converted-space">                           </span>THE YOUNG MOURNER.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2"><span class="Apple-converted-space">       </span>Mine after life? What is mine after life?</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2"><span class="Apple-converted-space">       </span>My day is closed. The gloom of night comes on,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2"><span class="Apple-converted-space">       </span>A hopeless darkness settles o’er my fate.—JOANNA BAILLIE.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">There is no state of mind so calm as that of hopelessness. And,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">therefore, there is none so often mistaken for resignation. Zuleime’s</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">cheeks were pale and hollow, her eyes heavy and sunken, and surrounded</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">by a dark, livid circle—and she had contracted an unconscious habit of</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">pressing her hand tightly over her heart, while a look of pain</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">corrugated her brow. Yet, withal, she moved through the house very</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">quietly—without a sigh or a tear—yea, even with a _smile_ for whom she</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">chanced to meet—a wan smile of tenderness, fellow-feeling. For the grief</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">that had come to her own young heart, had revealed to her the secret of</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">a general sorrow, and awakened a deep human sympathy. Yet perhaps it was</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">a morbid excess of this feeling that made her see, in every one she met,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">a fellow-sufferer. Her father misunderstood her serenity and her sweet</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">smile. And his wife led him into that misunderstanding.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“It is a merciful provision of Heaven, that young people of her tender</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">age, can feel no lasting grief. At first, over any misfortune they</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">lament excessively. But it is very soon forgotten,” said Georgia.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Ah, yes! Charley Cabell said something like the same thing, and,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">indeed, it seems to be true,” replied Mr. Clifton.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">We are easily persuaded to believe that which we wish to credit. And so</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">the old gentleman believed in the correctness of his wife’s judgment,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">and in the reality of his daughter’s peace.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Major Cabell was baffled and perplexed. “Jealousy is as cruel as the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">grave,” and so, also, is that base passion which often goes by the holy</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">name of Love. It had been under the influence of both of these that</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Charles Cabell had sworn to punish Zuleime severely for what he called</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">her faithlessness. But for the present, at least, he was completely</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">frustrated. There was nothing to complain of in her conduct to him. She</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">was very kind and gentle—not with the gentleness of meekness and</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">humility, but with that of a compassionate toleration—such as an angel</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">might feel in looking down upon a determined sinner—seeing his moral</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">insanity, and foreseeing his consequent wretchedness. Major Cabell had</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">frequently heard of mourners who could not bear to hear the names of</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">their beloved, lamented dead, spoken before them. And he thought to</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">torture her bosom by frequently reverting to “that horrible massacre,”</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">and “poor Frank.” But he could not add one pang to those she had already</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">endured. Her sorrow was too deep to be probed—to be _touched_ by a</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">superficial hand like his. She could bear to listen and reply when he</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">talked of her massacred love. For like a stationary panorama of the past</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">and the present, his life and death were ever before her mind. She could</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">converse, without new emotion, of him over whose fate, in its deepest,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">darkest horrors, she was ever brooding. If any mourners cannot brook to</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">hear the name of the lost mentioned in their presence, it is because</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">they are already blessed with long seasons of forgetfulness, and shrink</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">from the pain of remembrance. She had no such pang of sudden</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">recollection to dread. His memory—her sorrow—was ever present with her.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Catherine watched her with deep and painful interest. She sought an</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">opportunity, and once more had a serious conversation with her.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Zuleime, _don’t_ marry under present circumstances. If, as you say,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">your father is in the power of Major Cabell, it is bad. But if you marry</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">him to deliver your father, it will be worse, and will not eventuate in</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">any good. And two wrongs never make a right, Zuleime. Do no wrong,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">dearest, but trust in God for deliverance,” said Catherine, earnestly.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“It seems to me that I am doing right. It will please Cousin Charles,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">and save father. And as for myself—it _can’t_ matter much, you know,”</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">replied the despairing girl. And to this view of the case she adhered,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">with all the tenacity of a morbid resolution.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">A few days after this Catherine returned to her brother’s</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">cabin, wondering what new misfortune would—against her fixed</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">determination—throw her back among the Cliftons.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Major Cabell had written to Richmond for his mother and sisters to come</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">down and be present at his marriage. And one day, near the last of the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">week, the carriage of Mrs. Cabell rolled up to the door. Knowing nothing</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">whatsoever of Zuleime’s attachment to the young soldier, and consequent</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">deep grief at his fate, they were very much shocked to see her looking</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">so ill, but quietly ascribed it to fatigue and anxiety in nursing</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Carolyn. And Mrs. Cabell was emphatic in demonstrations of motherly</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">kindness, which the gentle girl acknowledged with grateful smiles, and</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">by such attentions as she had the power to bestow. The city ladies had</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">made a short stage that day, and were but little wearied, so that after</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">a little slumber, and the refreshment of the bath, and of tea, they felt</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">well enough to spend the evening in the parlor.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">The family were all around the evening fire, when Mrs. Cabell and her</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">daughters entered.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Major Cabell—who was as usual sitting by Zuleime, with his arm over the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">back of her chair in a property-holding sort of manner—arose, and</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">handing his mother to a seat, received from her hand a roll of papers.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“It is some new music, my son, for the dear girls. There are some</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">beautiful songs of Moore’s just published. Carolyn, love, I have</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">thirsted to hear your sweet voice again. Will you sing?”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Miss Clifton’s eyes filled with tears, and she turned away her head.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Zuleime stole to her aunt’s side, and while seeming to examine the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">music, whispered—</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Dear Aunt Cabell, Carolyn has entirely lost her voice!”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">The lady was very much shocked to hear it, and grieved at her own</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">unfortunate proposition, but durst not trust herself to reply, lest</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Carolyn should hear and understand the subject of their conversation.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Major Cabell, who was turning over the music, suddenly had his gaze</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">fixed by one particular piece. His eyes lighted up with a peculiar</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">satisfaction, and turning to Zuleime, he said—</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“My own, you can read music at sight. Can you not?”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Yes,” replied the girl.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“And you can sing and play at sight—can you not?”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Yes, if it is not too difficult.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Is this difficult?” he asked, holding a page out to her.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“No, that is very simple,” said Zuleime, looking entirely at the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">music—not at the words.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“It _is_ a ballad of Thomas Moore’s. I wish you to sing it for us. Will</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">you?”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Certainly.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Come, then,” he said, and took her hand, and led her to the piano. He</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">seated her, and laid the song before her, saying to himself, “If she can</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">sing _that_ through without emotion—ay, or _with_ emotion—if she can get</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">through it at all—she can do, or suffer anything! She is a heroine.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Zuleime was reading over the words, preparatory to singing them.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">And he was watching her intently. But she read through the song, turning</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">the leaves calmly, her pale cheek never changing its hue. Then she</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">restored the first page to its place before her, and began to play the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">prelude. The ladies and old Mr. Clifton drew near, and gathered around</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">her. Then her voice arose, soft, clear and plaintive, but unfaltering as</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">her cheek remained unchanging—though her father trembled for her as the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">words of the song fell on his ear. That song was “The Broken Heart,” by</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Thomas Moore. Zuleime sang—</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2"><span class="Apple-converted-space">         </span>She is far from the land where her young hero sleeps,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2"><span class="Apple-converted-space">           </span>And lovers around her are sighing,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2"><span class="Apple-converted-space">         </span>But coldly she turns from their gaze and weeps,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2"><span class="Apple-converted-space">           </span>For her heart in his grave is lying.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2"><span class="Apple-converted-space">         </span>She sings the wild songs of her dear native plains,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2"><span class="Apple-converted-space">           </span>Every note which he loved awaking:</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2"><span class="Apple-converted-space">         </span>Ah! little they think, who delight in her strains,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2"><span class="Apple-converted-space">           </span>How the heart of the minstrel is breaking.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Her voice faltered—she paused.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Come! no miserable, maudlin, mawkish self-pity, I beseech you!”</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">whispered Major Cabell, stooping to her ear.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Whether Mr. Clifton heard the cruel whisper, or whether he only saw her</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">slight agitation, is uncertain—but he drew near and stood by her side.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">She recovered, and continued—</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2"><span class="Apple-converted-space">          </span>He had lived for his love, for his country he died,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2"><span class="Apple-converted-space">            </span>They were all that to life—</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">She paused again—again essayed to sing—her voice quavering, sunk into</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">silence like the rudely-swept strings of the harpsichord—the grayness of</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">death crept over her countenance, and she fell back into the arms of her</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">father, who angrily exclaimed—</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Charles! you are a brute! a demon! to ask her to sing that song.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Zuleime! Zuleime, my darling! speak to me!”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">He sat down on the sofa, holding her in his arms. The ladies drew around</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">with fans, with cold water, with hartshorn. But she recovered very soon,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">and sat up—and declined going up stairs to bed—and thanked them all for</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">their care, gently begging them not to take so much trouble on her</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">account.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“This is all very strange, madam,” said Mrs. Cabell, aside to Mrs.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Clifton.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Zuleime is so nervous and sensitive ever since Carolyn’s illness, that</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">the news of that massacre, and the death of her old playmate and</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">companion, has quite overwhelmed her. I suppose this music awoke her</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">sensibilities,” said Georgia, composedly.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">If Mrs. Cabell had any suspicion of the truth, she was too well bred to</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">express it then and there. And the matter ended for the moment.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">But after this evening, Zuleime was never the same. Her fortitude seemed</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">entirely to have given away. Her calmness was utterly broken up. A</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">strange, wild terror and incertitude had come upon her.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">The next day, Mrs. Clifton, of Hardbargain, came over to call on the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">visitors. Nevertheless, in the course of the call, Major Cabell found</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">the opportunity he sought, of taking Zuleime to task for what he called</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">her miserable weakness.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“You are unfaithful—false at heart—you cherish the image of this young</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">man secretly, while you pretend to be true to me! Pah! Well! why don’t</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">you answer me? Have you anything to say?”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Cousin Charles, does not the grave sanctify any affection? Is it a</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">crime to remember a dead friend?”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“It is a miserable, druling weakness! a maudlin, mawkish, drivelling,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">puling piece of unfaithfulness to duty—and leads you into the exhibition</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">of such scenes as that of last night. Such whining, whimpering,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">contemptible _self-pity_! I protest you are the most false-hearted and</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">selfish woman I ever met with in my life. It is _your own_ griefs and</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">regrets and reverses, that occupy you all the time. And now! instead of</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">listening to me, and replying—you are falling away into thought again!</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Come! answer me, now! Was it not self-pity, that caused you to faint</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">during the singing of that _à propos_ song—which, by the way, I gave you</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">as an ordeal! Come! say! Wasn’t it self-pity?”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“_No, nor was it the song._ If I pitied myself, should I not pity _you_</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">as much? It is not such a happy fate, Cousin Charles, to marry a</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">grief-stricken girl like me, I know.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“_No!_ If I calculate upon your continued indulgence of that grief,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">which I do not! _No!_ Trust me on the part of my wife, there must and</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">shall be no such exhibitions of feeling as that of last night.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“I do not know why you wish to marry me!” she broke forth, with strange</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">wildness. “You do not love me! Perhaps you hate me, and marriage will</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">give you the same power to work out your hate as it would to act out</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">your love! Yes! I do suppose that is really the key to the riddle!”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Perhaps it is,” he answered, sarcastically.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“One thing I beg of you,” she said; “while we stay here—in my father’s</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">presence—try to use me kindly—to spare his feelings—he is an old man.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Reserve your vengeance until I am your wife, until we get to Richmond,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">when you will have full power, and ample time and space to work your</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">will.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">While she spoke so wildly, she pressed and rubbed her hand spasmodically</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">against her heart. And her pale brow was corrugated, and her intense</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">black eyes strained and sharpened as by mental and physical pain. She</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">gasped for breath, and began again.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“I do not know—I am sure—I cannot tell—whether, after all, we will ever</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">mar—”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">What she was about to say was cut short by the entrance of Mrs. Clifton,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">of Hardbargain, who came in, with her shawl and bonnet on, to take leave</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">of Zuleime and Major Cabell, and invite them to join the rest of the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">family in coming to dine and spend the evening at Hardbargain the next</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">day. Major Cabell accepted the invitation for himself and Zuleime, and</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">the lady took her departure.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">The next day was Saturday. The family set out on their visit at an early</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">hour of the day, as is the social custom of country neighbors. Old Mr.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Clifton, his wife, and his eldest daughter, rode in his carry-all. Mrs.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Cabell and her three daughters went in that lady’s carriage. Zuleime</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">rode on horseback, attended by Major Cabell.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">It was a glorious Indian summer day, when the splendor of the autumnal</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">sunlight would be too dazzling, but for the soft, warm mist spread</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">veil-like over it. At another time, Zuleime, true worshiper of nature,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">might have drawn deep draughts of pleasure from the beauty of the scene.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">But now the gorgeous magnificence of the forests, in their many colored</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">foliage—the misty mountain steeps softening the glory—the fine</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">transparent neutral tint of the heavens leading the eye and mind up</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">through infinite heights of ether—the glowing clouds reposing along the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">horizon—all were lost upon her.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">An hour’s ride by the carriage road brought the party to Hardbargain.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Mrs. Clifton received them with her usual quiet cordiality. There was</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">something very composing in that calm, kind, self-possessed woman’s</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">manner. There was something very sedative also in the air of her home.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">In her company and in her house the restless became quiet, the anxious</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">easy, the desponding cheerful, even the despairing mourners over some</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">great heart-wreck, grew languidly aware of how much good was left them</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">in the comforts of daily domestic life, and the amenities of social</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">intercourse.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">She was strikingly like her son. One was inclined to wonder how they—so</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">nearly identical in features and complexion—should differ so widely in</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">many points of character and sentiment, and had to remember that all in</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">which he did not resemble her was inherited from the Cliftons. Kate felt</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">the likeness keenly. And when the lady turned those quiet, brilliant</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">eyes upon her, her heart thrilled to the glance with strange pain and</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">pleasure. And when once or twice—for the lady was never very</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">demonstrative in her affection—she had quietly drawn the maiden to her</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">bosom—it was such a heart-feeding comfort, that Kate felt there would be</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">no possibility of forgetting Archer Clifton, while thrown into daily</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">intercourse with his mother. Once when Mrs. Clifton had looked tenderly</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">into her eyes, and drawn and pressed her closely against her breast, the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">girl, lost for an instant, had thrown her arms around the lady, and</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">buried her face in her bosom. And for some time after that, terrified at</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">her own impulse, she had been as shy of the mother, as she could have</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">been of the son. Kate had kept away from Hardbargain for many weeks, but</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">to-day, when the party from White Cliffs had arrived, Mrs. Clifton sent</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">for her, with the message that her friend Zuleime had come. That was no</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">sufficient lure to the resolute girl, however, who had once for all</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">determined that nothing but the absolute necessities of others should</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">draw her again into the dangerous association of the Cliftons. She</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">returned thanks to the lady, declining the visit. Mrs. Clifton was</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">disappointed in missing the society of her young favorite for that day.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Yet the time passed very pleasantly notwithstanding. There is scarcely</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">any such thing as a stiff dinner party in the country. And such a thing</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">was impossible at Hardbargain. The ladies had all brought their “parlor</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">work”—fine netting, knotting, knitting, or sewing—and they worked and</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">conversed in a quiet, pleasant way, while the gentlemen mingled in their</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">conversation, or talked with each other upon the two reigning subjects</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">of country discussion—agriculture and politics—or sauntered out upon the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">lawn to enjoy the fine autumnal weather until dinner. After which, the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">ladies in the cozy parlor lounged a little more lazily, and grew a great</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">deal more kindly in their interchange of thought and sentiment, and the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">gentlemen enjoyed a promenade on the piazza, and the stolen luxury of</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">their cigars.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">After an early tea the party took leave. They returned in the same</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">manner in which they had come. Zuleime on horseback, escorted by Major</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Cabell; the others in carriages. Even the soothing influence of Mrs.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Clifton’s home and society had almost failed to quiet the miserable</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">girl. Her manner, all day long, had been erratic in the extreme—now</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">depressed into gloom—sunken nearly to the depth of stupidity—now full of</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“starts and flows” as the crime-burthened Macbeth. As she rode home, in</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">perfect silence, the evil eye of her companion watched her stealthily.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Her cheek was pale and hollow, and her eye sunken and heavy. Yet</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">sometimes her eyes would lighten as with sudden terror, like those of a</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">startled hare, and her cheek would flush and fade. The road was broad,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">yet shadowy, from the meeting of the branches of the huge trees</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">overhead. And so soon as the sun went down it became too dusky to permit</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">him to see the flickering and sinking of the fire in her eye and cheek,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">but he watched her closely, nevertheless. Suddenly he saw her sway to</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">and fro in the saddle, like a reed blown by the wind. Then, ere he could</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">spring to her aid, the reins dropped from her hands, and she fell from</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">the horse, her foot catching in the stirrup. The well-trained palfrey</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">stopped, and stood without so much as lifting a hoof. With a deep curse,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Major Cabell threw himself from his steed, and raised her, disengaging</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">her foot from the stirrup. He sat down on a bank, with her on his knees,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">and took off her hat, and began to feel her head, neck and arms, for</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">injuries. It seemed impossible to tell whether, or how she was hurt. The</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">carriages were some yards behind, and concealed by a turn of the road.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">He dipped his hand in a run, at the foot of the bank, and sprinkled her</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">face; and before the carriages arrived, she had opened her eyes, and sat</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">up. She said that she was not hurt—that it was only a fainting spell,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">such as she had had at the piano. But her voice was very weak, and her</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">frame trembling, and her general manner frightened. She placed her hand</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">against Major Cabell’s chest, partly to assist herself in rising, partly</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">to push him away, and stood alone upon her feet, until her father’s</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">carriage drew up. Then she said she was tired, and wished to get in.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Old Mr. Clifton sent a glance of impotent rage at Major Cabell, as he</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">lifted his child in—placing her in the vacant fourth seat—the other</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">three being occupied by his wife, eldest daughter, and himself.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Zuleime sat next to her sister, and opposite Georgia; and the last</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">mentioned lady studied her _vis-a-vis_, with as much interest, and with</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">far more curiosity and comprehension, than Major Cabell had exercised.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">The girl sat perfectly still, and quite lost to all around her. But</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Georgia saw that it was the fearful stillness of self-restrained frenzy.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">They reached home at last. Georgia was handed out first, she waited for</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Zuleime, who followed. She wished to draw the girl’s arm within her own.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">But Zuleime, turning on her a dilated, strained, fiery gaze, fled past</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">her into the house. And then the lady saw, with a shudder, that it was</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">indeed the fires of incipient madness that kindled the lambent flame in</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">the girl’s eyes!</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">When they were all assembled in the parlor, around the evening fire,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">with books, and music, and light needle-work—</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Where is Zuleime?” asked her father.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“She has retired to her room, very much fatigued,” replied his wife, and</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">the subject dropped.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">The next morning, when the family gathered around the breakfast-table,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">the youngest daughter was still missing.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Where is Zuleime? Why doesn’t Zuleime come? Carolyn, have you seen your</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">sister this morning? How is she?” asked old Mr. Clifton.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Carolyn replied that she had not seen her since the preceding evening.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Send some one, then, to her chamber, to see how she is, and whether she</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">will join us at breakfast, or have anything sent up to her room.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Or—stay! Carolyn, don’t send—go yourself, my love, to your sister, it</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">will be only kind.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Carolyn left the table, and went up stairs, and after an absence of</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">fifteen or twenty minutes, returned, and announced, with a pale cheek,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">that Zuleime’s chamber had not been occupied during the night—that she</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">herself was no where to be found in the house—and that no one of the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">servants had seen her since the evening before!</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">A dreadful suspicion instantly seized upon all who remembered her wild</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">and moody looks and manners of the preceding few days; and they</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">simultaneously arose from the table, and with looks of alarm, dispersed</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">in various directions, in quest of the missing girl.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">The house, kitchen, out-buildings, negro quarters, garden, vineyard,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">orchard, the plantation and the woods were successively and vainly</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">searched.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Messengers were dispatched to Hardbargain and to the neighboring</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">plantations, with inquiries that proved fruitless.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Old Mr. Clifton ran up and down the house and grounds like one</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">distracted.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">At last, near night, traces were discovered of the lost one. Upon the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">edge of the stream, where the banks were soft and deep, small</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">foot-prints were seen—and half-way down the bank her little slipper was</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">found, with its toe deep in the mud, and the heel sticking up, as if</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">lost there in the downward run of its owner—and from the branch of a</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">sapling near, a shred of her crimson dress fluttered, as if caught and</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">torn off in the same swift descent.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Old Mr. Clifton walked down there, to see the spot; but he was _carried_</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">back.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">And before the next sun arose, Mrs. Georgia Clifton had her heart’s</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">first desire.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">She was a widow.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>

<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">A retrospect of several hours is necessary here. You will remember that</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">during the drive home from Hardbargain, Mrs. Georgia Clifton had watched</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Zuleime with much interest and curiosity, and with more perspicuity.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">When the unfortunate girl had sprung from the carriage, and fled up the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">steps into the house, Mrs. Clifton had followed her. Instead of going up</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">into her chamber, she had passed directly through the hall, and gone out</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">at the back door—Georgia having kept near her. There was the kitchen</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">garden at the back of the house, and then the vineyard, and then the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">orchard—through all these she successively passed, with the same wild,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">hurried gait, and entered the forest beyond, and descended into the deep</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">glen, through which the mountain-stream roared. It was very difficult to</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">follow the reckless steps of the fugitive down this rough declivity, and</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">while cautiously descending, with the aid of projecting fragments of</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">rock and smaller branches of trees and bushes, Georgia lost sight of the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">girl. When she reached the bottom of the gorge, through which the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">torrent raged and raved, Zuleime was no where to be seen.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">The night was very dark, and though a few large, brilliant stars were to</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">be seen directly over head, yet low from the horizon, heavy, black</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">masses of clouds were slowly rolling up. And the wind moaned and died</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">away at intervals—prophetic of the winter’s storm. The single, large</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">stars overhead were reflected in the stream—not clearly and calmly, but</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">plunging and leaping with the wild water. The banks each side lay</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">shrouded in gloom and mystery, rocks and trees indistinctly blended</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">together in dark and sombre hues. The everlasting mountains stood</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">around, vast, vague, and awful. The seven white peaks gleamed up in the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">back ground, like the ghostly genii of the scene. A shiver of</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">superstitious fear shook the frame of Georgia, and she had turned to</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">retrace her steps home, when a sound between a moan and a suffocating</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">sob arrested her purpose. She crept towards the spot whence the sound</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">proceeded, and there, half hidden in the deep gloom of overhanging</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">willows, she dimly discerned the figure of the unhappy girl, bending</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">over the stream, and gazing intently upon the water, where the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">reflection of the stars leaped and plunged with the waves. As if</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">communing with herself, she murmured—“There is peace there! There is</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">peace there!” Then her form bent lower, her gaze grew more earnest and</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">intense, as though body, soul and spirit were irresistibly fascinated,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">drawn down by the glamour of the water! And—“There is peace, deep peace</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">there,” she muttered! How stormy must have been the soul that saw deep</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">peace in the raging torrent! Her eyes shone in the dusk with a bright,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">phosphoric light, and still pouring their splendor upon the dark, wild</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">water, she murmured—“Peace! deep peace.” Suddenly up flew her arms, and</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">she sprang forward.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">The ready hand of Georgia caught her shoulder and pulled her back,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">exclaiming—</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Mad girl! What are you about to do?”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Zuleime sprang around with her eyes all wide and ablaze, like one</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">suddenly waking up from a terrible dream, and not yet quite brought to</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">consciousness. Georgia drew her away from the dangerous proximity of the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">torrent. Zuleime threw her hands to her head with sudden recollection</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">and intensity of consciousness, and sunk down at the feet of the lady,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">clasping her knees, and exclaiming—</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Oh! you don’t know what you’ve done! Why did you pluck me back! There</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">was peace there! The only peace left for me!”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“You are frantic, miserable girl! _What_ is the meaning of this</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">madness?” asked Georgia, in a stern, curt tone. Convulsive sobs, shaking</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">as with a tempest the form of the girl, alone answered her.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“_What_ will your father—what will your intended husband think of this?</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Say! Speak! What do you suppose Major Cabell—”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Oh! _do not_ speak of him!” gasped the girl.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Will you tell me what you mean by this conduct?” sneered Georgia.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Mamma—” commenced Zuleime but her voice broke down.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Zuleime! come get up and come home!”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Oh, no, no, no! _Not_ home! _Never_ home again!”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Once more, what am I to think of this frantic behaviour.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Mamma!”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Don’t call me mamma, if you please! It may not be pleasant or politic,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">to acknowledge that tender relationship. But explain yourself, lest I</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">bring you to those who will demand the explanation with less</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">forbearance!”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Mercy! mercy! I will tell you anything! everything! Only do not kill my</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">father with the story!”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Speak, then!”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Lady—”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Well!”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">But some feeling stronger than fear, gripped her heart and stopped her</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">speech.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Zuleime! How long will you try my patience?”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Madam—”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Another hesitation.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“_What_, then?”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“I have been—a wife! I am—a widow! I am fated to be—”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Well,” asked Georgia, in a deep-drawn breath between her teeth, “you</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">are fated to be—”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“_A mother!_” breathed the girl, in a dying voice, covering her face</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">with both hands, and sinking lower on the ground.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">There was a long, deep pause, filled up with the roar of the torrent and</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">the moan of the rising wind. Suddenly up sprang Zuleime, with fire in</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">her eyes, and made a dash towards the water. The swift arm of Georgia</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">caught and dragged her back. No word was spoken yet. The impulse of</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">frenzy passed off, and Zuleime sunk into her old posture.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Get up,” at last said Georgia, half-shaking, half-putting the girl upon</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">her feet. “Get up and come with me.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">And she drew her to a fragment of rock, at a safer distance, pushed her</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">down on the seat, and dropped herself by her side.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Now, tell me of this,” she commanded, in a hard, curt tone. “You were</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">married?”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Yes, yes!”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Who was your husband?”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Ah, you know! You _must_ know! He who died in yonder field of blood,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">under the tomahawk of the Shoshonowa—I am very wretched!”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Stay!—is this true—about the marriage, I mean?”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“True as God’s Word!”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Certainly the marriage was not legal without your father’s consent, and</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">would have been annulled by him. But now he will permit his consent to</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">be supposed. Let’s see! the widow of an army officer entitled to his</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">half-pay, perhaps; I do not know—perhaps to a pension, too, as he died</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">in the field of battle. Zuleime, upon the whole, I think that you were</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">rash to attempt suicide. Your position and prospects are not so bad. If</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Major Cabell is anxious to possess you, now that he supposes you to be a</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">maudlin, love-sick girl, grieving yourself to death over the grave of</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">your lover, he will be quite as willing to marry you a year hence, when</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">he knows you to be the widow of Captain Fairfax—for _that_, I</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">understand, was his rank when he fell. Come, girl, live! Acknowledge</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">your marriage, like a truthful woman! Bring your child into God’s world</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">like a Christian woman! And after a sufficient time has elapsed, marry</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Major Cabell, like a sensible woman! For I do assure you, that the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">gallant Major is sufficiently enamored of your young beauty to wait that</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">length of time, if compelled to do so.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Ah, yes! I think he is enamored of me as the Shoshonowa was of poor</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Frank’s hair!” bitterly said the girl.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“This marriage must be announced at once! Who performed the ceremony?”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Old Mr. Saunders, the Baptist preacher.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“What! He who was found dead in his bed.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Yes, yes, it was he!”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Pity for your sake that he is dead! But, you doubtless had some</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">confidant, some witness—Kate Kavanagh, perhaps, or some one else? Say!</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">speak! There was some witness to your marriage, who can be produced to</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">prove it?”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“No! There was none! It was _so_ sudden!”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“None!—no proof of your marriage? Yet stop—stay!—there is a chance yet,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">I believe; I do not know. You were married with a license, of course?”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Yes, yes!”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“The county clerk who issued it will probably remember the occurrence.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">That will be something in your favor, though, alas! only imperfect,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">circumstantial evidence; for the mere taking out of a license is no</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">conclusive proof of a marriage.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Ah, great or small, as proof it is of no avail. The license was</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">procured _blank_, for Carolyn and Archer, because he had forgotten her</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">full name, and it was afterwards filled out with our names.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“No matter. You were married with it. And now I remember a saving thing!</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">The clergyman who married you of course affixed his certificate of</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">marriage to the license, and gave it to you. Where is it? All depends</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">now upon that. Where is it?”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“I do not know! I never saw it! If the parson gave one, probably Frank</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">took charge of it!”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Again a pause fell between them, and the noises of the wind and waters</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">arose in gloomy concert. At last Georgia spoke—</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Miserable girl! And so you have no proof whatever of this _asserted_</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">marriage?”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“None! none! But oh, what does that matter, after all? God knows that we</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">loved, and _were_ married, as He knows that we will soon be reunited!”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Wretched girl! who will credit the story?”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“No one in the world, perhaps! But, ah! what odds? Could the proving of</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">my marriage bring _him_ back to life, or give my father happiness?”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Most wretched girl! You seem quite lost to the shame you have brought</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">upon yourself! the dishonor you have brought upon your family!”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Ah, go on! You cannot say anything to me so bitter as my heart is</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">saying all the time!”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Your father! Your old, gray-haired father! to bring him to shame in his</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">old age! Can he survive the knowledge of your fall?”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“I know he cannot! I know it! Oh, oh!”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Carolyn, too! To destroy all her prospects in life. Who will ever wed</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">the sister of a supposed—”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Ah, spare me that! Why did you pluck me back! the river would have</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">covered all!”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Because I did not know or dream your folly! Zuleime, your father, who</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">could bear your death, could never survive your disgrace!”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Oh, God, I feel it!”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Zuleime—_you must die_!”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">A pause, when but for the roar of the torrent, and the howl of the wind,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">their very hearts might have been heard slowly beating.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Zuleime, you must not live to bring shame upon us! You must die!”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Ah! Why did you hinder me when it would not have been a crime?”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“What mean you?”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“I was mad then! I knew not what I did! God would not have charged me</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">with my death! I am sane now!—sane, though most wretched!”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Zuleime, you must die!—not in reality, but in appearance. It must be</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">believed that you are dead—dead by your own act, as you intended. And I</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">will provide for your escape and your future support.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Alas! lady, what is it you advise me to do? Deceive my poor father, so</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">cruelly, and never, never undeceive him again? And never, never see him</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">again?”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Lost girl! if I had not saved you an hour ago, would you have been</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">alive to ask the question?”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Ah, no! But, oh, my father! Who will comfort him?”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Who would have comforted him had you effected your purpose this hour?</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">What would comfort him for your degradation? Foolish girl, that will</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">console him for your supposed death, which never could console him for</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">your fall—_time_. Besides, if you are supposed to be dead, it will not</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">only save us all from shame, but your father will be your heir, and can</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">appropriate that thirty thousand dollars to the payment of his debts.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Zuleime, it seems to me you owe us all this sacrifice.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“I—I am very weak and miserable. I—I scarcely know right from wrong! Do</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">what you please with me, only console my father!”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“And at any rate, girl, this plan is far better than the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">self-destruction you meditated awhile ago. By this plan you will be able</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">to save your child.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Ah! to what end? To be as miserable as its mother?”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Zuleime! time presses. To-night you must journey to L——, and take the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">stage thence to Richmond. I have a negro here on whose secrecy I can</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">depend; he shall take two horses from the stable and convey you to L——</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">in time to meet the Richmond stage. I will give you a letter that you</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">must deliver to its address as soon as you reach the city. Get up now</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">and come with me,” said Georgia, taking her hand to assist her in</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">rising.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">The unhappy girl mechanically yielded herself to the guidance of “the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">dark ladie,” and they ascended the glen.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Retracing their steps through forest, field, orchard, vineyard and</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">garden, they reached the house, and entered by the back door. The hall</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">was deserted; the family being at that hour gathered around their parlor</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">fire, and the servants being at supper.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Zuleime, go quietly up into your chamber and get ready, while I go down</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">and find the man I spoke of,” said Georgia.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Zuleime mechanically obeyed——. The next hour, while her father and</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">sister and friends were enjoying their happy evening re-union in the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">warm, bright parlor, the wretched Zuleime, through the dark night, and</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">the howling wind, commenced her journey. Of what followed the discovery</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">of her loss, you are already possessed.</span></p>

<p class="p3"><span class="s2"><span class="Apple-converted-space">                              </span>CHAPTER XX.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2"><span class="Apple-converted-space">                            </span>A DOMESTIC SCENE</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2"><span class="Apple-converted-space">                     </span>A light, commodious chamber,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2"><span class="Apple-converted-space">               </span>Looking out to the hills, where the shine</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2"><span class="Apple-converted-space">               </span>Of the great sun may enter.—MARY HOWITT.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Nearly twelve months have passed since the death of Mr. Clifton. It is</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">October, the most glorious month in the year, when the gorgeous beauty</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">of nature more than satisfies—when it enraptures the soul.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">I shall introduce you into a chamber, whose three large windows look out</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">upon the scene of glorious magnificence, only to be found when</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">mountains, vales and forests wear their gorgeous autumn livery. It is a</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">very large apartment, so long and lofty, that the great four-post</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">bedstead, standing with its head against the upper end, is not in the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">way. At the lower end of the room, there is an old-fashioned fire-place,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">where an oak fire is burning. The floor is covered with an ingrain</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">carpet, of warm, rich hues. The bedstead, lounge and cushioned chairs</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">are clothed with dark, bright chintz. The windows are curtained with</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">orange-colored damask, which give a mellow, autumnal tone to the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">atmosphere of the room. The curtains are festooned back, to admit the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">sunshine, and the glorious view without.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">The lounge is drawn up to the left of the fire-place, and Carolyn</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Clifton, in deep mourning, reclines upon it. She is very much changed</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">since we saw her last. There is scarcely a trace of her disease</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">left—only a few pits scattered thinly over the lower part of the chin</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">and throat. But she is very, very fragile, and her thin, white face is</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">almost spectral, in contrast with her black dress. Her fair hair has</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">grown out richer, sunnier in hue than before. It is just long enough to</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">turn, in natural, smooth ringlets, that reach to her throat. And she</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">wears it so. And those bright curls soften and shade the pearly</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">whiteness of her cheek. The expression of her countenance has changed</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">also. It wears a subdued, almost patient air of suffering. She is</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">beautiful, although now that the roundness and bloom of her cheek are</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">gone, she does not think so. She is beautiful, as she lies there</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">contemplating, with remorseful tenderness, a miniature that she has</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">drawn from her bosom.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">In the cushion chair, on the right of the fire-place, sits Catherine</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Kavanagh. She has also changed within the year. Her form is fuller,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">rounder, more womanly. Her grave, almost stern features, have softened</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">into gentleness. Her voice is softer and deeper. Its tones indeed are</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">very beautiful, and modulated with every shade of feeling. She wears her</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">hair in the same old style, parted over the forehead, rippling down in</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">dark, bright wavelets around her cheeks, and carried behind, and woven</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">with the back hair into a large plait, and then rolled round and round</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">into a succession of rings—a rich, dark, burnished mass of hair—</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2"><span class="Apple-converted-space">                </span>“Golden where the sunlight played,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2"><span class="Apple-converted-space">                </span>But where the tendrils sought the shade,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2"><span class="Apple-converted-space">                </span>Dark, but very beautiful.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Her dress of dark brown stuff, with the little white throat-ruffle, and</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">the black silk apron, is not very becoming to her. But she thinks too</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">little of her personal appearance, to care for any quality in her</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">clothing beyond neatness and comfort. She is knitting very leisurely,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">stopping occasionally to measure the stocking she is engaged upon with</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">the finished one which lies upon her lap. Kate is silent and thoughtful.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">All her life, up to this date, has been passed in the ministry to</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">sorrow—yes, to all sorts of sorrow—to the suffering arising from vice—to</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">the despair caused by evil passions—to common illness—to pestilence</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">forsaken of all but her—to death! Yes! But little turned of sixteen</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">years of age, and to all these forms of human misery had she been—not a</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">ministering angel, but a ministering child and woman—that ministry of</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">sorrow had filled up all her years, from early childhood, to this hour.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Now her days were passed in soothing and cheering the solitude and</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">depression of her invalid companion. And Kate was grave and thoughtful,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">because she was tempted to think that life was made up of nothing else</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">but trouble. Her hope in happiness beyond her experience was faint. Her</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">faith was dim. And no wonder. It seemed time she saw some one else’s</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">happiness, if not her own. It was hard to pour the words of faith, hope</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">and cheerfulness into the ear of another, when the fountain in her own</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">heart was failing. It was only a temporary darkening and failing of the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">spirit. A silent, earnest prayer, and all was clear and strong again.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">The room was provocative of thought, if not of pensiveness. It was so</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">still and warm and mellow, between the fire and the golden sunshine</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">coming softened through the curtains. And both girls were silent, while</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Kate leisurely plied her knitting-needles, and Carolyn contemplated the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">miniature. At last Miss Clifton spoke—</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Catherine, look upon that face. Study it. Should you believe, now, that</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">the owner of that beautiful face could be unrelenting, unforgiving?” And</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">she passed the miniature to her companion. Kate received it—glanced at</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">it. It was a faithful likeness of Archer Clifton. And those features, so</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">long unseen, and now suddenly revealed, thrilled with such electric</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">power to the heart of the girl, that after the first recognizing glance,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">she instantly returned it. And though her heart had paused in its</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">pulsations, and now throbbed thick and fast, she answered, calmly—</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“He is not unrelenting or unforgiving, Miss Clifton.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Oh! he is! he is! It has been fifteen months since we parted in anger,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">and no word or sign from him yet. Oh! Kate, what do you think of it?”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“I think he truly loves you, Miss Carolyn.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Oh! he _did_—he _did_, but I scorned and insulted him, and it is past,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">past!”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“There is no past tense to real love, lady.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Ah, Catherine, you speak of what you have had no experience in. My</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">scorn killed his love.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Real love is immortal, lady, it cannot be killed.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Ah, child, you speak without knowledge.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Without experimental knowledge, Miss Clifton. And all the highest</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">truths we have are obtained without experimental knowledge. I know that</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">true affection is undying, by the same light that without the Bible</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">shows me that God exists—that He made all souls, and that all souls are</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">immortal. It is one of the ‘self-evident’ truths. Ah, Miss Clifton, true</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">affection can no more be killed by scorn, than an angel could be</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">overcome by a demon, than Heaven could be conquered by hell. In the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">contest between true affection and scorn, it is affection must</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">conquer—scorn must yield. It must be so, lady. The heavens are pledged</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">to it. The sovereignty of the right is involved in it. And when, in such</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">a contest, affection fails, it is because it never was true. No, lady,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">true affection is never conquered. It is scorn that is conquered. It is</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">scorn that has yielded now. You do not scorn him now, lady.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“No—I would I could!”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Then, in the death of your own scorn see the immortality of his love.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">He will come back to you. He will come back the first free moment that</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">he has.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Ah, Catherine! In all this fifteen months he has not written to me.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“You do not know that, Miss Carolyn. _I_ believe that he has written to</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">you, and that the letter has been lost. You know how irregular and</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">uncertain the mail is from that distant frontier.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Catherine! I have been thinking of writing to him. What is your</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">opinion? What would you advise me to do?”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Not for the world, lady! For, trust me, for every step of advance a</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">woman makes, a man of high honor and fine sensibilities retreats.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Miss Clifton’s brow flushed, and she made a gesture, of impatience, as</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">she exclaimed—</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Then _why, why_ knowing that, does he not write?”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Because, perhaps, his first letters miscarried, and he stopped under</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">the supposition that you would not answer him. And then, lady, under all</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">these circumstances, the stiff pen and the cold paper cannot convey all</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">the burning words he would have to pour out at your feet. He will come!”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“‘He will come.’ Ah! in that very phrase is a knell deeper than all the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">rest! He will come! And what a spectre he will see in me! He cannot</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">continue to love me! Impossible! Impossible! He can never love such a</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">faded and scarred ruin as I am.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Dear Miss Clifton, I have told you so often that you are _not_ a ruin!</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Your face is very lovely, indeed it is! Fair and delicate and pensive,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">and far more attractive to all good hearts than ever it was in its high</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">bloom.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Ah, but faded—faded—faded!” mournfully replied Carolyn.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“And then, dear lady, true affection is of the soul. It has been said</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">that love is blind. It is not so. Love has Divine eyes, and creates the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">beauty that it looks upon. He will love you the more for the calamity</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">and sorrows that have fallen upon you. He will see a deeper beauty in</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">your pensive face, and his love will make it real.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Oh! impossible, I tell you! Impossible! The sight of me would shock</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">him. He would turn away.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Lady, do you love your cousin?”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“_Love him?_ Ah, God!”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Dear lady, if he had returned from the frontier with the loss of an</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">arm, a leg, or an eye—or with the hideous scar of a sword cut across</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">cheek and brow, could _you_ have turned from him revolted?”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Oh, no, no, no! Oh! Heaven, no! I should have done all I could to</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">convince him that he was beautiful to me still—that I loved him the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">deeper for his misfortunes!”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Then, dear lady, judge his noble heart by your own.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Ah, but you said yourself, just now, when advising me not to write,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">that men feel so differently from women!”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Yes, but not in tenderness—not in constancy!”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“There is the boy coming from the post-office, Catherine! It is</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">strange—it is strange—but though I have been disappointed a hundred</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">times, I still hope, and the coming of every mail makes my heart pause!</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Go, dear Catherine, and see what there is.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Kate rolled up her knitting, and dropped it into a little straw basket,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">and went below.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Only one letter, an’ the Pos’-Master say how it war for Miss Carolyn,”</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">said the boy below stairs.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">A letter for her at last! Carolyn’s heart stopped almost to death, until</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Kate ran back up the stairs, entered the room, and placed the letter in</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">her hands.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“It is from Richmond,” she said, in a disappointed tone, as she opened</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">it.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“From my Aunt Cabell,” she added, and began to read it while Kate</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">resumed her knitting.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“I hope your friends are all well,” said Catherine.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Yes—” replied Miss Clifton; and then a smile of amusement flitted over</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">her face—and still running her eye down the letter, she continued—“My</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Aunt Cabell writes me that my excellent step-dame, Mrs. Georgia Clifton,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">is now the reigning belle of Richmond—the most beautiful woman, the most</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">charming musician, the most fascinating waltzer, and the most elegant</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">equestrian in the city! She passes for a wealthy (!) young widow—and her</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">credit is unlimited, and her debts and her extravagance, of course,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">unbounded. She occupies a whole suit of rooms in the most expensive</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">hotel in the city, and entertains around her, both day and night, a host</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">of adoring worshipers. She has cut her father—worthy man—dead! She is</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">going to bring down a party of ladies and gentlemen to spend Christmas</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">at her country-seat, (!) White Cliffs. Now what do you think of that,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Catherine? Pray Heaven she may marry soon, and not wear our name long</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">enough to scandalize it! Mrs. Cabell goes on to say, that Mrs. Georgia</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">cannot long play that game—that Archer Clifton must soon return, and</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">take possession of his property, when it will be arrested. Alas! she</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">does not know that Captain Clifton is as much under the dominion of that</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">dangerous woman as it is possible to be. He will probably be proud to</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">leave Mrs. Clifton in possession here as long as she finds it convenient</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">or agreeable to stay. Now, what do you think of all this, Catherine?”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Dear lady, I know that you feel very unpleasantly, that all those gay</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">city strangers should be coming down here at Christmas, to turn the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">quiet house into a hall of orgies. But I do not see how you can prevent</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">it. You can elude it, though! You can go to Hardbargain, you know, and</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">remain until Mrs. Georgia and her guests have departed again. I would do</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">that.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“No, dear Catherine, there will be no necessity for that, either! My</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Aunt Cabell has anticipated my embarrassment, and proposed a plan. My</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">aunt and all her family are coming down here to spend the months of</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">October and November, while their city mansion is undergoing</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">repairs—painting, papering, and so on. And she proposes that I shall</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">return with her at the first of December, and pass the Winter in</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Richmond.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“And will you go?”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“I do not know. But, Kate, dear, you have comforted me so much, and</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">aunt’s account of Mrs. Georgia’s city airs has diverted me so much, that</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">I think I have spirits for a ride. Go order the horses, and tell Dandy</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">to be ready to attend us. We will go up to Hardbargain and take tea with</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Aunt Clifton, and amuse her with this letter!”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2"><span class="Apple-converted-space">                  </span>* <span class="Apple-converted-space">      </span>* <span class="Apple-converted-space">      </span>* <span class="Apple-converted-space">      </span>* <span class="Apple-converted-space">      </span>*</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Mrs. Cabell and her daughters, attended by Major Cabell, arrived in due</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">time, and were received with great pleasure by their orphaned relative.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">And Catherine, now that she was no longer necessary to the cheerfulness</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">of Miss Clifton, took leave and returned to her brother’s cot. Life in</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">the mansion, and life in the hut, like day and night, about equally</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">divided the girl’s experience—a strange lot, to be ever alternating</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">between luxury and refinement, and poverty and coarseness. And though it</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">was a wonderfully strengthening discipline, Kate found the contrast so</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">painful as to wish that life would change—in some way.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">A month passed away—during which she heard nothing whatever from White</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Cliffs. She was therefore in total ignorance of what was going on there,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">until one cold morning that had succeeded a snow-stormy night, while she</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">was shoveling away the snow in front of the cottage door, Dandy rode up</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">and delivered her a note from Miss Clifton. The note ran thus:</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“DEAR CATHERINE,—</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“I am going to leave for Richmond with Aunt Clifton to-morrow morning.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Come over, dear girl, and let me take leave of you before I start.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Come, my good, wise Catherine, for I want to consult you about a</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>certain matter.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2"><span class="Apple-converted-space">                                                  </span>“Your friend CAROLYN.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Kate saddled her pony and set out, attended by Dandy. As soon as she</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">arrived at White Cliffs, she was invited immediately up into Miss</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Clifton’s room. She found the young lady surrounded with trunks and</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">bandboxes, and busy with her maids, packing. Carolyn dismissed her</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">attendants, begged Kate to be seated, and sat down by her. After a few</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">mutual inquiries about health and so on, and a little introductory</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">conversation, and some considerable hesitation, Miss Clifton said—</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Catherine! I think—I hope that I have succeeded at last in emancipating</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">myself from the degrading slavery of that old love spell! At last the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">dread sense of bereavement and desolation is deadened.... If I were to</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">see him again, however, I do not know how it might be.... Perhaps,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">though, I shall never see him again.... Kate! I have had a proposal for</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">marriage.... My cousin Major Cabell!... It was at least generous in him,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">all things considered.... Family feeling, I suppose.... Kate, I think of</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">accepting him!... We owe something to our position in society.... My</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Aunt Cabell has been talking to me about it for a month past.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Miss Clifton made this communication in a hesitating, disjointed manner;</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">while Catherine looked and listened in grief and astonishment, feeling</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">regret amounting almost to remorse, that she had left her friend,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">enfeebled in mind and body, so long under the influence of a</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">strong-willed thoroughly worldly-minded woman. And she understood the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">instinct that had impelled the wavering girl to send for _her_ to steady</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">her. And then athwart these, her purest emotions, swept a dark, burning</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">impulse, like a breath of hell. It was the whisper of the devil, and it</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">said to her,—“Agree with her—agree with her! Let her marry another if</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">she wishes, and thus remove the greatest impediment that separates you</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">from the love, the hope of Archer Clifton.” Catherine stood for a moment</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">horrified by the darkness of the temptation. But then summoning the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">whole strength of her soul, she inwardly exclaimed, “Get thee behind me,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Satan!” And the devil fled from her.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“You do not answer me, Catherine. My dear girl, I have so much</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">confidence in your rectitude of mind! Advise me!”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Dear Miss Clifton, _never_, as you value your whole life’s peace and</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">rectitude—_never_, for any purpose whatever—under any temptation</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">whatever—consent to marry a man you do not love; _never_, as you hope</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">for earthly content—as you trust in God—_never_ put an insurmountable</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">object between yourself and one you love! How criminal to become a wife,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">while you love another living man! How terrible to find out, when it is</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">too late, that he loves you still! Perhaps from year to year to long for</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">the—! Lady, I have no words strong enough to express to you all that I</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">feel and fear on this subject! Grave faults sometimes follow little</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">errors! I would fain gain your promise not to entertain any gentleman’s</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">suit until you have met again with Captain Clifton. You cannot have long</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">to wait. He _must_ return to settle up this estate. And legal business,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">if nothing else, must bring you together!”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Alas! alas! no! the affairs of this property will be settled by his</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">attorney. Kate, I am very miserable!”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Dear lady, I know it! Do not, when tempted by hopelessness, do that</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">which you may regret all your life! That which may shut out the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">possibility of happiness forever! I wish I could go to Richmond with</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">you.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Oh, I wish you could! I think that you could save me from danger,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Kate.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“I think you want an honest friend near you, Miss Clifton! But, one</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">thing you can do—you can resolve not to form any matrimonial engagement</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">until you have again met with Captain Clifton. And you can bind your</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">resolution by a promise. Promise _me_, dear lady, by the interest I take</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">in you, to hold yourself free from entanglements, until you see your</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">cousin!”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Kate!—yes, I solemnly promise you, by all I hold sacred, that I will do</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">as you advise in this matter! And, Kate, enfeebled as I am, or may</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">become, in mind or body, I cannot break my pledged word! Good girl! You</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">have saved me again! Oh, Kate! Kate! do you think I don’t know the full</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">extent of your disinterestedness? Oh, Kate! noble girl! God reward you!”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Catherine began to tremble so violently, that Miss Clifton threw her</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">arms around her, and pressed her to her bosom, whispering,</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Never fear, dear girl! sweet girl! I will not breathe another word! I</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">would as soon sacrilegiously snatch the veil from the sanctuary, as</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">breathe another word about it!”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2"><span class="Apple-converted-space">                  </span>* <span class="Apple-converted-space">      </span>* <span class="Apple-converted-space">      </span>* <span class="Apple-converted-space">      </span>* <span class="Apple-converted-space">      </span>*</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">When Catherine reached home in the afternoon, she found a message</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">waiting her, from Mrs. Clifton, of Hardbargain. She went up immediately</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">to the farm-house, and found that lady looking very happy.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Catherine, my dear, sit down. I have good news. I have just received a</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">letter from Archer. He will be in Richmond in four days from this! But</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">his duties are such that he will not be able to leave Richmond for some</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">weeks. He begs me to meet him there! He has been promoted, Kate! He is</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">now Major Clifton, and has been appointed aid-de-camp to the Governor!”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“I am rejoiced to hear it, madam,” replied Kate, calmly, though her</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">heart stood still with the suddenness of this news. “You will send over</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">and inform Miss Clifton, will you not, madam?”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“No, I think not, Catherine. Why excite and disturb her on the eve of a</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">journey? Besides, Catherine, I have many misgivings! This long</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">persistence in silence—his never mentioning her name in any of his few</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">letters to me! his never replying to the letter I wrote upon the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">subject!—all this is foreboding! I must not meddle farther in this</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">affair until I have seen my son, and can judge his state of mind in</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">regard to it!... But, Catherine, my dear, I sent for you for this: I am</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">going to Richmond on Tuesday, for the purpose of spending some weeks</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">near my son. I need a female companion, and I have your grandfather’s</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">and your brother’s consent for you to accompany me; that is, if you are</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">willing. Will you go with me, Kate?”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“I shall be very glad to do so, indeed, Mrs. Clifton!” said the young</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">girl.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Then return home at once, Kate, and prepare for the journey. You will</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">have a great deal to do, to make things comfortable for your grandfather</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">and brother during your absence, and to get yourself ready for your city</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">visit.”</span></p>

<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">On her arrival at Richmond, Mrs. Clifton engaged for herself and</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Catherine two rooms—a chamber with two beds, and a neat adjoining</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">parlor—in a quiet, retired boardinghouse.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Miss Clifton was the guest of Mrs. Cabell, in the most fashionable</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">quarter of the city. Captain Clifton had not yet arrived, but was daily</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">expected. Richmond was in the commencement of the fashionable season,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">and was already quite full of gay company. Every evening witnessed some</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">one or two grand balls, or great private parties. The theatres and the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">concert rooms were in full operation. But no faint echo of all these</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">various forms of revelry came to the sequestered neighborhood that Mrs.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Clifton had chosen for her retreat. No news of the fashionable world</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">reached her, except constant bulletins of Mrs. Georgia Clifton’s</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">progress through society. She was one of those city celebrities whose</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">sayings and doings are the exciting topic of all classes. Where she</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">went, and what she wore, and when she rode out. Whom she cut directly,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">whom she smiled upon, whom she slighted, and whom she received, were the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">most interesting subjects of discussion. The Belle of the Rappahannock,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">the Dark Ladye, the Gipsy Beauty, were some of the many names she had</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">won. All these matters were freely and lightly commented upon in Mrs.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Clifton’s presence, by gentlemen boarders, who knew nothing whatever of</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">that lady’s connexion with the reigning toast of Richmond. Mrs. Clifton</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">rested two days before calling upon Mrs. Cabell and her family. Miss</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Clifton expressed almost as much surprise as pleasure at the sight of</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">her aunt, but forbore to question her motive in coming so suddenly to</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">the city. Perhaps Carolyn had heard a rumor of Major Clifton’s</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">preferment and expected arrival, and for that reason was silent. Mrs.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Clifton never named the subject during her informal call. At taking</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">leave she left her address, and informed her niece that Kate Kavanagh</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">was in town with her. Carolyn expressed much pleasure at hearing this,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">and promised to call very soon. The very next day Mrs. Cabell came in</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">her carriage, and invited and urged Mrs. Clifton and her protégé to</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">return with her, and make her house their home during their sojourn in</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Richmond. After some hesitation and reflection, Mrs. Clifton accepted</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">the invitation, and promised to go over the next day. The next morning,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">therefore, Mrs. Cabell sent her carriage to convey Mrs. Clifton and</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Catherine. They were received by Mrs. Cabell with great politeness and</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">_empressement_, and conducted by that lady herself into two large and</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">luxuriously furnished chambers, connected with each other, where they</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">found a neat, pretty mulatto girl, ready to wait upon them—for Mrs.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Cabell, with all her hard worldliness, was truly kind and hospitable.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">The evening of the succeeding day was the appointed time for the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Governor’s first reception. Mrs. Cabell and her family were going, of</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">course. And Mrs. Clifton resolved to go—not for her own sake, but for</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">that of Catherine, whom she had determined should see all that was to be</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">seen during her stay in the metropolis. A somewhat haughty surprise</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">elevated the handsome black eyebrows of Mrs. Cabell, when she found that</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Mrs. Clifton intended to take her _demoiselle du compagnie_, but she was</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">far too well bred to express it in any other manner. And as for Mrs.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Clifton, she always did whatever she thought proper to do, in the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">coolest, calmest, most matter-of-course manner, without the slightest</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">regard to other people’s weaknesses and follies. You know, besides, that</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">she was a thorough republican. And Mrs. Cabell remembered that the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">public reception at the gubernatorial mansion was a sort of _omnium</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">gatherum_, where all who behaved themselves might come—from the oldest</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Major-General of the army to the shoemaker who made his boots. And</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">again, no one in Richmond knew who the girl really was. All these things</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">had Mrs. Cabell to recall to mind before she could reconcile herself to</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">the idea of Kate’s being of the party.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">When the night and the hour arrived, several gentlemen, beaux of the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Misses Cabell, came to escort the ladies. Major Cabell attended his</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">cousin Carolyn and one of his sisters. Judge Cabell took charge of his</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">wife and eldest daughter. Mrs. Clifton had hoped that her son would have</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">reached the city in time to have escorted herself and Catherine. When</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">they were all assembled in the parlor, Major Cabell brought a gentleman</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">up to Mrs. Clifton, whom he presented as Colonel Conyers, of the army,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">leaving to Mrs. Clifton the responsibility of presenting the aristocrat</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">to the plebeian Kate. Mrs. Clifton did it at once, in the most natural</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">way in the world. And the gallant Colonel, after a few compliments,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">hoped to have the honor of waiting upon Mrs. Clifton and her “lovely</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">charge” to the Mansion-House. Mrs. Clifton gratefully accepted his</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">services—and soon after, they entered the carriage, and were driven off.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">This party reached their destination a full half hour before Mrs. Cabell</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">and family, and other ultra fashionables, who fancied that it was vulgar</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">to go early, and imagined that their _ton_ depended upon late hours and</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">other observances. Mrs. Clifton was very plainly dressed, in a black</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">satin with a lace scarf—Catherine very simply, in a white crape, with a</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">scarlet geranium twined in her black hair. A moment in the cloak-room</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">sufficed to re-arrange their simple toilet. They were then conducted</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">into the saloon. This apartment was fitted up in a somewhat different</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">style to those of the present day. It was illuminated by three large</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">hanging chandeliers, holding innumerable wax candles; and warmed by two</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">enormous coal fires, one at each extremity. It was already well filled</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">with a miscellaneous company. After their presentation to the Governor,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Colonel Conyers inquired whether they chose to join the promenade or to</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">take seats. Mrs. Clifton preferred the latter, and their polite escort</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">conducted them to a side sofa, from which they could note the entrance</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">of fresh guests, and watch the great circle of promenaders going round</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">and round in one long elliptic, three or four persons deep, in the most</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">stupid, treadmill monotony conceivable. Very much interested and amused</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">was our simple country girl, in taking observations of the various</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">characters passing in review before them. Here would be a dowager of</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">sixty, in rouge, ringlets, bare arms and a gossamer dress; here a girl</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">of seventeen, in a black, stiff brocade and heavy head-dress. Here comes</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">a stately, broad-chested, senatorial-looking man—he _looks_ the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">incumbent of some high, official place—he _is_ the master tailor, of ——</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">street. Here comes a red-headed, red-faced, sharp-featured little man,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">very quick and impatient in his motions, and very high in his voice—he</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">looks like an auctioneer or a constable—he is the great General ——, of</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">the United States Army. Here is a small, dowdy woman, all fuss and</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">flowers, like a barn-house actress—she is the wife of the late Governor</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">——. This is a queenly woman! tall, stately, dignified, with a fine,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">royal countenance. Pooh! Don’t ask who she is—she is the “leading lady”</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">at the city theatre—plays in all the heavy tragedies, but is not even a</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">star. There, apart, watching and reflecting upon the scene, stands a</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">grave-looking individual, in a closely-fitting black suit, and</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">closely-cropped black hair, and set, sallow, saturnine face, looking</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">like an undertaker at a funeral—doubtless some famous preacher—though so</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">miserable a messenger of the glad tidings cannot be imagined. Preacher,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">indeed! Why, he is H——, the low comedian, and he wears his hair cropped</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">that way by reason of the many different sorts of wigs he has to wear in</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">his different impersonations. To-night, he happens to be off the boards,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">and enjoys the recreation of sadness and gravity. Ah! here is a</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">debonnair gentleman! all life! a laugh and jest, or a smile and a bow</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">for every one. Is he a French dancing-master? No—he is the Rev. Mr. ——,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">the most popular preacher of the day. Yet these were not all. There</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">_was_ a small proportion of really well-dressed and dignified women and</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">stately, honorable men.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“How do you like the scene, Catherine?” asked Mrs. Clifton.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Kate laughed—then replied—</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“I am somewhat disappointed, but very much more diverted! It seems to me</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">so strange that people should look, dress and behave so very</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">inappropriately! and that they could possibly be so very ill-dressed and</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">dowdy at such a great expense. I expected something very recherché and</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">elegant in the saloon of the Governor’s mansion. But ‘motley is the only</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">wear!’”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">The officer laughed, gayly, and then observed—</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Why? Why did you look for something, or rather, for everything</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">recherché and elegant in this crowd? Because you see in the newspaper</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">reports of such gatherings, such phrases as ‘the beautiful Miss A——?’—by</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">the way, there she is—the young lady with the red hair, milk-white</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">complexion and little eyes; or ‘the elegant Mrs. B——?’ ‘the graceful</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Mrs. C——?’ etc., etc., etc., with revised and improved accounts of their</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">costume, appearance, manners, etc.? Miss Kavanagh, when you have stayed</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">in the city longer, you will know that when a newspaper reporter and</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">letter writer speaks of that dowdy, but wealthy little woman, in the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">flimsy, scarlet dress, as ‘the beautiful, elegant, and accomplished Mrs.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">G——,’ and tells of ‘the immense (imaginary) sensation’ she made—_he_,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">the reporter, is morally certain of an invitation to her private</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">parties.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Kate did not like his sarcastic tone, but before she could make any sort</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">of reply, her attention was called to a rising excitement in the room.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Every gentleman, from the fidgety little Major General, down to the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">grave and dignified low comedian; and every lady, from the ex-Governor’s</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">fussy widow, to the stately and self-possessed stock actress, were on</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">the _qui vive_. Kate, while listening and watching for the cause of the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">excitement, caught a few phrases that helped to enlighten her—they were</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">of this sort:—“A wonder! a perfect wonder! A miracle of dark beauty.”</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“The wealthiest woman in the state, but that is nothing to her marvelous</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">beauty.” “Did you see her as ‘_Egypt_,’ at the fancy ball?” “Her</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">portrait, in oil, by ——, stands in Stationers’ Hall. It has attracted</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">crowds.” “No—I have seen the engraving from it in ‘Beauty’s Annual’ for</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">this year. But I have also seen it on the tops of cigar boxes—too bad!”</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Hush! here she comes!”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Catherine turned her eyes in the direction towards which all others were</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">gazing. It was Georgia—dark, bright, and more beautiful and bewitching</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">than ever. Her dress was of lustrous black _crape-de-lise_, sprinkled</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">over with gold spangles, that gleamed in and out through the dark,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">transparent drapery, suggesting clear, starlight night. A crowd entered</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">with the star-bright Circe—a crowd attended her during all her progress</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">through the room.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">We must leave Georgia to her alluring wiles, and Catherine to her</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">observations, and seek Mrs. Cabell and her party. They are in the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">dressing-room, and about to leave it. Only Mrs. Cabell turns again and</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">again to survey her form in the mirror, and re-adjust the flow of her</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">purple satin dress, or the wave of her white ostrich plumes. When all is</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">done, she turns for the last time to Carolyn, to rebuke her for not</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">adding a single ornament to her mourning dress of black velvet, which is</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">relieved only by the falls of fine Brussels lace on the neck and arms,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">and the sunny ringlets falling all around her head as low as the throat.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Carolyn looks very fragile, but interesting and lovely, though she does</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">not know it. Major Cabell gave his right arm to his mother, and his left</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">to his cousin, and so, as it was now the acme of the fashionable hour,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">they entered the saloon, and made their slow progress up to the upper</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">end, where the Governor and staff stood, to receive all comers—Mrs.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Cabell bowing and smiling to such acquaintances as she chose to</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">recognize in passing, until at length they stopped. A feeling of false</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">shame, a morbid notion that all eyes were upon her, and scrutinized the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">few pits hidden under the golden curls on her temples, had caused</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Carolyn to cast her eyes down, and keep them down, during the whole</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">progress through the room—and though her acute ears heard such murmurs</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">as these—“How fair she is,” “But how fragile, as if a zephyr would blow</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">her away”—she never fancied they were breathed of her, and never</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">surmised the admiration she elicited. “Governor T——, Miss Clifton, of</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Clifton,” were the words that admonished Carolyn she was standing before</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">the great man, and must look up and curtsy. She curtsied before she</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">looked up, and when she raised her eyes, she saw only Archer Clifton</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">before her, who bowed when he met her glance! The Governor and many</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">others were there, but how could she see any one but Archer Clifton!</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">But, oh! the perversity of human nature! As soon as she met his eyes,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">all the pride and scorn of her proudest, most scornful days, returned</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">upon her with a vengeance—all the more fiercely, ferociously, that she</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">believed herself a fright, and found Archer Clifton handsomer, more</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">dignified, higher in favor with God and man than ever! Major Cabell was</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">about to pass on instantly with his ladies, to give place to the next</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">arrivals. Returning Archer Clifton’s bow with a haughty bend, she threw</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">up her head and swept on with the most superb air of arrogance</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">imaginable. They joined the promenaders—Carolyn all the more unhappy for</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">her show of hauteur—the heart beneath that erected head and expanded</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">chest almost breaking with chagrin. Captain, now Major Clifton, stood at</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">the right hand of the Governor, with his eyes roving calmly over the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">miscellaneous assembly, until they chanced to rest upon the stately form</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">of his mother when they lighted up with surprise and pleasure, and</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">excusing himself from his official attendance, he bowed and withdrew, to</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">hasten to the distant sofa, where she sat alone. Catherine, on the arm</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">of Colonel Conyers, was lost in the slowly revolving crowd of</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">promenaders. He reached Mrs. Clifton’s side, and—</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“My dearest mother!”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“My dear Archer!” were the greetings exchanged between them with the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">clasped hands.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“How delighted I am to see you, yet how tantalizing to meet you in this</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">public assembly, after so long an absence!”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“When did you reach the city, Archer?”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Within the last half hour! Having important dispatches for the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Governor, I came at once hither.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“I did not see you enter.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“I came in by the private entrance, and joined his excellency’s circle</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">directly. But, my dearest mother! I scarcely hoped you would be in</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">town—how long have you been here?”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“About four days, Archer.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Suddenly both became grave and thoughtful—they were occupied with the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">same thoughts—of the calamities that had befallen mutual friends since</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">their last parting. They were silent—they did not like to sadden this</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">first meeting by referring to the mournful subject. And before either</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">knew of her approach, Mrs. Georgia had glided swiftly and silently up to</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">them. Now, Mrs. Georgia had passed and repassed Mrs. Clifton a score of</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">times that evening, without once noticing her. But now that Archer</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Clifton sat by his mother’s side, the Circe appeared before them, dark,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">resplendent, alluring as ever. She was leaning upon the arm of the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Lieutenant-Governor. Archer Clifton sprang up immediately, and greeted</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">her with surprise and pleasure. Dismissing her escort with a charming</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">smile and wave of the hand she sank gracefully, languishingly into the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">seat by the side of Mrs. Clifton, and glided into her own fascinating</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">style of conversation. After a few minutes, Archer Clifton seemed quite</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">lost to everything else, in the charm of the syren’s society, until a</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">certain, sweet, enticing restlessness on the part of the beauty,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">suggested to him the propriety of inviting her to promenade. She arose</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">with a bewildering smile, that quite drove his mother out of his head,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">and slipped her arm through his. They joined the promenaders. In the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">meantime, Kate Kavanagh, on the arm of Colonel Conyers, was moving</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">around in the same circle, highly amused in making observations, and</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">scarcely appreciating the sincere admiration of her escort, that was</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">apparent to every one else, especially to the correspondent of the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Fiddle-de-dee, who, in his next letter, in giving an account of the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">reception, made an item of the manifest admiration of the gallant and</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">distinguished Colonel C——, for the beautiful and accomplished Miss K——.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Catherine at length thought that her kind patroness might be lonely, and</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">expressed a wish to rejoin her. In turning to retrace their steps, they</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">met face to face with Archer Clifton and his companion. Major Clifton</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">recognized the poor mountain-girl in that saloon, with a look of</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">supercilious surprise, and Mrs. Georgia looked calmly through her body</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">without seeing her at all. With a slight bow, Major Clifton passed on</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">with his companion. And as for Kate, her heart had a habit of standing</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">perfectly still in an emergency, and now it had stopped so suddenly, and</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">stood still so long, that she was on the verge of fainting.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“You are not well. You are wearied. You have remained on your feet too</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">long. Let me take you to a seat, Miss Kavanagh,” said the Colonel. With</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">a gasp and a shiver, Kate recovered and rejoined Mrs. Clifton. And she</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">permitted herself to fall into no more weakness that night. But Kate had</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">unconsciously betrayed her secret to the officer. And by the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">interference of her good angel, this knowledge thus obtained, enabled</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Colonel Conyers to do Kate a service of vital importance in after years.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Archer is come,” said Mrs. Clifton, as Catherine took her seat.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“I know it. I met him,” replied Catherine, and both fell into silence,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">for at that instant Major Clifton and the beautiful Georgia passed them.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">And from that time, and so long as they sat there, again and again in</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">the slow revolving of the great circle of promenaders, the pair passed</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">and repassed them—Georgia smiling, cooing, murmuring, in her low,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">alluring music—and Archer Clifton, bending over her with his brilliant</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">gray eyes, feeding on her lovely face, seeming to sink deeper and deeper</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">into the bathos of her charms, while Carolyn turned sick with jealousy,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">and Catherine faint with dread, and the correspondent of the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Fiddle-de-dee made a note of the distinguished favor with which the most</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">beautiful Mrs. C——, the reigning belle of Richmond, received the devoirs</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">of her distant relative, the celebrated Major C——. Fear nothing,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Carolyn, or Catherine, Archer Clifton is not in love with his uncle’s</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">widow—that very relationship would repel the idea, if nothing else. But</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">he is not indifferent to the honor of monopolizing the reigning queen of</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">the ton.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Aunt Cabell,” said Carolyn, “I cannot sit up longer. I _must_ go home.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">And Mrs. Cabell consented to gratify her wish. In fact it was growing</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">late, and the ultra fashionables, the last to come, and the first to</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">leave, were beginning to disappear. Mrs. Georgia unwillingly discovered</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">this fact, but she thought that at least she could adroitly secure the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">services of her companion as an escort home, and detain him to any hour</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">in the little paradise of her own boudoir. She therefore expressed</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">herself ennuied, and entreated Major Clifton to conduct her to the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">cloak-room. He attended her thither. And there he met again his Cousin</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Carolyn. She looked so fair, so wan, so fragile, that he could not for a</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">moment take his eyes from her. He hastily adjusted the mantle over the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">shoulders of Georgia, handed her her muff and hood, and excusing himself</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">for a moment, hurried back to his mother’s side.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“You have company home, madam, have you not?”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Certainly, Archer. I should not be here without such a provision—here</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">comes Colonel Conyers now to attend us.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Good-night, then! I will see you early to-morrow! Good-night, Kate!” He</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">was off.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Mrs. Cabell and Carolyn, leaning on Major Cabell’s arms, reached their</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">carriage door. The Major dropped his cousin’s arm a moment to assist his</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">mother in, and to settle her in her seat. And during that moment Carolyn</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">felt an arm passed around her waist, and a voice whisper—</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Carolyn—my beloved cousin! my bride! am I forgiven?”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">She burst into tears and dropped her proud head on his bosom,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">exclaiming—</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Oh, Archer! am _I_ forgiven?”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">He placed her in the carriage, and springing in past Major Cabell, took</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">the seat by her side, leaving the Major to follow as he could, and</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">forgetting the very existence of Mrs. Georgia.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Kate was close to them—she saw and heard it all. Nodding her head slowly</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">several times, she murmured—</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Thank God. Thank God! Oh, Merciful Father, help me to say that</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">sincerely. Thank God!”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Three weeks after this they were married. The ceremony was performed in</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">the ancient church of St. John’s on Richmond Hill—one of the oldest</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">places of worship on the whole continent. Mrs. Cabell would willingly</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">have made this event the occasion of a great deal of ostentatious</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">display; but the recent afflictions in the family, and the fragility of</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">the bride, rendered other arrangements necessary. Therefore, immediately</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">after the ceremony, which came off at an early hour of the morning, the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">newly-married couple, taking advantage of the very fine weather,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">departed for Norfolk, with the intention of sailing thence to Havana,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">where, by the advice of an eminent physician, for the re-establishment</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">of the bride’s health, they purposed to spend the winter.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Mrs. Georgia Clifton, with all the other members of the family</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">connection, had, of course, been present at the marriage. And no one was</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">so lavish of smiles, tears, caresses, and congratulations, as the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">dark-eyed syren. But when all was over, and the bridal pair had</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">departed, refusing the invitation of Mrs. Cabell to go home and dine</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">with a party of friends, she hurried to her lodgings, pushed open the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">door of her luxurious boudoir, fastened it on the inside, and threw</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">herself down, rolling over, tearing at the carpet, and gnashing her</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">teeth in an agony of disappointment, jealousy and impotent rage.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">But not long did the Circe of Richmond yield herself up to anguish and</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">despair. Christmas was approaching, when she was expected to entertain a</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">select number of her worshipers at White Cliffs. It was expedient that</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">she should go down a few days in advance of the party, to make ready for</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">their reception. Therefore, about five days after the marriage, she left</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">the city.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Mrs. Clifton remained a week longer in town, to give Catherine an</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">opportunity of attending a course of lectures on Moral Philosophy. And</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">their escort every evening was Colonel Conyers.</span></p>

<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">It was always Mrs. Clifton’s rule to spend Christmas at home—so she</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">arranged to leave Richmond on the twenty-third. It was three o’clock on</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">the dark, cold, winter morning, that the stage called for them. Our</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">travelers were muffled up to the ears in hoods, cloaks, shawls and furs,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">and when they entered the coach, they seemed to fill up all the back. It</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">was so dark that they could see nothing, and the stage seemed to be</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">vacant of other passengers than themselves; until Mrs. Clifton, settling</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">her own outer garments, spoke, cautioning Catherine to fold her cloak</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">carefully about her. Then another voice spoke, from the opposite seat,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">exclaiming, in a tone of surprise and pleasure—</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Why, is it possible! Mrs. Clifton and Miss Kavanagh?”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Yes, Colonel Conyers, and I am as much pleased as surprised to find you</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">here! How comes it that we are fellow travelers?” said the lady, placing</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">her own in his offered hand.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“And how-do-you-do, Miss Kavanagh?—really, I am so overjoyed to find you</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">here! Why, you must know, my dear Mrs. Clifton, that I have been due at</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">White Cliffs for several days. I am, in fact, the laggard of a party—but</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">in truth I could not tear myself from Richmond, while you and Miss</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Kavanagh remained. But last night, after taking leave of you, as I</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">supposed, for some length of time,—under great depression of spirits,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Miss Kavanagh,—I sent and had a place taken in this stage, for L——,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">which I understand to be the nearest stage station to White Cliffs. Why,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">how little did I suspect that we were to travel by the same coach!</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Truly, ‘life is full of paper walls.’ A word dropped by either of us,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">last night, would have revealed the fact to the other! But how delighted</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">I am, Miss Kavanagh! And may I hope, Mrs. Clifton, that our journey lies</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">for some distance together?”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“For the whole distance, I am happy to say. The plantation of White</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Cliffs and the farm of Hardbargain join. Our journey terminates at L——.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Really! Why this is excellent! So, instead of being separated, we shall</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">travel all the way together, and then continue to be neighbors for some</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">weeks! Miss Kavanagh, I am overjoyed.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">There was not much traveling at that season of the year, so our party of</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">three had the coach to themselves, and Colonel Conyers devoted himself</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">with great assiduity to the comfort of the ladies.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">At the end of the second day, just as the level beams of the setting sun</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">were gilding all the village windows, the stage rolled into L——.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">There, before the little tavern door, waited Mrs. Clifton’s</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">old-fashioned carriage.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Did you notify the family of White Cliffs of your intended arrival here</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">to-day?” asked Mrs. Clifton, of Colonel Conyers.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“No, madam! My journey was resolved upon so suddenly—out of ‘my grief</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">and my impatience’ at the supposed loss of your own and Miss Kavanagh’s</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">society—that I had no time to write.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Ah! that is the reason why their carriage is not waiting for you.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Colonel Conyers, if you will take a seat with us to Hardbargain, and</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">rest for a few hours or a few days as you please, we shall be very glad,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">and we shall furnish you with a conveyance to White Cliffs whenever you</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">wish to go.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Colonel Conyers expressed himself but too happy to accept Mrs. Clifton’s</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">invitation, and they all entered the old-fashioned carriage, and set out</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">for Hardbargain. The farm was nine miles distant, and the road the very</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">roughest, even of mountain turnpikes. Colonel Conyers ventured to wonder</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">how any carriage could stand it, and surmised that R—— County must be</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">blessed with the best wheelwrights in the world—to which Mrs. Clifton</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">replied that they _had_ the very best to be met with anywhere.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">It was ten o’clock at night when they reached Hardbargain, but they</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">found the hall lighted up, fires blazing in the parlor, and the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">dining-room, and a substantial supper waiting for the order of the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">mistress. The farm-house looked cheerful, hospitable, and inviting; and</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Colonel Conyers rubbed his hands in delight. He remained over night. The</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">next day was Christmas, and nothing but the binding engagement to render</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">an account of himself to the beautiful Georgia at least by Christmas,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">could have forced him to White Cliffs that day. He accepted Mrs.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Clifton’s cordial invitation to come over often while he remained in the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">neighborhood. In fact, Mrs. Clifton had seen that Colonel Conyers was</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">very much pleased with Catherine, and felt desirous that he should have</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">an opportunity of winning the affections of her favorite. Colonel</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Conyers took the largest advantage of Mrs. Clifton’s hospitality, and</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">not even the charms of the syren of White Cliffs, could wile him away</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">from his daily evening ride over to Hardbargain. And so, after a few</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">weeks—as there is no accounting for tastes, and as the most</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">extraordinary things sometimes really do happen—it turned out that</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Colonel Conyers actually did lay his heart, hand and fortune at the feet</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">of the humble girl whom his own subordinate officer, Captain Clifton,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">had despised, and, farthermore, that he was rejected by her! Yes!</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">gratefully, kindly, but firmly and finally rejected! And full of</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">disappointment, humiliation and sorrow, the gallant Colonel abruptly</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">concluded his visit, and returned to town.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Oh, Catherine, my dear, if you could but have liked him well enough to</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">have married him. He is an honest, kind-hearted man,” said Mrs. Clifton,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">with a sigh of regret.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Yes, he is a good man. Heaven bless him with a good wife,” answered</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Kate.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Neither of these unworldly women once reverted to the advantages of rank</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">resigned with the rejected lover.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">And soon Catherine had other thoughts and occupations than those</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">connected with courtship and marriage. The situation of her grandfather</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">demanded all her care. For many months before this, the long and</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">persevering efforts of the patient girl had been blessed with success,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">and the old man had abandoned the use of intoxicating spirits. But</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">within the last few weeks the total disuse of the stimulant to which he</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">was morbidly accustomed, had began to produce the most dangerous effects</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">upon his aged and infirm frame. He grew weaker and still weaker, until</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">at length he was confined to his bed. And so he slowly sank and failed</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">as weeks—weary weeks—dragged on to months. And through all this dreary</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">time, day and night, Catherine faithfully nursed him. Many a night she</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">sat the only watcher by his bedside, hourly expecting his death; and</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">many a morning he revived again, so deep a hold had life upon that old,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">worn body. Scarcely for necessary food or rest would Catherine leave</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">him, always watching, waiting on and cheering him, sometimes—whenever he</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">desired it—reading the Bible to him, singing or praying with him. In</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">vain Mrs. Clifton noticing the care-worn, toil-worn, emaciated</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">countenance of the girl, besought her to take care of her own health.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Catherine cared for nothing on earth so much as the aged man daily</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">fading away from her sight. And so passed the winter. And so opened the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">spring. And then his old disease, if it could be called a disease, took</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">a most alarming turn. After a paroxysm more violent than ever had come</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">on him before, he fell into a state of greater prostration. And the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">physician hastily summoned, declared that another such attack would be</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">fatal, and that only the use of brandy could ward the fit off, and save</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">his life. Carl Wetzel replied that he felt if he should taste the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">intoxicating liquid again, the fatal appetite for alcohol would return</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">upon him with tenfold violence for the temporary abstinence, and that it</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">would totally subject him to its dominion. The doctor called him a fool</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">and a fanatic, without self-control or self-reliance, and left him to</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">his fate. When the physician had left the hut, the old man called his</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">grand-daughter to his bedside.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Kate, you heard what the doctor said?”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Kate nodded—her heart was too full for speech.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“My dear child—my dear, good Kate!—he says that unless I drink brandy I</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">shall die. But, Kate, if I taste brandy again, I feel I shall live—a</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">drunkard! Kate, I know you are wise and good beyond your years. Kate, I</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">have full faith in you! My child, I will do as you decide for me.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Darling, shall I drink or die?”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Kate sank upon her knees by his bedside, took both his venerable hands</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">and kissed and pressed them to her bosom, bowed her face over them, and</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">wept in silence. At last, raising her head, she gazed earnestly,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">reverently, lovingly in the old man’s face, and answered—</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Dearest grandfather, do not ask me, a poor, weak, erring girl! Dearest</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">grandfather, ask God!”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">The old man feebly raised his hand, and placed it on her head and</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">blessed her, adding—</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“I thank Thee, oh, Father! that out of the mouths of babes and sucklings</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Thou hast perfected praise!”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">The next morning, when the doctor came, he found the old man sinking</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">fast, yet clinging as human nature will cling, to the wish for—the hope</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">of—life.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Doctor, is there no other way of saving me than that you spoke of?”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“None, whatever, my good friend; unless you consent to save yourself by</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">taking alcohol, you must die.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Then I will die[1]!” replied Carl Wetzel.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Footnote 1:</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>A Fact</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">And within a week from this time the old man died and was buried.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">After the funeral was over, Mrs. Clifton invited and urged Catherine to</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">come and take up her permanent residence at Hardbargain. There were now</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">no reasons why Catherine should not, and many why she should, accept</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">this very advantageous offer.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Her brother Carl was about to bring home a wife, after which he would no</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">longer need Catherine’s services. And now that the spring had fully</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">opened, Mrs. Clifton’s health, as usual at that season, failed, and she</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">really needed the companionship and care of our unprofessed Sister of</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Charity. And, therefore, Catherine accepted her proposal, and came to</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">take possession of the room, Mrs. Clifton had fitted up for her</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">adjoining her own chamber. It had once been Archer Clifton’s room. That</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">was of no consequence to Catherine now, however. You need not now be</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">told again that the girl was a true Christian. She had great faith—she</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">believed in miracles, asserting that the days of miracles had not</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">passed—could not pass until the days of God’s Omnipotence and man’s</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">faith should be passed. When the passion of her heart was about to</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">become the sin of her soul, she prayed to God to remove the last vestige</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">of that erring, ill-fated love—and it was removed—gone! She could think</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">of him, speak of him, without an altered pulse. She knew that he and his</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">wife were soon expected at White Cliffs, and she felt that she would</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">meet them again without any other emotion than pleasure. On the day of</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">her removal to Hardbargain, Mrs. Clifton said to her—</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Catherine! I see by the Richmond Standard, that Archer has resigned his</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">post in the army.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“It is not possible, madam!”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Yes, indeed. I was very much astonished to see it.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“What in the world could have been his motive?”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“I cannot even form an idea. No motive was assigned in the paper.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“And did he never mention his intention to you in any of his letters?”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Never, Kate. But indeed, I have not heard from him for six weeks. I</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">cannot tell the reason why he does not write. Perhaps his letters have</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">been lost—the foreign mails are so irregular.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Was he at Havana when you heard from him last, madam?”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Yes, Catherine—but then he spoke of a speedy return home. They should</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">have been here long before this time, or at least, he should have</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">written to account for their delay. I send Henny regularly to the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">post-office—I have sent her to-day. I hope I may get a letter, though</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">the chances seem to diminish.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Even while they spoke, the girl came in with a letter in her hand. Mrs.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Clifton took it and looked at it, saying—</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“At last! It is from Havana, Catherine, from Archer.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">She opened it, and as she read it, her face became very grave. And</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">having finished, she fell into thought, and said—</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“It is as I feared.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“I trust there is no bad news, madam?” said Catherine.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“You shall hear, Kate,” replied the lady, taking up the letter and</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">reading as follows;</span></p>

<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“But, madam, let us hope better things. This sea voyage and residence in</span></p>

<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Never, Catherine. And it was even cruel in the doctors to send her</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">there, to die in a foreign land, among strangers. They had better have</span></p>

<p class="p3"><span class="s2">her heart was almost dry—and again she had to lift her heart to the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Divine source of all strength and light for new faith and hope. Little</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">else but suffering and sorrow had the girl seen since she came into the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">world—and no part had she filled in life but that of servant, nurse, or</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">comforter.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">The summer passed with Mrs. Clifton and Catherine in almost</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">uninterrupted retirement. They heard, at long intervals, from Major</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Clifton and his bride, and then the news was various and unsatisfactory.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Sometimes Carolyn was better, and there would be a talk of speedy</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">return, and, perhaps, the very next letter, after a long interval, would</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">speak of a season of prostration by extreme illness. And about the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">middle of the autumn, Mrs. Clifton received a letter from her son</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">announcing their intention of wintering in Lisbon. The irregular</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">arrivals of these bulletins were the most interesting, and nearly the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">_only_ interesting events of the summer and autumn, if we except a</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">descent upon White Cliffs by Mrs. Georgia and her friends. The syren,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">after her return from a summer tour to the fashionable watering places,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">determined to fill up the dull interim before the commencement of the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">season in town, by a visit to her “seat in R——,” as she persisted in</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">calling White Cliffs. Accordingly, she made up a party of idle ladies</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">and sporting gentlemen, and came down to spend September.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Colonel Conyers was among the guests. He renewed his visits to</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Hardbargain, and his suit to Catherine—received a second rejection, and</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">hurried off to town, under the sting of mortification as before. At the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">first of October, the “city riff raff,” as the old family servants of</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Clifton irreverently and indignantly called the moneyed aristocrats,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">returned to Richmond, whither they were shortly followed by their</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">beautiful hostess, to prepare for her winter campaign. From this time to</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">the middle of December, no event marked the even tenor of the life at</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Hardbargain. The inmates had not lately heard from Major Clifton. It was</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">near Christmas. In her anxiety to hear from Lisbon, Mrs. Clifton was in</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">the habit of sending to L—— twice a week, when the mail came in, and</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">sitting up till a very late hour, waiting for the return of the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">messenger.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">One evening after supper, Mrs. Clifton and Catherine sat each side their</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">work-stand, before the fire, awaiting the arrival of the boy who had</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">been dispatched to the post-office. So often had the lady thus sat and</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">waited, and been disappointed, that hope waxed very faint. This time,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">however, she was destined to have her heart gladdened by the full</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">fruition of hope. About nine o’clock the messenger returned and entered</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">the parlor with a packet of letters and papers. The boy’s face was</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">lighted up with sympathetic joy, and he exclaimed, as he handed the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">bundle—</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“I almos’ rid myself to death, mist’ess, I was so glad I had de letters</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">to bring yer.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“You have made great haste indeed, Neddy. Go tell Henny to give you your</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">supper,” said the lady.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Good boy,” said Kate, pressing his little sooty hand as he passed her</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">and went out.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Mrs. Clifton was reading a letter from Archer. It was written in a glad,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">buoyant spirit and contained the best possible news. Against all hope,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Carolyn’s health since her arrival at Lisbon had steadily improved, and</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">it was now so far re-established, that they were already looking forward</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">to their voyage at the earliest opening of spring. Carolyn had gained</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">flesh and color as well as health, and strength and cheerfulness, and</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">was looking far better than she had looked since his first meeting her</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">again at Richmond. Mrs. Clifton repeated all this to Catherine, adding—</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“It is true, Kate, that none of her family who have perished by her</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">disease ever tried a change of climate, and although in most cases such</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">a change hurries the patient to the grave, yet, in some instances, it</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">seems to work wonders in the way of cure; and who knows, if Carolyn is</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">so greatly benefited, that she may not get over this danger, and if not</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">positively cured, yet live to a good old age, and die at last of</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">something else, as I have heard of consumptives doing.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“I’m so glad!” Catherine sat with her face suffused with the flush, and</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">her eyes filled with the tears of sympathizing joy and thanksgiving.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">After reading and re-reading the letter, and dwelling on it, and talking</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">of it, Mrs. Clifton finally unfolded the paper, the Richmond Standard,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">and running her eyes over its columns, suddenly exclaimed—</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Catherine, ‘When joys come they come not as single spies but in</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">battalions’—here is excellent news of an old friend—listen—only two or</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">three lines among the ‘items’ of a newspaper column, yet of what great</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">moment to many—hear.” And the lady read:—“At the conclusion of the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">recent treaty of peace between this government and the Shoshonowa</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Nation, among the prisoners held to ransom was the gallant Captain</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Fairfax, supposed to have fallen under their tomahawks, at the massacre</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">near Fort Protection. This brave but unfortunate officer is now</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">understood to be on his way to the seat of government.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Catherine was positively speechless with joy; only her clasped hands and</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">fervent countenance revealed what she felt. In the great, though calm</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">surprise and rejoicings over the event, these friends forgot its</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">singularity, until after a long while Catherine exclaimed—</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Poor Zuleime! Oh, how _could_ such a fatal misrepresentation have been</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">made of the case? It was reported that he was cloven down from his</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">saddle, and then butchered!”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“It was not a willful misrepresentation. It was a misapprehension. The</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">few who escaped to tell the tale of the massacre, no doubt had seen him</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">struck down; and don’t you see in the terror and confusion, they</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">imagined the rest—knowing perfectly well that scalping and rifling the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">bodies are the almost invariable custom of the savages? And then</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">remember, Catherine, the body taken for the corpse of Captain Fairfax,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">was so rifled and mutilated, as to be unrecognizable, except upon</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">circumstantial evidence.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“So indeed it was said to be! I would the mistake had never been made</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">though! It killed Zuleime!”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Catherine, my child, I have no idea that Zuleime was really drowned.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Madam!”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Do you not know, Catherine, that any body drowned in that part of the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">river where the supposed signs of her suicide were found, must have come</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">to light. Don’t you know that the current is very rapid there, and that</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">a ledge of rocks crosses the river a few yards below it, upon which her</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">body must have been thrown, if she had been in the river at all? And,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Catherine, if I have never breathed this thought before, it was upon</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">account of poor Carolyn. I knew that in her weak, depressed state of</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">mind and body, she could better bear the belief of Zuleime’s death, than</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">the frightful uncertainty of her fate. You are discreet, Kate; you will</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">not breathe this to Carolyn, or to any one, lest it should reach her</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">ear.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Never! And do you know, dear Mrs. Clifton, I have sometimes had the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">thought that Zuleime might yet be living—and I dared not indulge the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">hope secretly—much less breathe it aloud.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“And what was _your_ reason for such a supposition, Catherine?”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Why my thought was not so well founded—so logical as yours. I knew</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">nothing about the peculiarities of the river. My thought was only a</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">vague hope, and it agitated me so much as to interfere with my practical</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">duties. I had to banish it.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“You are so sensitive, so sympathetic, my dear girl. Well, Kate, no more</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">exciting talk to-night. We will return thanks to God for these glad</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">tidings, and then retire to rest.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>

<p class="p3"><span class="s2"><span class="Apple-converted-space">                             </span>CHAPTER XXIII.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2"><span class="Apple-converted-space">                                </span>ZULEIME.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2"><span class="Apple-converted-space">            </span>Among a jumbled heap of murky buildings.—KEATS.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Zuleime had been placed by Georgia under the care of a poor woman, the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">wife of a carver and gilder, who had occasionally worked for her father.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">And as long as the funds of the belle had held out, the trifling</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">expenses of such poor board and lodging had been regularly paid. But</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">when the syren was reduced to support her own extravagance entirely by</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">credit, founded upon the false reputation of wealth—her small</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">remittances to her protégé, or rather her victim, ceased. Zuleime was</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">afraid to seek her, afraid to write to her—there was nothing she feared</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">more than discovery, and the recognition of her hand-writing on the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">superscription of a letter might have led to that. It was long after the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">death of her father before she heard of it—nor then did she hear any of</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">the particulars of time, place or circumstance. The fact came to her</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">knowledge irregularly, through the report of the transcendant charms and</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">conquests of his beautiful young widow. A long and dangerous illness was</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">the result of this sudden news. It was some weeks after her recovery</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">before the poor people of the house, who had long despaired of getting</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">anything for her board, could find it in their kind hearts to ask her to</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">seek another home. And even then they sent a sigh after the desolate</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">young widow—the child who went forth carrying in her arms another child.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">And how she lived during the interval between that and the period at</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">which I shall again introduce her to you, I cannot tell. Sometimes a</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">little fine needle-work came to her hands; sometimes a spell of want,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">reaching almost to starvation; then a little assistance from neighbors;</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">and a little going in debt to shopkeepers. And then she always lodged</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">with the poor. And the poor seldom persecute the poor; remember that the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">needy family who first sheltered her, had been for months at the sole</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">expense of her food, lodging, and long illness—and yet they had never</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">reproached or persecuted her for unpaid debts—though they scarcely</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">refrained from reproaching themselves for sending her away.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">In a quiet, back street, mostly inhabited by very humble people, in the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">middle of the square, and fronting immediately upon the battered</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">pavement, stood an old two-story brick house, occupied by a poor</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">cabinet-maker and old furniture dealer. The lower front room was used as</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">the ware-room, and crowded and piled up with every description of</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">miserably dilapidated household furniture, apparently good for nothing</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">else under the sun but kindling wood, and scarcely worth splitting up</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">for that. Old worm-eaten, carved mahogany bureaus and bedsteads; tables</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">without legs or leaves; chairs without backs; cradles without bottoms or</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">rockers; clocks wanting faces; beaufets wanting doors; sofas minus arms;</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">smoky pictures without frames; and tarnished frames without pictures;</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">worm-eaten cabinets, and mildewed looking-glasses; broken pots, pans and</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">kettles; and mismatched crockery-ware in any quantity.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Reader, I do not wish to give you an inventory of an old furniture-shop,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">but merely some idea of the inextricable confusion in which this</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">heterogeneous mass of worn out, broken, worm-eaten, mildewed,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">fly-stained, dust-clothed, cobweb-veiled items, were piled up from floor</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">to ceiling. It would make your heart and head ache with wondering what</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">sort of a living could be picked out from so much dirt, disorder and</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">decay—and who on earth could be the patrons of the establishment. You</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">would unconsciously gather close about you your most worthless dress in</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">passing through the shop, and look up in involuntary dread of a broken</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">head or limbs, by the fall of some of those dilapidated, ill-balanced,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">old chairs and tables.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">The family of the chair-maker consisted of himself, his wife, and two</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">daughters. They were Germans, with the usual talent of that race for</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">money-getting and money-keeping. And the man made at least a hundred per</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">cent. on every old, rickety, worm-eaten bureau or table that, mended and</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">varnished, left his shop. They added to their income, by letting the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">rooms of their house, and occasionally by taking a profitable boarder.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">It was in the early part of the same autumn which found her sister</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Carolyn in Lisbon—and Mrs. Clifton and Catherine alone at Hardbargain,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">that Zuleime became a tenant of the German cabinet-maker. She occupied</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">the back room, on the second floor; the two daughters of the family</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">using the front room as a sleeping apartment. She had the use of the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">street passage door, and so reached her room without passing through the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">shop or any part of the house occupied by the family or their boarders.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">The refinement in which she had been born and bred, was not lost amid</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">her bitter poverty. It constrained her to seek privacy of life at least.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">She supported herself and child, just now, by doing fine needle-work for</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">some ladies on a transient visit to the city. But the work was</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">precarious, and the supply might be cut off at any moment. Her expenses</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">were small, however, and her economy wonderful. Her neat, but poorly</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">furnished room, cost her but ten shillings a month; a bushel of meal and</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">a pint of salt, five shillings; milk for the child, two shillings; fuel,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">eight shillings; washing, three shillings; candle-light, two shillings;</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">and the attendance of a boy to bring water and cut wood, three</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">shillings—making the sum total of her monthly expenses only one pound,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">fourteen shillings, or little more than six dollars. Her only food was</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">mush or corn-cakes prepared from the meal. She could not have kept up</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">very long under this regimen; indeed, although she knew it not, she was</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">slowly dying of a disease as common as lingering, and as universally</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">ignored as that of a broken heart—namely, innutrition or slow</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">starvation. Her German hostess, kind-hearted, notwithstanding her money</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">grasping propensities, often sent her a bowl of “noodle soup,” with a</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">little plate of “sour-krout,” and a tumbler of schnapps, or some such</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">combination of German luxuries. But Zuleime, who managed to exist upon</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">coarse food, could not endure gross food, and she would turn away from</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">such, scarcely able to conceal the sickness the very odor so appetizing</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">to a Dutch stomach, excited in hers. Still her refusal of the viands was</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">couched in words so gentle and grateful, as never to offend her</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">landlady. Some of my readers may wonder why Zuleime did not do her</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">washing, water-drawing, etc., with her own hands, and take the money</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">paid for having those things done, and buy better food? Because, for one</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">reason, she had not the requisite physical strength or skill—and</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">besides, perhaps, she shrank from the exposure necessarily incurred in</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">these labors. She had not in these two years, forgotten the delicacy and</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">refinement in which she had been nurtured. On the contrary, everything</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">in her appearance and manners, betrayed the gentle-woman. She had but</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">one dress in the world—all the others had been cut up to make clothes</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">for her little girl. Her sole gown was black bombazine, which she had</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">worn daily for nearly two years—yet so good was its original quality,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">and so well had it been preserved, that it was now neither rusty nor</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">threadbare. It was shaken out and hung up every night, and well brushed</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">and sponged every week. This dress, with the little inside ‘kerchief of</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">linen, was always neat and lady-like. Zuleime’s fine needle-work gave</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">out—as she knew it would—and she found herself without employment, or</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">funds. It was then that Bertha and Wilhelmina Erhmientraut, the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">daughters of her landlord, told her of a German clothier on Main street,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">who had advertised for a number of needle-women to make vests. Zuleime</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">confessed her total ignorance of that branch of needle-work. But the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">kind German girls promised that if she would procure the work, they</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">would give her some instructions how it should be done. Zuleime</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">gratefully accepted their offer, and prepared to set out on her long</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">walk by donning the little black bonnet and shawl, as neat and as well</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">preserved as her dress had been. She could not further tax the kindness</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">of her landlord’s family by leaving her child in their care, she had</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">been obliged to put the little one to sleep, and lock it up in her room,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">only leaving her key with her landlady—“in case anything should happen”</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">while she was gone. It was a long, weary tramp to Main street, where the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">clothier’s store was situated. When she entered the show-shop and made</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">her business known, she was directed into a back room, where a man,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">behind a long table, was engaged in cutting out garments—and many</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">bundles of cut out but unmade clothes, tied around with skeins of</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">thread, lay piled up at one end. Zuleime walked up to this table. The</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">foreman, as he appeared to be, laid down his shears and looked up,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">saying deferentially—</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“What did you wish to look at, madam? Mr. Schneider, attend this lady.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“You are in error. I do not wish to look at your wares. You advertised</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">work to give out; can I have some?”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">The tailor looked at her again. He saw, from her gentle manners and</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">appearance, that she was a lady, guessed from her dress that she was a</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">widow, and knew by her errand that she was self-dependent, unprotected;</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">so there existed no earthly reason why a coarse-minded, craven-hearted</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">man, who spent his whole days in smirking, cringing, deprecating and</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">deferring to others, should not refresh his soul by a little</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">impertinence and insolence to so safe a subject as a _poor lady_.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“And you ever make vests?” he asked, in a short, curt, insolent manner.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“No,” answered Zuleime, “but I sew very neatly—unusually neatly, my</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">patrons say—and as you cut and baste the work, very little instruction</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">would enable me to make them very nicely.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“I shan’t trust you! I have had quite enough in my time of giving out</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">work to people who know nothing about the business.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">It was not the words so much as the insulting manner of the man that</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">shocked the gentle-hearted woman, and she turned and left the shop,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">ready to sink, not so much under disappointment, though she knew not</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">where to turn for work or money or food—but under the deeply humiliating</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">sense of the rudeness and vulgarity to which she was forced to expose</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">herself in this bitter struggle through the world. She walked slowly,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">thoughtfully, sadly away from the shop, till the sudden thought of her</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">child’s awakening, electrified her, and she hurried on until she reached</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">home. She obtained her key from the landlady, in the basement, and</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">entered the passage. It was then that she heard a very sweet, gentle</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">voice, apparently near her room door, saying—</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Don’t cry, baby! _poor_ baby, don’t cry! mother will come by-and-by!</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">_Dear pretty_ baby, don’t cry! I’ll bring you all my playthings, and a</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">little dog, when I can get in.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">And then, in the pause of the child’s wails and broken talk, and baby</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">plaints, she ran up stairs at once, and there, kneeling before her door,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">and talking through the key-hole, was a sweet little dark haired girl of</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">about five years old, and dressed in deep mourning. Her hat of the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">finest Leghorn straw, the richness of the black ribbon that bound it—the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">fineness of the black bombazine frock and the linen cambric tucker, the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">delicate shoes and stockings—the gentle, refined manner, all bespoke a</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">child of a different rank from those seen in that neighborhood, and</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">especially in that house. The child got up and stood aside when she saw</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">the lady come with the key to unlock the door. When Zuleime had entered</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">her room, and lifted the babe to her lap, she called the little girl up</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">to her side. She was a lovely child indeed, with fair skin and delicate</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">features—jet black hair, eyebrows and eyelashes, and large, mournful,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">dark gray eyes.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“You are a dear little girl. What is your name? asked Zuleime, pulling</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">her around her waist caressingly.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Ida ——; see what a nice new black dress I’ve got. They gave it to me</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">when father died. Mother wears one, too. You’ve got a black dress on,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">too! Is your father dead?”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Yes, darling,” said Zuleime, with her eyes suffused.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Don’t cry, please! Mother cries so much. I do wish she wouldn’t! Is the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">baby’s father dead, too?”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Yes—yes, love—the baby’s father is dead, too!”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Well—_please_ don’t cry so! Mother says we have all got a father in</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Heaven! _Oh! please_ don’t cry so! It gives me such a—such an ache in</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">the breast to see anybody cry so,” said the child, and her mournful, but</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">most beautiful eyes assumed a pleading, painful, almost _querulous_</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">look.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Who _is_ your mother, sweet Ida?” asked Zuleime, to change the subject</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">of her own and her little companion’s thoughts.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Mrs. Knight, you know, the leading lady. Did they put the baby’s father</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">in a long red box, and send him away?”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Yes, yes, Ida. Where does your mother live?”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“She lives here, in the back room, down stairs. We came to-day. She is</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">going to play to-night, and then I’ll be by myself. Did they hold the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">baby up to kiss her father like they did me? And did he put his hand on</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">her head and call her his fawn-eyed darling? That was when he was on the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">bed. And afterwards he went to sleep. And they said he was dead. Was</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">that the way with the baby’s father?”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“I don’t want to talk about it, dear Ida. Tell me of your mother. What</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">does she play on—the organ?”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“No! I don’t know. Yes I do, too!—the stage. Look at my nice new hat. It</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">used to have a wreath of red roses round it. But when father died,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">mother took it off and put this black ribbon there. Mother wears roses</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">on her head, though. At night, I mean. All day long she wears black, and</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">looks so pale and weeps. But at night, she puts beautiful flowers in her</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">hair, and sometimes gold and fine feathers—and she has such sweet long</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">curls and rosy cheeks—and such beautiful dresses. And father used to</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">wear beautiful clothes at night, red and gold, and feathers. I do want</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">to see father so much. I wish they’d bring him back. Do you think it</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">will be long before I see him?” asked the child, as the large tears</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">rolled down her cheeks.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Perhaps not, my love. Is your mother an actress, then?”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Yes, that is what she is. Don’t cry, now! It gives me a pain in my</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">bosom. _Please_ don’t cry; if _you_ don’t, _I_ won’t,” said the child,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">wiping her eyes. Then suddenly she exclaimed, “Oh! I forgot, I promised</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">to bring the baby my playthings and my curly dog”; and so saying, the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">child ran away and scampered down stairs.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Zuleime looked in vain for her return, and finally concluded that her</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">mother had detained her. But if the child did not come, somebody else</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">did. Wilhelmina entered, and kindly inquired after her lodger’s success</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">in seeking work. When she learned her failure, she begged Zuleime not to</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">be troubled, for that there was work in the house for her if she would</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">take it. That the new boarder, Mrs. Knight, the leading lady of the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Richmond Theatre, wanted assistance in making up some dresses, that were</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">to be ready in a few days. That she, Wilhelmina, had recommended their</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">lodger, and if the young lady pleased, she would conduct her down and</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">introduce her to Mrs. Knight. Zuleime thanked the kind-hearted girl, and</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">prepared to accompany her—sensible amid all her other emotions of a</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">rustic’s curiosity to see a really living actress, for she had never in</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">her life seen one off the boards. She followed Wilhelmina down the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">stairs into the passage. Near the foot of the stairs was a door leading</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">into the first floor back room. At this door Wilhelmina rapped. It was</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">opened by Ida, who, as soon as she saw Zuleime, exclaimed—</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Oh! it’s you! Come in. Mother! here is the baby’s mother!”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“It is I, Mrs. Knight, with the person I spoke of. May we come in?”</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">inquired Wilhelmina.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Assuredly. Do so,” replied the sweetest, deepest voice Zuleime thought</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">she had ever heard. And they entered the room. Wilhelmina introduced</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Mrs. Fairfax, and withdrew. The apartment in which Zuleime found</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">herself, was the best furnished room in the house—decidedly—having a</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">good warm, hued carpet on the floor, crimson stuff curtains at the only</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">back window, a grate with a coal fire, a four-post bedstead, with</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">tester, net valance and a white counterpane, a bureau with tall</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">dressing-glass, and wash-stand, with china toilet service. But it was in</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">a state of confusion only less than that of the adjoining shop. Trunks,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">boxes, and band boxes of all sizes, forms and colors, some corded and</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">piled up one above the other, and some open and boiling up and over with</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">all sorts of finery and tinsel, satins, silks and velvets, feathers,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">flowers and fustian, which also trailed upon the carpet, and strewed the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">chairs. An oil painting, in a large heavy gilt frame, leaned with its</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">face against the wall. On the bed, a black mantle and bonnet, with a</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">widow’s veil, lay side by side with a gorgeous scarlet velvet train,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">embroidered with gold, an imitation ermine robe, a crown of gilt and</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">paste, a plume of feathers, and great bunches of sham pearls. On a low</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">trunk, in the midst of this sad chaos of poverty and glitter, mummery</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">and mourning, sat one who immediately drew and fixed Zuleime’s</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">attention. A tall, noble looking woman, of perhaps thirty years of age,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">clothed in deep mourning, with her heavy black hair banded around her</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">forehead and temples, and shading a countenance dark and cavernous, with</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">its large hollow eyes and hollow cheeks, but majestic with power,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">earnestness and truth, and beautiful with those grand, mournful eyes,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">whose mesmeric spell was felt by Zuleime, on whom they were now brought</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">to bear.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Take a seat, Mrs. Fairfax. You find me here in great confusion, because</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">I have but just arrived, and have had to unpack and look over all these</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">trunks, to select and prepare no less than four costumes for the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">evening,” said the same rich, full, deep tones, as their owner cleared a</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">chair of spangled robes and plumes, and offered it to her visitor.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Mother is going to wear _this_ dress this evening—isn’t it pretty?”</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">said Ida, climbing upon the foot of the bed.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Zuleime turned her eyes with childish interest towards the robes; and</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Mrs. Knight, observing her look of curiosity, said—</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“They form a portion of the Queen Katherine costume. They are going to</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">bring out Henry VIII., this evening.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Zuleime glanced from the costume to the haggard, but noble looking</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">woman, and thought that she might represent the unhappy Queen very well,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">as far as personal appearance would go, but instead of expressing this</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">opinion, she said—</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“The young German girl told me that you wanted some assistance in</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">needle-work. I shall be glad to help you.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">The dark, mournful eyes rose slowly, and grew still, looking at the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">young widow, in whom they now began to recognize that most piteous of</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">all beings—_a reduced lady_.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Sit down—pray sit down,” she said, to Zuleime, who still remained</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">standing.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Zuleime took the vacant chair.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Would you object, Mrs. Fairfax, to sitting with me while you sew? There</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">are alterations to be made in these four Queen Katherine dresses, in</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">which you would require my advice.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Zuleime hesitated, and then answered—</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“I should not like to leave my little child alone, madam.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Let me!—let me!—let me go up and stay with the baby!” eagerly</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">interrupted Ida, jumping down from the bed, and running up and seizing</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">the hand of her mother.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">The dark eyes sank fondly on the little one, and the rich voice—richer</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">now with maternal love, replied—</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Certainly you may go, if the lady will permit you to do so.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Zuleime hesitated again, then said—</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Thank you. I shall be very glad. Let me go up first, and make the fire</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">safe.” And she left the room, followed by Ida, who ran back first, to</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">throw her arms around her mother’s neck, and kiss her “good-bye.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">When Zuleime reached her room, she placed the blower before the grate,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">for safety—hid away all implements with which the children might harm</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">themselves, and leaving the little ones at play upon the rag carpet,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">returned below stairs, and went to work. Her new occupation was indeed</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">of an odd and miscellaneous description—ripping off gold lace, and</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">sewing in its place imitation sable; trimming buskins, and lastly,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">making up an ancient coiffure, all under the direction of the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">shadowy-faced woman, who, all this time, sat upon the trunk, with a</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">tattered play-book on her knee, studying her part.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Zuleime spoke of Ida—her beauty, her charming manner.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Is she? Do you find her so? I thought that might be only my partiality.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Poor little one! She is a great comfort and a great sorrow to me, if you</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">can understand such a paradox.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Yes, I can understand it,” said Zuleime.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“I have to leave her all the forenoon, for the purpose of attending the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">rehearsals, and then, before it is time for her to go to bed, I have to</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">leave her, alone, and go to the theatre, and be absent till a late hour</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">of the night. And then the fear of fire, or of accident, while I am gone</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">from her, wears me out. Worse than that, all day and night, while away</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">from her, is the dread of her getting in the street, and into evil</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">company.” And the eyes of the woman assumed an anxious, haggard,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">querulous look, as she dropped them upon her book.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Give your little girl into my care. I am never absent from home except</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">early in the morning—as to-day—and at that hour you are here.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">The dark eyes flew up and fastened themselves upon the face of Zuleime,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">and the deep voice inquired—</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Would you really take charge of her for me? Oh, it is too much for you,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">and too good in you. I don’t understand it.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Indeed I shall be very glad to do so. The presence of a lovely child is</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">a great pleasure to me. Leave Ida with me this evening while you are</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">gone, and I will put her to bed when the time comes.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“For this evening I will gratefully accept your kindness, but you may</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">find her more inconvenient than you anticipate,” said Mrs. Knight. And</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">then she dropped her eyes again upon her book, and Zuleime went on</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">silently with her sewing. About sunset the work was nearly completed,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">and the costume, with the exception of the coiffure, upon which Zuleime</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">was still engaged, was packed in bandboxes, to be conveyed to the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">theatre. Then Mrs. Knight rang a little hand bell, and when it was</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">answered by the entrance of Bertha Erhmientraut, she said,—“Please send</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">me a lad to carry these boxes for me, and ask your mother to make me a</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">very strong cup of coffee.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Bertha disappeared, and Mrs. Knight put on her bonnet and shawl. And</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">soon a ragged boy appeared at the door, who agreed to carry the boxes</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">for a sixpence. Mrs. Knight loaded and dispatched him at the same moment</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">that Bertha re-appeared with a huge cup of strong coffee, which she took</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">and drank off, standing. Then, as she handed back the empty cup to the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">German girl, and received from Zuleime the finished coiffure pinned up</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">in a paper, she said—</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“That cup of coffee will give me strength to go through my heavy part</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">to-night, but will leave me at its close more exhausted than ever; thus</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">I discount future health and life for present bread.” And so she went</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">off, her eyes gleaming under the excitement of a stimulant narcotic, as</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">fatal, if not as disreputable, as opium or alcohol. Zuleime went up to</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">her own room, and prepared the frugal supper for herself and the two</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">children, that were still playing on the carpet. She got a double</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">portion of milk from the German people, on account of her little guest,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Ida declaring that she liked milk with corn cake crumbled in it better</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">than anything, it was so sweet. And then when the babe was undressed and</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">put to bed, the little girl’s eyes waxed heavy and dim, and Zuleime took</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">her down stairs into her mother’s room, and disrobed and washed and</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">prepared her for bed. And when the child was about to kiss her friend</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">and spring into bed, Zuleime said—</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Stop, Ida. Don’t you say your prayers?”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“No, ma’am.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“But don’t you wish to?”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Oh, yes, ma’am,” said the child, and running back, she kneeled down at</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Zuleime’s knees, and placed her little hands together and looked up for</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">instruction.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Zuleime thought the shortest, simplest infant’s prayer she knew of was</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">the best, because readily understood and easily remembered. And so she</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">took the little one’s folded hands between her own, and bade her repeat</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">after her—</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2"><span class="Apple-converted-space">                   </span>“Now I lay me down to sleep,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2"><span class="Apple-converted-space">                   </span>I pray the Lord my soul to keep.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2"><span class="Apple-converted-space">                   </span>If I should die before I wake,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2"><span class="Apple-converted-space">                   </span>I pray the Lord my soul to take.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“That is a sweet little verse. What _is_ my soul?” asked the child.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Zuleime hesitated, puzzled for an answer; then she said for want of a</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">better—</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“It is what you think with, and wonder with, and what you are sorry or</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">glad with, and what will live forever.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“I love you with it then. Good-night, good, pretty lady.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Good-night, sweet child.” And Zuleime laid her in the bed, and kissed</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">her fair eyelids down to slumber.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>

<p class="p3"><span class="s2"><span class="Apple-converted-space">                            </span>THE CATASTROPHE.</span></p>

<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Heaven knows that it is now difficult enough for a poor woman to make a</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">living. But in the days when Zuleime lived and suffered, it was even</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">more so. It was especially hard in Virginia, where, owing to the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">prevalence of the law of entail, the rich were very rich, and the poor</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">very poor. Where, besides, ladies took pride in their domestic and</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">industrious habits, the favorite and most inveterate of which was that</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">of doing their own sewing, forgetful of the poor widow and orphan, who</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">might be suffering for the want of the work. It was for such reasons</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">that Zuleime found little or no employment—at most of the houses where</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">she applied she was told that—“We never give out needle-work,” or that,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“The ladies of the house do all the family sewing.” All very well, in</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">moderation. Industry is a praiseworthy habit, when it does not</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">compromise justice and mercy—when it does not hinder us to “live and let</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">live.” Let us be different in our several callings; but for Heaven’s</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">sake, if we can possibly afford it, let us never refuse to give work to</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">those who need, or who ask it of us. They may be suffering for it, they</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">may be starving for it, they may be dying for it, as Zuleime was. They</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">may be driven to vice, to crime, for the want of it, as Zuleime was not,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">thank Heaven. Reader, this portion of my story at least is no fiction.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Nor was Zuleime’s case _then_ a solitary one. Nor would it be such</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">_now_. There are many poor women, in every city, who have not work</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">enough to earn their necessary food and fuel. And this is one of the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">causes:—There are hundreds of ladies, of the middle classes of society,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">who work themselves nearly to death, and really shorten their lives, by</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">sewing for their large families, in order to save money to lay out in</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">dress for themselves and children, more genteel than needful; or in</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">furniture, which they do not live very long to enjoy. And all this time</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">there are hundreds of poor women around them suffering for a part of</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">this very work with which _they_ are killing themselves. Yes, hundreds</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">who die annually of innutrition—a slow, cruelly slow starvation,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">prolonged from month to month, or from year to year, according to their</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">relative strength of constitution. I know it. For I have lived among</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">them, and seen for myself, and not another. The doctors call the want,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">of which they die, consumption—I think it is rather _non_-consumption.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Zuleime sank deeper and deeper into penury. As autumn advanced into</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">winter, and as her necessities increased, her ability to supply them</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">decreased. Her poverty began to betray itself sadly in her personal</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">appearance. Her face was thin and wan, with great, bright, hungry</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">looking eyes—her hands wasted to semi-transparency. Her only gown, her</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">black bombazine, was rusty and threadbare, and embossed with darns—her</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">shoes were so bad as to look scarcely decent. And amid all her other</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">troubles, there was room for humiliated feelings upon even this account.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">The present was wretched—the future hopeless. She had heard of people</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">perishing from cold and hunger, and to such an end she thought her life</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">seemed tending. Yet miserable as was the condition of Zuleime, there</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">were many then, are many now, in much worse situations. She at least was</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">starving in a tolerably clean room, in privacy and in peace. Far happier</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">than some who perish in the midst of vice and filth and squalor. Yes,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">reader, there are such things; they _do_ exist in my neighborhood, and</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">yours, and it is just as well that they should sometimes be remembered.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Zuleime was dying of want. And did the people of the house know nothing</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">of this? Yes, they knew something of it, and her German landlord</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">trembled for his rent, his wife wished that they had never seen the poor</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">thing, and the two girls pitied her very deeply. And Mrs. Knight saw it</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">all, and suffered in sympathy, and gave the poor, dying girl, all the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">work she had to give, and paid her for doing it as liberally as she</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">could afford. But Mrs. Knight was not able, from her scanty salary, to</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">keep up her expensive, professional wardrobe, and support two families</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">besides. The greater part of the money Zuleime made, by sewing for the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">poor actress, was paid for rent, to keep the roof over her head that</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">bitter weather, and to supply the daily two pence worth of milk for the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">child. If a few pence were left over, they were spent in cheap pilot</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">bread, sparingly eaten by herself. For weeks together she had no fire,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">no fuel, but would manage to keep her child warm by seating her in the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">middle of the bed, well wrapped up. By the side of the head of the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">bedstead, and looking to the south, was the only back window of her</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">room. When she had work, she would sit by this window and sew, while her</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">child sat wrapped up in the bed. When she had no work, she would still</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">sit there and rock her child upon her bosom, singing to her all the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">while. Unearthly and spiritual was the wan, moonlight face, with its</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">large, luminous eyes—unearthly and spiritual was the voice in which she</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">sang her child to rest, as she sat by the south window. She found room</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">in her burdened heart to love that sunny window, with its glimpses of a</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">river landscape, with waterfalls and hills and forests, and nearer,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">lying between her and the water, the pleasure-grounds around a fair</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">mansion of white freestone, that fronted on the river. That fine place</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">took in nearly a whole square, and was separated from this poor house</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">and lot, first, by a broad, back alley, then a tall brick wall, with</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">capacious stables and coach-houses, then the garden, with terraces and</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">conservatory, and so up to the Venetian back piazza of the mansion.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Every day, and all day long through the glowing autumn weather, she had</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">sat and feasted her eyes and mind upon these pleasure-grounds, with</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">their gorgeous flowers and magnificent trees, and the palace-home in the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">midst, a picture of beauty and glory, telling besides of plenty,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">elegance, refinement, leisure, artistic taste, intellectual pursuits,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">family union, domestic happiness. Many a time, when going out to look</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">for work, she had walked quite around the square to get in front of the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">mansion, and satisfy her soul with the architectural beauty and elegance</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">of the edifice, as it stood elevated by a flight of terraces far above</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">the street, and commanding for many miles the mighty course of the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">river. Often in the autumn weather, had she walked under this southern</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">wall, and even in the midst of her deep distresses, looked up in</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">childish longing at the splendid autumnal flowers, trailing luxuriantly</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">over the iron railing. Why did this place interest her so? Not because</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">it was a palace-home, in such strong contrast to her own poor</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">dwelling—not because she passed it almost every day—not because its</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">magnificent grounds were ever before her sight from her own poor room.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Ah, no! But because there was a rural character, and a fine, old,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">ancestral look about the place, that reminded her of her dear, lost</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">home. Everything connected with the premises interested her, even that</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">capacious family carriage, with its round bodied, gray coach horses, and</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">its fat coachman, which appeared every afternoon at a certain hour to</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">take the family out to drive. She did not care to inquire who lived</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">there. One day, when walking in front of the house on the other street,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">she had seen a lady in deep mourning come out and get in the carriage.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">She had time to see that the lady appeared bowed in grief, but possessed</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">so sweet and benevolent a face, that she was encouraged to call and ask</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">for work. So the next day she entered the beautiful grounds, and</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">ascended the stone steps that led flight by flight up the rising</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">terraces until she reached the Grecian portico and rang the bell. The</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">door was opened by a man servant, to whom she communicated her business.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">He called a waiting-woman, who came, and after hearing what the visitor</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">wanted, explained civilly enough that all their needle-work was done by</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">a young person, who lived companion to her mistress, who was too infirm</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">to see strangers. Zuleime never tried there again. But the sweet,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">sorrowful face of the lady haunted her, and she gazed from her poor</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">window upon the magnificent pleasure-grounds with more of interest than</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">ever.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Truly the world _is_ “full of paper walls.” How little Zuleime surmised</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">that the mourner in the palace sorrowed over the very same bereavement</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">that had laid her own life waste—that the fair-haired, tender-eyed lady,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">whose grief-worn countenance haunted her so, was the mother of her lost</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Frank; that the proud mansion-house, in the midst of its</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">pleasure-grounds, was the rightful inheritance of the poor babe that</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">rested on her wasted bosom.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">How little did the childless and desolate recluse of the palace guess</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">that her lost son’s widow sat pining, starving so near her! The world is</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">full of paper walls, but fate makes them firmer, stronger, more</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">indestructible than adamant.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Upon that very same December night that found Mrs. Clifton and Catherine</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">rejoicing over the good news they had heard from their friends, upon</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">that very night Zuleime sat shivering in her room, without fire, food or</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">light. She had given her child its cup of milk, and thanked Heaven that</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">she had it to give, though she herself went hungry. And she had wrapped</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">the babe in her shawl, and sat by the window, singing and rocking her to</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">sleep. The room was intensely cold, she was chilled to the heart, her</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">feet were numb, and almost lifeless. The only warmth in her body seemed</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">to be the bosom at which the child was pressed. The snow was falling</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">fast without, but even through its flakes she saw the lighted windows of</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">the mansion-house glowing through the crimson curtains, and streaming</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">redly across the snow-clad ground. And she sat and thought of the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">comforts within that parlor. While she sat there thinking, there came a</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">gentle knock at her door.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Who is there?” inquired Zuleime.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“It is I, Mrs. Fairfax,” replied the voice of the actress.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Come in, Mrs. Knight.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">The actress entered, saying, with a little pardonable tact—</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Oh, you are putting your child to sleep in the dark. It is singular</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">some little ones never will go to sleep where there is a light burning.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">_Is_ she asleep?”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Yes,” replied Zuleime.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Then please put her in bed, my dear, and come down stairs with me. I</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">have something to talk to you about.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Zuleime laid her little girl in bed, and tottering with weakness, from</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">her long fast and the cold, accompanied the actress down stairs.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Mrs. Knight opened her own room, and revealed a warm coal fire burning</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">in the grate, and a little supper-table set out, with coffee, French</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">rolls, nice butter, and stewed oysters. She set the cushioned</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">rocking-chair for Zuleime, between the fire and the table, and pushed</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">her gently into the seat, saying—</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“I have holyday to-night, and for a week from to-night, because the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">opera troupe are here. And so I thought I would just celebrate its</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">commencement by a supper and a ball for two!” And she placed before her</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">visitor a plate of oysters and a cup of coffee. When the little supper</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">was fairly commenced, Mrs. Knight said, “I did not send for you, only to</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">take coffee with me—I wished to speak to you on a matter of business. I</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">have been wishing some time to do so, but scarcely knew how to do it</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">without wounding or offending you.” She paused.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Ah! are you so considerate? Yet you need not fear—I know _you_ could</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">not think of anything to say which would—</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“At least, I only mean your good, and if I err, you will forgive me.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Gentle friend! I am used to all the hardness and vulgarity against</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">which a woman has to break her heart and spirit, in struggling through</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">the rough world. Now think of that. And think whether I can be hurt by</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">anything your kind heart impels you to say. No, I shall be very</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">grateful!”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Well, this is it, then, my dear. I have not been able to avoid seeing</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">your fruitless efforts to maintain yourself and child, for the last</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">three months. I fear you have scarcely made five shillings a week.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“I have not made that for the last month.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“And there seems to be no chance of doing better—with your needle, I</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">mean.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Ah, no, no.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“And your situation is getting worse every day. Poor child! your very</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">shoes are almost gone—there—forgive me—I have spoken rudely.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“No, no—you have spoken the truth in love. Any truth can be told in the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">spirit of love.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“And you are wasting away—you will be thrown upon your sick bed—then</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">what will become of your child?”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Alas, God knows! If we both could die—”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Yes, if you both _could_. Death is no evil at all.” As the actress said</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">this, her hollow, shadowy face grew dark, and her large, luminous eyes</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">glanced aside, and fell upon the door—fixed in an intense, suffering,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">almost querulous gaze—as if of one enduring pain. “It must come abruptly</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">at last,” she said, looking up, suddenly. “My dear, have you any</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">insurmountable prejudices against a theatrical life for yourself?”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Startled by the abruptness of the proposition, Zuleime raised her eyes</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">to the beautiful, dark, irritated countenance before her, without</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">replying.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“You don’t understand me. Well, then, to put it plainer, if nothing</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">better at all could be found for you, would you absolutely refuse to go</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">upon the stage?”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Zuleime had understood her very well, and if she still hesitated, it was</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">from a reluctance to wound the spirit of the actress.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Do you, then, consider the histrionic profession disreputable?” asked</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Mrs. Knight, with the same suffering, querulous, almost cross expression</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">of the eyes.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“No,” said Zuleime, very gently, “I do not. Not the profession that Mrs.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Siddons ennobled. I think it truly</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2"><span class="Apple-converted-space">                   </span>“‘The youngest of the sister arts,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2"><span class="Apple-converted-space">                   </span>Where all their beauties blend.’”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Well, then, my question—Would you object to going on the stage</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">yourself?”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“I am not fit for it,” replied Zuleime, evasively.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“I do not know that. I need not tell you that you are young and pretty,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">and singularly graceful—nor that you have a very fine voice for</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">singing—these form a very good foundation. And in elocution, my dear, I</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">would myself become your instructress. What say you?”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“That you are kinder to me than any one has ever been since I left home;</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">and that I am very, very grateful,” Zuleime said, very gently.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“But that you despise the calling too thoroughly to follow it, even for</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">bread,” said the actress, bitterly.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“No, no—I did not say or mean that, indeed—but I, you see, have neither</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">the taste, talent, nor courage requisite!”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Why not?”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“I was brought up in the privacy of domestic life; in the deep seclusion</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">of the country. I have never been used to _society_, much less to</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">_publicity_, and I am sure, that no matter how well I might be</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">instructed in my part, when I should come before an audience, I should</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">forget all about it, and half die of shame.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Ah, I suppose you have no vocation for it. An actress forgets her own</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">identity in that of the character she represents, and that enables her</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">to go through things she could not otherwise endure. But, my dear, I do</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">not see anything else you can do; and as for the ‘stage fright,’ as it</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">is called among us, you would soon get that off.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Zuleime shook her head.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“My dear, you do not yet know the plan I have for you. I never</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">thought—no one would ever think of a sudden grand debut for _you_.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Nothing but great genius, strong vocation, and perfect self-possession</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">on the part of the _debutante_, would justify such a thing. No—the art</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">must be acquired, as other arts are—slowly. This is the plan I had for</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">you, and it entirely precludes the possibility of a stage fright, since</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">you are gradually inured to it. Do you understand me, now?”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“No, I do not!”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Well, then, for instance—and to come to the point! The opera season is</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">about to commence, and the manager wishes to engage about half a dozen</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">young girls as chorus singers. Will you be one? The lowest salary they</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">ever give a chorus singer is six dollars a week—that is four times as</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">much as you ever earned by the tedious needle. Will you consent?”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Still Zuleime was silent.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“After the opera season is over, I make no doubt that your youth, beauty</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">and grace, and your very fine voice, will secure you a permanent</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">engagement at an advanced salary. Will you go with me to the manager</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">to-morrow?”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“No,” said Zuleime, “I should not dare to go upon the stage. I could not</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">face an audience.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“And you need not face them! You would be in a group of young girls, and</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">no one would notice you, except casually as a part of the scenery. The</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">attention of the audience is taken up with the principal performers.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Besides, no one will know who you are. Your name need not appear upon</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">the bills. I will take every care of your feelings, if, indeed, you can</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">be sensible of them when hunger and cold are felt.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“I do not like the life,” said Zuleime. “I had almost as willingly</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">starve.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">The actress arose and rung the bell.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Oh! it is nothing to me, Mrs. Fairfax. Do as you please. I have no</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">earthly interest to serve in persuading you to this step,” she said,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">with the old, cross, querulous look on her haggard face, and in her</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">beautiful dark, gray eyes.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Bertha came in and cleared away the table.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Mrs. Knight walked up and down the room in a hasty. irritated manner.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“I wish I was at work again! I am sick of my holyday already! Since I</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">cannot afford to abandon this hateful art, I wish I were always delving</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">at it, and there came no pause for self-recollection. I wish I were</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">perpetually Queen Katherine, Mrs. Haller, Isabella, Imogene, Lady</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Macbeth, Bianca Fazio, and the others, going incessantly through the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">circle like the earth through the signs of the zodiac. I wish I were</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">always somebody else, anybody else than poor Ida Knight.” And she threw</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">herself into a chair, glancing at Zuleime with a strained, appealing,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">accusing look. But the wan face of the dying girl, with its hectic</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">flush, smote the rock in her heart, and she moved to her side and took</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">her hand and said, gently, though with the same tone and look of</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">querulous suffering. “It _is_ a wretched life! I feel it so—only it is</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">not so bad as starving, and seeing your child starve. My dear, it _is_</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">something to me whether I persuade you to do this thing or not. I cannot</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">bear to see you suffer so. Your necessities weigh upon my heart in</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">addition to my own. And really,” she added, with the same frowning,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">irritated look, “really, I have such a burden of my own, that I grow</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">restive under a feather of anybody else’s.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Then do not take my sorrows on your shoulders, dear lady; I can bear</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">them myself, or die under their weight uncomplainingly. Do not take my</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">troubles to heart!” said Zuleime, gently.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">The actress looked up with a sharp, rebuking glance, saying—</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“As if I could help it! You are not sincere when you ask me to do so!</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">No, the only way I can get your griefs off my heart is to get them off</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">your own. I must get you into _living_ circumstances. I must persuade</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">you to go on the stage with me. It is not a pleasant profession for a</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">lady, I grant you—neither is freezing or starving, and getting into debt</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">and being dunned and rebuffed, pleasant—but—” she added, with a look of</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">almost fierce self-assertion and self-defence—“neither is it actually</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">_sinful_, that I know of. It necessarily transgresses no command of God</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">with which I am acquainted. One need not be a heathen because she is an</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">actress. Mrs. Siddons was a member in full communion with the Church of</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">England. The stage has its dangers, I grant you, but you may safely pass</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">through them, if you please. I have done so! I was not born or brought</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">up to that life, my dear; I was the daughter of an English country</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">curate—then a nursery governess—then a traveling companion to an earl’s</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">daughter—then I accidentally met with my husband, and we married from</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">mutual affection. He was a tragedian—that is the way in which I became</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">an actress. Now I follow the histrionic profession as the only means of</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">living left open to me. I have seen the dangers—nay, I have _felt_ them.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">But nightly—no matter how utterly wearied out with toil I may have been,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">I have uttered two lines of sincere prayer, that God would keep me from</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">falling into deeper sin. And He has kept me! Does that surprise you? God</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">is the God of the publican as well as of the Pharisee. Who dares</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">excommunicate me? What child of the Universal Father shall dare to say</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">that another is excluded from His love and care and protection? Verily,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">the day of Judgment will be a day of startling revelations. And many</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">that are first shall be last, and the last shall be first.” And then the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">actress fell into silence, and her fine countenance lost that look of</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">captious self-defence, and settled into meditative earnestness.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Zuleime arose to go. Mrs. Knight took her hand, and said, gently—</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“My dear, think over what I have proposed to you. If you decide to</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">accept my proposition, I will take every possible care of you. You shall</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">be as my own daughter. I will shield you from all dangers. I will</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">instruct you in your art. And I will give you the freedom of my</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">wardrobe. Good-night. Will you kiss me?”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">And she drew Zuleime to her bosom. The poor girl pressed her lips to</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">those of the actress, and slipping through the door, passed up in the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">dark and cold to her own room.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Ida went to bed, but the poor, generous, irritable woman could not sleep</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">for sympathy, for anxiety, and for the sound of Zuleime’s racking cough.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“She will never be able to sing much, I am really afraid. But she shall</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">be paid well for dressing, and for making her beautiful face and form a</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">part of the pageantry—that I am determined upon, if I have any influence</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">with the management,” thought Ida, as she sank to sleep.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Rusty and threadbare clothing, broken shoes, cold, hunger, and a</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">suffering child, are forcible arguments, and they seconded the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">persuasions of Ida with tremendous power.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Zuleime yielded, and was carried down the current of fate as easily,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">with as little resistance as the sapling beaten down by the rain,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">uprooted by the wind, and carried off by the flood, is whirled down the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">stream.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">It was the fatal night of the 26th of December, 1811, the night of the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">burning of the Richmond Theatre, a night ever to be remembered in the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">annals of that city, and ever to be mourned in the hearts of her</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">citizens. That evening more than six hundred lovers of pleasure were</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">gayly preparing for the theatre; not dreaming, alas! that they also were</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">doomed to take fearful part in an awful tragedy—a tragedy unprecedented</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">in the history of the stage. Before eight o’clock, more than six hundred</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">persons, from pleasant city homes all around, assembled in the fated</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">building; before twelve o’clock, more than one hundred had perished</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">horribly in the flames! and the scarcely surviving five hundred, many</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">wounded, maimed, or burned, all despairingly mourning the awful fate of</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">nearest relatives and friends, returned or were borne back to their</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">desolate homes!</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">That afternoon, unprophetic of doom as any of the others, Zuleime and</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">her friend were preparing to go on the stage. Zuleime had no part to</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">perform—she was as yet only an attaché—and was to appear but in one</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">scene, as one of a group of villagers. She was engaged in fixing up a</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">peasant dress, consisting of a straw hat, black spencer, short gray</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">skirt, and striped stockings. Mrs. Knight was, as usual, doing two</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">things at once—arranging her costume and studying her part. But the eyes</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">of Ida often wandered towards Zuleime, as she heard that hacking,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">racking cough, and she noticed with pain the waning face. Yes! within a</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">few days even, the thin face had become perceptibly thinner, and the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">flushed cheek burned with a darker crimson. “And she will make a sorry</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">looking peasant,” thought Ida; “a very sorry peasant, with that</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">delicate, spiritual, almost ærial face and form of hers. How absurdly</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">inappropriate are most of the affairs we get up! Truly, our art is in</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">the rear of all others. Now, this evening, all go on as villagers—vulgar</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">and refined—all reduced to one level. Those coarse, brawny Miss</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Butchers, and this fragile, delicate Zuleime, all peasants—very well for</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">the Miss Butchers, but for Zuleime! To-morrow evening all go on as</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">faries; excellent well for this ærial Zuleime, but for the Miss</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Butchers! Well, our notions are fanciful as arbitrary—and there may be</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">peasants who have delicate, white, semi-transparent fingers, and there</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">may be faries with large, flat feet, and great red hands, for aught we</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">know.” While Mrs. Knight silently cogitated, and covered her white satin</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">shoes anew, and studied her part, Zuleime worked on also in silence, but</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">too despairing, too exhausted, even to think of the wayward fate which</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">had brought her to this pass.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">At about sunset their preparations were completed. Ida, as usual, rang</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">for her cup of coffee and her errand boy, and packed up and sent away</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">the costume for the evening. Then she put her own little girl and</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Zuleime’s child to sleep together in her bed, and got Bertha to promise</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">to look in, in the course of the evening, and see that all was safe. And</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">then poor Ida carefully wrapped Zuleime up in her own mantilla, and</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">wound her own furs around her neck, saying, in answer to all</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">expostulation—</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Never mind _me_, my dear! I’ve got no cough. Haggard as I look, I’m</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">whit-leather! _You_ must take care of your poor little self.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">And then they left the house, walking briskly through the biting air,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">and crunching the crusted snow under their quick footsteps. Though but</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">little after sunset, owing to the heavy clouds, it was almost dark when</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">they hurried along the streets. There was the usual number of</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">foot-passengers abroad, and once, as the slight figure of a man in a</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">military cloak swiftly hurried past, Mrs. Knight felt her arm suddenly</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">grasped with spasmodic force by her companion, and turning around, she</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">saw the face of Zuleime deadly pale.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Why, what is the matter, my dear child?”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Nothing, nothing!” said Zuleime; “let us hurry on.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“But you are trembling like an aspen leaf! You have walked too far—you</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">are not strong enough for this evening’s work; let me take you home</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">again.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“No, no, no, no! let’s go on!”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Why, Zuleime—”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Oh, it is nothing—nothing when you hear it! I—I felt the presence of</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">one long dead! It was weak nerves, or fancy, or perhaps the prescience</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">of one on the confines of the unseen world. Let us hasten on.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">They hurried along. In the meantime, he who had passed them, the slight</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">man in the military cloak, walked on down the square, suddenly stopped,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">muttered to himself, “Absurd! impossible!” then went on again, again</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">stopped, as by an irresistible impulse, turned and rapidly retraced his</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">steps, after the two ladies in black, overtook them, was close behind</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">them, but not placing any confidence in what he termed his own wild</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">thoughts, he dared not accost or peep under the bonnets of two reserved</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">and closely veiled women. But he kept them in sight until he saw them</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">enter the side door of the theatre. Then he asked a door-keeper—</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Who are those?”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Two of the ladies attached to the theatre,” replied the man.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Fool that I was!” exclaimed Frank Fairfax, as he turned away.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Captain Fairfax had reached Richmond that day at noon—too late, by half</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">a day, for the stage to L——, whither he would have gone, if possible, on</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">the wings of the wind. His mother, warned by the newspapers, had been</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">daily expecting his arrival, and was prepared to receive him when he</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">presented himself. He had spent the whole afternoon with her at Fairview</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">House, and in the evening had walked out to book his place in the next</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">day’s stage for L——. It was when hurrying along on that errand, that he</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">passed so near his wife, electrifying her with his unknown presence, and</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">being himself drawn to follow, and to hover near her all the evening.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">For when he had turned from the theatre, and hurried on and reached the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">stage office and secured his place, finding out that the coach did not</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">start till three o’clock the next morning, he said to himself—</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“How on earth shall I contrive to forget some of these miserable hours</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">that must intervene before I can fly to my wife? My mother’s ill-health</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">obliges her to retire early to bed. If I go back to Fairview House, I</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">shall have the whole mansion to myself. I will even go to the theatre,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">and see if I can find out among the women there the particular one whose</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">air and gait reminded me so strongly of my Zuleime.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">And so to the theatre he went. It was quite early, and he was fortunate</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">in securing a seat in the centre of the first row of boxes, immediately</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">in front of the stage. In the meantime, Zuleime had been conducted by</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Mrs. Knight into the theatre, and introduced into the common</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">dressing-room of the stock actresses. This was a large room, with a</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">broad shelf or dresser running around three sides of the walls, and</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">about four feet from the floor. This served as bureaus, dressing-tables,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">and wash-stands for nine women, each of the three sides being occupied</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">by three, who equally divided the shelf, each one having her hand-boxes</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">under the shelf, and her looking-glass on top of it, leaning against the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">wall, and her wash-basin, jars of rouge, boxes of powder, pots of</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">pomatum, etc., standing around it. On introducing her companion into</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">this apartment, Mrs. Knight said—</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“All women belonging to the theatre use this as a common dressing-room,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">except the ballet girls, who have one to themselves, and the stars, who</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">have separate and well furnished rooms.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">About half a dozen women were present now, each before her own glass,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">with her own tallow candle, making her toilet.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Who’s that, Knight, that you’ve got there?” asked a coarse-featured,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">black-eyed girl, who always played the hoyden, or the wit, and fondly</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">believed herself a proficient in the Rosalind and Beatrice line. “I say,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Knight! is that the young ‘lady?’” she repeated, turning around with a</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">little wad of raw cotton, dipped in carmine, between her finger and</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">thumb, and exhibiting a face in process of being rejuvenated—namely,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">with one young and blooming cheek, and one prematurely old and sallow.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Yes, this is the young lady, Barry,” said Mrs. Knight, very gravely, as</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">she led her protégé off to her own corner of the common dresser.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“I think she might have sent her down with the ballet girls, as she is</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">really one of them,” grumbled a large, important looking female,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">arranging a huge turban and curls upon her head, at the farther end of</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">the room. Two new ideas besides that of the common dressing-room and the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">dressing shelf in general, Zuleime had got—namely, first, that there</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">really was some very lofty notions of rank and exclusiveness even among</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">the members of the stock company of a second rate theatre—secondly, that</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">they really, after all, did not differ much in that or any other respect</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">from people she had met in very high society, except, indeed, that they</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">had the odious habit of calling each other “Knight” or “Barry,” as men</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">do, without a prefix of any sort.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Mrs. Knight dressed herself for her part, as she was to appear in the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">early scene in the play, and then gave the use of her toilet nook to</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Zuleime. But the cold walk through the evening air, and the standing in</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">the chilly dressing-room, had so increased her cough, that Mrs. Knight</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">went out and sent a call-boy for opium, and administered a dose. It was</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">under the influence of that stupefier that Zuleime, leaning on the arm</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">of Mrs. Knight, entered that terra-incognita, the green-room. It was a</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">long room, papered, curtained, carpeted, furnished with sofas and</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">easy-chairs, and warmed by a fine coal fire—upon the whole it differed</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">in no other respect than its motley crowd, from a large family parlor.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Mrs. Knight conducted her to a corner of the sofa nearest the fire, and</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">leaving her sitting there, obeyed the call-boy’s summons, and went upon</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">the stage. Composed into a dreamy state by the opium, Zuleime sat there</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">while the strange scene, with its fantastical crowd, passed before her</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">like the phantasmagoria of a midnight dream. And all this time Frank sat</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">in the centre box of the front row, not seeing the play enacting before</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">him—not thinking of it, only seeing the turnpike road to L——. Only</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">thinking of the dearest girl in the world, whom he should meet at the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">end of his journey. Paper walls again!</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Zuleime remained in the corner of the sofa near the fire in the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">green-room, not thinking at all, not even dreaming, only conscious in a</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">vague dreamy way, that a strange vision, changing and changing like</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">figures in the kaleidoscope, was passing before her. She was scarcely</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">aroused by Mrs. Knight’s gentle voice, saying in her ear—</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Come, my dear, it is time for you to go on now. Come, don’t be afraid.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Bless you, you are nobody, you know. No one will look at you. You will</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">be only one of a group that forms a sort of back-ground to the scene.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Come, I will go with you to the side entrance, where the others stand.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Zuleime obeyed mechanically, and was led, between various walls of</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">canvas, to a side entrance, at which were grouped a number of persons in</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">villagers’ costume.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“There, just go on with the crowd, and stand there, that is all you have</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">to do,” whispered Mrs. Knight, as she left her.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">And at the same moment the group moved on, carrying the somnolent</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Zuleime with them, and she found herself in a dazzling glare of light,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">and heard the deafening rant of a stentorian lunged actor near her, and</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">grew painfully conscious of the many hundred eyes upon the scene, upon</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">herself, perhaps—and dared not raise her eyes an instant from the floor,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">upon which, with a deeply burning cheek, they were fixed. But suddenly</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">an attraction—a fatality—I know not what—but something stronger than her</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">fear, stronger than her will, drew her glance up to the centre box of</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">the front row, and her eyes met Frank’s eyes. Yes, there he sat, gazing</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">at her, astonished, fixed, spell-bound as by a nightmare, without the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">power of moving or waking. She! she too, gazed for a moment. She was not</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">astonished at seeing him there, any more than she would have been</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">astonished at _dreaming_ of seeing him anywhere. It was all like a wild</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">dream, everything! It seemed not unnatural that he should form a part of</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">it. Only to her weakened and half-stupefied brain, the _last, nearest_</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">event was the most distinct—and so, strangely, she did not think of his</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">death or life, but only of the reproach she had brought upon _him_, her</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">proud Frank, in appearing there! and covering her face with both hands,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">she sank to her knees upon the floor.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">It was lucky the drop-curtain fell just then. It was lucky the audience</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">took that by-scene for a part of the play. But to Zuleime it was still</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">like a fever-dream, from which she tried to wake. Like a dream the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">drop-curtain had rolled down. But not like a dream was the rough seizure</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">of her arm by a girl who set her upon her feet, and said, in a not</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">unfriendly tone—</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“What did you do that for? _That_ warn’t a part of _your_ part.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“I—I—have,” began Zuleime, passing her hand back and forth across her</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">forehead, “I have been taking opium to stop my cough. I—never was used</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">to it, and I think it has bewildered me a little; don’t _you_ think so?”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“I think _something_ has! Wake up, and try to listen to what is going</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">on. Mr. —— is going to sing now. Come off.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">As the girl led her away between the walls of canvas, one of those</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">insignificant incidents occurred, upon which nevertheless the fate of</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">hundreds sometimes hang. Away among the back scenes through which they</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">passed to reach the green-room, there was a chandelier hanging flaring</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">in the draught. A boy seemed busy with it.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Hoist it up higher, sir, why don’t you?” exclaimed one of the players,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">who happened to come up.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“If I do, it will set fire to the scenes,” replied the boy.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Confound your insolence, do you think I would give you the order, if</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">there were the least danger! Do as you are directed, sir.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">The boy obeyed; and the scenery instantly took fire. The chandelier was</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">hastily drawn down; the alarm was given in the rear of the stage, and a</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">scene shifter directed to cut the cords by which the combustible</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">material was suspended. But the man became panic struck and fled.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">The performers and their assistants in vain sought to take down the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">scenery. The canvas was covered with a resinous composition, and the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">draught of wind was strong; and Zuleime and her companion were swiftly</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">encircled by walls of blazing canvas. The strong girl, terror-stricken,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">left her weak companion and fled. And the poor invalid, forgotten by all</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">in the terror and confusion, sank down overpowered, suffocated by the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">heat and smoke. All this had happened in less than three minutes from</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">the raising of the chandelier.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">And at this time one of the performers was playing near the orchestra,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">and the greater part of the stage, with its appalling danger, was</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">fatally concealed from the audience by the curtain. The flames spread</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">with the rapidity of lightning; and the first notice the audience had of</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">their danger, was the fire falling from the ceiling upon the head of the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">performer. Even then many supposed it to be a part of the play, and were</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">for a short time restrained from flight by a cry from the stage that</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">there was no danger. But soon the fire flashed in every part of the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">house with a rapidity horrible and appalling. Then terror seized upon</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">the hearts of all, and the audience broke up in confusion. Those in the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">pit escaped by the pit entrance, and were every one saved. Those in the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">boxes, who, had they known it, might _at first_ have escaped by way of</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">the pit, all turned and hurried towards the only door of egress into the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">lobby. This door was unfortunately hung to open on the inside. And this</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">circumstance was fatally overlooked by the frenzied crowd, who pressed</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">and pressed against the door, trying to push it open, but really keeping</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">it fast closed. The fire advanced upon them, filling the house with</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">suffocating smoke, and with flame that seized the clothing of those</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">behind, goading them horribly to still more frantic pressure upon those</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">before. The most frightful uproar ensued; women shrieking, praying—men</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">groaning, expostulating; all crowding one upon another, or rather</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">hundreds upon hundreds, and all pressing towards the door that would not</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">yield. The pit was now a lake of fire, darting out huge tongues of flame</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">that wound themselves around the forms of the hindmost, who fell</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">shriveled into the blaze. Then arose cries of horror, anguish and</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">despair—children crying for lost parents, and parents calling in agony</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">upon the names of missing children—for in the fierce pushing and</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">struggling for life, parties got separated and families divided—children</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">forced from the parents, women from their protectors, and the weaker</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">unconsciously thrown down and trampled to death by the strong. Many,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">half roasted, dropped into the burning pit; many with their garments in</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">flames, maddened by pain and terror, threw themselves headlong from the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">windows, and met another death. Many even chanced to save their lives in</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">that way at the cost of broken limbs. And at last the door yielded; and</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">as many as possible escaped that way; but to what a life, alas! darkened</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">forever by the memory of dearest relatives and friends who perished in</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">the fire. The whole building was now in flames. In less than an hour all</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">was over. Naught remained but a heap of smoking ruins; and around them</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">the agonized crowd of those who lived and raved—and around these again,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">an awe-struck, mourning city.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>

<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">The spell that bound Captain Fairfax, when he recognized his wife upon</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">the stage, was broken by the fall of the drop-curtain. He instantly left</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">the boxes and hastened around behind the scenes. After many baffled</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">inquiries, and many misdirections, he prosecuted his search alone, and</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">at length found her prostrate form. The wind had blown the smoke and</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">flame in another direction, and she lay there uninjured, though</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">insensible, and in extremity of danger. He raised her, threw his cloak</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">around her, ran with her into the fresh air, called a hackney coach,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">placed her in it, jumped in and took his seat by her side, drew her</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">insensible form within his arms, upon his bosom, and directed the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">coachman to drive rapidly to Fairview House. As they passed swiftly</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">through the streets, the cry of “Fire! fire! fire!” rung through the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">air, but he scarcely heard it. The rushing of crowds of people in the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">opposite direction to that in which they were driving, frequently</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">impeded the progress of the carriage, but he scarcely knew it. All his</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">senses, all his thoughts, all his emotions were absorbed in the gentle</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">form that lay swooning on his bosom. And “Oh! how _thin_ she is! how</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">_thin_, good Heaven!” he groaned many times, as he held his arm around</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">the fragile waist, or felt the emaciated arm and hand, or pressed his</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">cheek against the wan face. “How thin she is, good Heaven, how thin! Is</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">this illness? Illness unto death, perhaps! Drive fast, coachman! Fast!”</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">He longed to lay her at rest upon her bed, that he might perchance</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">silence his anxiety. And—“Faster, coachman! Faster!” he continued to</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">cry, whenever the thickening crowd arrested the progress of the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">carriage.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">At length they reached Fairview House. He lifted her out and bore her</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">into the hall. His mother had retired to rest long since; but he rang</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">the bell violently, and said, to the astonished servants, who came at</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">the summons—</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Go instantly and prepare a room for my wife. I have but just saved her</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">from the burning theatre!” The wonder-struck maids hurried to obey.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Stop! Don’t disturb your mistress, on your lives,” he said, and with</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">this warning, dismissed them. To one of the men present, he exclaimed,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Run instantly to Doctor Cummings, and ask him to hurry hither.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">The man disappeared to obey. And during the issuing of these orders,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Frank Fairfax was sitting on the sofa, sustaining the fainting form of</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">his wife with one arm, while with the other hand he unlaced the velvet</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">boddice. Presently one of the maids returned and announced that the room</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">was ready. And Frank raised and carried his precious burden up stairs,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">into a pleasant front chamber, and laid her on a bed. Then, with the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">assistance of one of the women, he got off the stage dress, and supplied</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">its place with one of his mother’s white wrappers, brought for the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">purpose by one of the maids.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">He had scarcely done this, when the chamber door opened, and old Mrs.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Fairfax entered, roused up by the noise in and outside the house. She</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">came in, wrapped in a flannel dressing-gown, and saying, anxiously—</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“My dear Frank! they tell me that the Richmond Theatre is on fire. I am</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">so grateful that you are not there. Ah what is this? Who is that?” she</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">asked, perceiving the form of Zuleime upon the bed, and advancing</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">towards it. “Some sufferer you have saved from the fire, my dear Frank?</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">God bless your brave, kind heart, my dear boy. But you should not have</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">brought her in here—or you should not be here yourself. Retire, and</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">leave the lady to the care of myself and my women,” concluded the lady,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">gravely.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“My dearest mother, yes! She is a sufferer I have saved from the fire! a</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">most beloved sufferer! my wife! my wife! Dearest mother, I cannot leave</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">her! I have a _right_ to stay here.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Here followed a wild, hasty disclosure of his imprudent marriage, kept</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">secret up to that moment. And then amid the grief and surprise of Mrs.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Fairfax, he also learned the fact of Mr. Clifton’s death, and of</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Zuleime’s disappearance and suspected suicide. In bitter self-reproach,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Frank had made his confession—in deepest sorrow, he heard his mother’s</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">revelations.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“How much she must have suffered! Good Heaven! how much she must have</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">suffered!” he exclaimed. Then almost madly he cried, “Mother! look at</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">her! Look at her! Oh, tell me, do you think she can live?”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Mrs. Fairfax had been all this time chafing her temples with cologne,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">while the two maids rubbed her hands and feet. But up to this instant</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">she had given no signs of recovery, or of consciousness. And the old</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">lady shook her head mournfully, and plunged Frank into deeper despair.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">They persevered in their efforts for half an hour longer, and then she</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">sighed and opened her eyes. Her husband was bending over her. She met</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">his eyes, and smiled faintly in recognition, without astonishment, and</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">without joy—indeed she was too feeble for either—and murmuring, “Dearest</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Frank,” she sank away again, fainting, they supposed, until her low</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">breathing revealed that she slept the sleep of utter prostration. And</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">how changed was now that countenance. The look of weariness, care and</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">sorrow had vanished, and the sweet, wan face wore the easy, confiding</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">air of infancy; and even in sleep, she must have felt the shelter of</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">protecting love around her, for often with closed eyes she smiled, as in</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">delighted visions! All night they watched beside her bed while she</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">slept. In the morning the doctor arrived. He had been absent all night,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">by the couch of one who had been severely burned at the theatre, and</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">that accounted for his failure to come before morning; now, however, he</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">stood beside the patient with grave and thoughtful brow.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Doctor, for Heaven’s sake give me some hope of her. Tell me something</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">about her, at least! Is she ill?”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“She is very ill,” replied the physician.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“I cannot believe it! I will not believe it! See how sweetly she sleeps!</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">how comfortably! how free from suffering!”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Yes—but, my dear Captain Fairfax, there would be more hope if there</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">were more suffering—however, the case may be much more favorable than it</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">appears to me now; I cannot fully judge of it until she wakes.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Allow me to arouse her, then! Nay, I wish to do it! I have not spoken</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">to her yet! Let me wake her now!”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“By no means! It might prove fatal. Indeed, you must be very careful.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Her life hangs by a thread. Sleep will do her more good now than</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">anything else. When she awakes naturally, you may send for me at once.”</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">And so saying, the doctor took leave, without even writing a</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">prescription.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Soon after he left the house she opened her eyes again, and seeing</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Frank, smiled faintly, and murmured—</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“My own—my dearest—dearest husband.” And in an instant her senses seemed</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">swallowed up again in sleep, which lasted half an hour, at the end of</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">which she awoke again, and looked around in uneasiness, and breathed,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">half aloud,—“My child—my baby—my little Fan—” and then sank away again,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">as if she were too feeble to retain her hold on consciousness.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“What is she talking about, dear mother?” inquired Frank, in the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">extremity of anxiety, when he heard her words.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Mrs. Fairfax shook her head, and said she did not know. But the woman</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">who waited in the chamber came forward, and said that if her mistress</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">would excuse her interfering, _she_ would tell them what the young lady</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">meant.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Speak on, then, at once, in the name of the Lord!” exclaimed Frank,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">impatiently.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Mrs. Fairfax endorsed his order. And then the woman informed her</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">mistress that she had known the sick young lady all the winter by</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">sight—that she had been there at the house to ask for sewing—that she</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">took in sewing for a living—that she lodged at the cabinet-maker’s, over</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">the way—and that she had a little girl almost two years old, who was no</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">doubt at the cabinet-maker’s now, which she supposed was what had made</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">the mother look around, and inquire so anxiously.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">The woman’s story was scarcely over before Captain Fairfax seized his</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">hat, and hurried from the room. As soon as he was gone, Mrs. Fairfax</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">called the woman up before her, and said—</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Nelly, you heard your master tell me of his marriage with this young</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">lady?”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Yes, madam.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“I need not tell you that it is my will that there be no kitchen gossip</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">about this matter. This young lady—once Miss Zuleime Clifton, is now,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">and has been for nearly three years past, Mrs. Francis Fairfax, the wife</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">of my son, and is also your own young mistress. You understand?”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Yes, madam.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Then let there be no idle conversation about this marriage, if you</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">would avoid my severest displeasure.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Farther colloquy was arrested by the hurried entrance of Captain</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Fairfax, bringing his little wee girl in his arms. Mrs. Fairfax</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">immediately arose to take her from him, but the child’s quick eyes had</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">recognized her mother lying on the bed, and she began to clap her hands</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">and call—</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Mamma! mamma!”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Frank held her closely, and tried to still her joyful, eager cries, but</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">the magical sound of her child’s voice had already awakened the sleeper,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">and she opened her eyes, and seeing the babe in its father’s arms,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">smiled a feeble smile of content, and fell away again into oblivion.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Mrs. Fairfax had the doctor summoned again, and told him that if he</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">wished to see her daughter-in-law awake, he must remain at her bedside,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">for that she only awoke to relapse instantly into slumber.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">The physician then took his seat by the bedside of his patient, and</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">requested all except a maid-servant to leave the chamber.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Mrs. Fairfax and Frank went out, taking the little girl with them, and</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">leaving the doctor with the invalid.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">After the lapse of an hour, the physician came out and went down stairs.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Captain Fairfax was waiting for him in the hall, and drew him into the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">parlor, anxiously requesting to know his opinion. Perhaps he was really</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">sanguine, and hoped the doctor’s verdict might set his fears at rest. At</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">any rate he insisted upon knowing the precise state of the case. The</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">doctor gravely motioned him to sit down, and then took a seat himself.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">He said that his patient was not sinking so much under any local disease</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">as under a general atrophy, for which, considering _the circumstances_,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">he could not possibly account—_for_, if he had met precisely such a case</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">in the very lowest walks of life, he should at once have declared that</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">the patient had been brought to this state by the want of proper and</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">sufficient food—that, in short, she was dying of a slow starvation. A</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">deep groan broke from the lips of Francis Fairfax, and he started up,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">covered his face with his hands, and walked the floor in rapid strides.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Suddenly he stopped before the physician, with a countenance convulsed</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">with grief and remorse, with all pride and hesitation gone, and</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">exclaimed, in thrilling tones—</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Doctor! suppose her case—my wife’s case had been as you would have</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">surmised, finding it any where else!—suppose that for months past she</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">has been starving—Great God—_starving_!—Now that the cause of this utter</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">failure of the vital powers is removed—now that she has every thing that</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">wealth, that the most devoted affection can give her, may she not</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">recruit and live? Oh! tell me?”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">The physician answered sternly—</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“I do not know, sir! This tampering with the laws of life—this pursuing</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">it to the very edge of death is not safe. Is she inclined to take food</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">at all?”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“No—only a little gruel, and that mechanically, without appetite.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Exactly—a few days fasting makes one ravenous, but a long, partial</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">starvation so exhausts the victim, that he loses all inclination for</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">food, as well as all power to assimilate it.” The doctor spoke severely.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Sir! I forgive your sternness and your evident suspicions, perhaps they</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">are partially just. If they were otherwise, God knows I am so stricken</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">that I have scarcely manhood enough left to resent them—but oh! tell</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">me—do not evade the question. Can she be restored? and how?”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Captain Fairfax, I told you that she was sinking, not so much under any</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">local disorder as under general atrophy—and yet she _has_ a local</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">disease superinduced by this same slow starvation. Upon examination by</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">the stethoscope, I find tubercles forming upon the left lung. There is</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">also morbid action of the heart. You know how it is with phthisis! With</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">proper care, and under favorable circumstances, the patient may live for</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">years, perhaps for many years, and die at length in old age of something</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">else.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Oh, _no_ care, _no_ pains—nothing that money—nothing that love can do,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">shall be wanting! There is hope?”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“I dare not say there is _much_ hope in this instance. This atrophy is a</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">very unfavorable thing—all our hope is in being able to save the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">digestive functions. I have left a prescription, with written</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">directions, above stairs.” The doctor took his hat, and saying that he</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">would see the invalid again in the afternoon, departed.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“All alike! all alike! They sway from right to left, raising one’s</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">hopes, and then rousing their fears! He lies! he lies! It is not so! she</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">is in no danger! Great God she must not die! she shall not!” So</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">unjustly, wildly, sinfully Frank Fairfax talked, walking distractedly up</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">and down the floor, convulsed by grief, remorse and fear for her he</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">loved so strongly, and felt he had wronged so greatly. He dared not seek</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">her bedside now in his excited state—he rushed into his library, locked</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">the door, and gave himself up to all the power of remorse.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">In the afternoon he sought the sick room again. And the deep, sweet</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">peace that pervaded the apartment fell like a soothing spell upon his</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">excited nerves. The front windows were open, for the day was very fine,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">and the fresh air and the sunshine came in together, with the cheerful</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">view of the expanse of water, and the wooded hills across James River.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">The coolness of the air was sufficiently tempered by a glowing coal fire</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">in the grate. Zuleime lay raised up with pillows on the bed, and upon</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">the counterpane by her sat her little girl. The face of the youthful</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">mother seemed as soft, as feeble, and as free of care and sorrow as that</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">of the infant herself. On seeing Frank enter, she smiled a gentle,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">pleased, childish smile, and feebly moved her hand towards him. He went</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">to her, at first successfully repressing all his strong emotions, and</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">kissed her very gently, but then sank upon his knees, and dropping his</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">face upon her hand, burst into tears, and wept passionately. Her other</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">hand wandered playfully through his curls, and she said, gently—</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Don’t weep, Frank, please don’t—indeed I am happy—it is so nice to be</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">here—don’t weep.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">But when men weep and sob, it is no passing shower, like the easily shed</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">tears of women, but a great gust, shaking all the nature. So it was a</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">long time before Frank mastered his emotion. When he recovered his</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">composure, and arose and sat by her side and looked at her, he found</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">that the hectic fever burned crimson on her cheeks, and that her</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">brilliant eyes wandered about deliriously. And he knew that he had</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">harmed her again. And soon she began to talk at random, babbling</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">childishly, delightfully, about White Cliffs, and the forest walks, and</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">the garden. And she addressed her father and sister, as if they were</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">present. And very lovingly she spoke to Catherine; or, coming nearer to</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">the present moment, talked with Ida about her feminine shrinking from</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">appearing upon the stage. Frank listened in the deepest trouble, and in</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">the wandering of her mind he learned much that had transpired at White</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Cliffs, a great deal that had occurred since her flight thence, and</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">_all_ that he ought to have known.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">When the physician arrived in the evening, he instituted strict</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">inquiries, and discovered the cause of her high fever. Then he rebuked</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">the indiscretion of her friends, and leaving fresh prescriptions, with</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">peremptory orders that the deepest quiet should be preserved, departed.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Her fever unabated raged all night. In the morning it went off.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Captain Fairfax would not permit himself to enter her room again until</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">he had obtained the power of perfect self-control. At about eleven</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">o’clock he went in. The crimson curtains of the windows were drawn</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">aside, and the room was light and cheerful. The white muslin drapery of</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">the bedstead was festooned, and revealed the fair invalid reclining</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">there, wan, placid, child-like as ever. She welcomed her husband with</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">the same soft, faint smile. And he went and sat by her side, and</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">crushing down all strong emotions, took her hand, and spoke to her</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">calmly and pleasantly, inquiring how she felt.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“So well—it is so nice to be here,” she answered simply. And she lay</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">there looking at him contentedly, smiling softly, answering vaguely when</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">he spoke to her; but never asking any question; or making any comment;</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">or volunteering any speech whatever. This pained him more than all—for</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">he knew that mind as well as body was sinking—lapsing away into a sort</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">of dreamy, happy fatuity. And all attempts to rouse her from that state</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">only threw her into fever, and often into delirium.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">One day, with a view to interest without exciting her, he inquired—</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Dearest, is there any one you would like to see?”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Yes—Ida,” she said.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“And who is Ida, love?” asked Frank, very cautiously and gently, for he</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">felt as if he were running the risk of hurting her again.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Ida! La! don’t you know? She was so good to me,” she replied, with a</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">pitying smile.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Captain Fairfax left the room, and at a venture went over to inquire at</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">the cabinet-maker’s. And he soon returned, accompanied by Mrs. Knight.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Zuleime received her visitor without any emotion whatever; smiling</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">gently, and holding out her hand, and afterwards lying and silently and</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">pleasantly watching her as she sat by the bed. And when she arose to</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">leave, she put up her lips for a kiss. Poor Ida pressed those lips very</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">gently, and then quietly left the room: but as soon as she had passed</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">the door, burst into tears.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Every day Zuleime’s mind flowed away. Every day she became more</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">infantile in weakness and simplicity. One day she made known a wish—the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">only one she had ever voluntarily expressed. It was affecting from its</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">utter childishness.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Dear Frank, you and your mother are rich. I want you to bring Ida and</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">her child home to live here, so that she may not have to go on the stage</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">any more.” She reverted to this subject so frequently, repeating this,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">the only wish she had ever expressed, so often and earnestly, that her</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">husband felt strongly inclined to gratify her desire, strange as it</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">really was. He consulted his mother, and they concluded that it might be</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">done, in a measure. Then they told her that it should be as she wished;</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">that Ida and her child should come and live with them, if she would.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Captain Fairfax went again to the cabinet-maker’s, saw the poor actress,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">and told her that his wife needed a female companion to sit with her a</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">portion of the day, and that she would hear of no one for the post but</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">her old friend, Mrs. Knight, if Mrs. Knight would come and name her own</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">salary. And when he had let slip that last word, he turned away his face</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">with his forehead burning under the astonished, indignant gaze of those</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">proud, dark eyes of Ida’s, as she said—</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Captain Fairfax, I receive a ‘salary’ in the regular line of my</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">profession, when I am engaged in it; as Captain Fairfax also receives</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">pay for his military services—but as he would spurn all offers of</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">pecuniary remuneration for attentions to a wounded comrade, so should I</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">decline all compensation for attentions to a sick neighbor; and I am</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">most surprised that you should have made such a proposal to me.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">So was Captain Fairfax himself really surprised that he should have been</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">betrayed into such an error, as to forget that the very profession of</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">the poor tragic actress really fostered a morbid pride. Her phrases</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">might have been a little stilted after the manner of the stage, but the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">sentiments were really true and high, and worthy of all consideration.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">So Captain Fairfax apologized, as he best could, and arose to take his</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">leave. Then she said—</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Do not quite misunderstand me. I am very anxious to do all in my power</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">to serve Mrs. Fairfax, for I love her dearly! I am willing to devote all</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">my time, night and day, to her service, for the affection I bear her.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">And I can do it now; for since the burning of the theatre I have been</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">disengaged.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Captain Fairfax replied by expressing his grateful acknowledgments of</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">her kindness, and begging her to come over frequently to see his wife.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Then he took leave indeed and returned home, with the determination to</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">ask his mother to go and invite Mrs. Knight to come and spend a few</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">weeks with her friend at Fairview House. Old Mrs. Fairfax had quite a</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">struggle with her Virginian pride and prejudices, before she could make</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">up her mind to ask an actress to become her guest, but benevolence</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">conquered, and as whatever she once resolved upon doing she did</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">graciously and gracefully, she called upon Mrs. Knight, and gave her the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">invitation in a manner that insured its acceptance. Ida, with her little</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">girl, came over the next day. And the old lady felt fully rewarded for</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">her self-conquest, when she saw the smile of childish delight with which</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">the gentle patient greeted her poor friend.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“See, Ida,” murmured Zuleime, as her visitor seated herself at the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">bedside, “see, Ida, we are both now in the nice house we used to look at</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">so longingly from our poor, back windows.” She paused from weakness, and</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">then said, “I used to call it my _Heaven_, you know! Ah, I did not know</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">it was really _my_ Heaven. I did not know Frank had ever lived here—how</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">strange!” She paused again, but this time from thought, as well as from</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">exhaustion, and then she took breath and said again, “I never could make</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">it out clearly and it makes my head ache to try. But see, dear Ida. Look</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">at the crimson window-curtains—don’t you know they are the very same</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">crimson curtains that used to throw the warm, red glow across the snow,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">when we used to sit at the back window and watch them, and almost envy</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">the people that lived here?”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Yes, I know, but do not talk too much, darling.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“I won’t—but it is so strange. There, look through the windows, you can</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">see our little, narrow, pinched, back windows, with their check</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">curtains, as plainly from here, as we used to see these from there. We</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">did not think we should ever get here to live, did we?—how strange!”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Her talk, rambling as it was, revealed one hopeful fact—that her mind</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">was at length waking up. Frank saw it with joy. Day by day, from this</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">time, her intellect seemed to clear and strengthen. Frank spoke of this</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">to the doctor, who heard him with great gravity, and without comment.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">As winter advanced towards spring, her mind “brightened more and more</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">towards the perfect day.” She had gleaned, partly from scraps of speech</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">carelessly dropped, and partly by inquiry, the history of Frank’s</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">captivity among the Shoshonowas, that first originated the report of his</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">death—and she was very gradually brought to understand the true position</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">of affairs—so gradually through so many weeks, that the knowledge may be</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">said rather to have slowly grown upon her. But as her mind cleared and</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">strengthened, her heart became saddened and depressed. She understood</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">too much now for her happiness. She no longer lay and watched her</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">husband with a delighted smile as he sat beside her bed—no, but rather</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">with a look of earnest, mournful love. Well she might. Frank was sad</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">enough—he thought his heart was breaking.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">One day, while lying propped up by pillows, she heard the name of Mrs.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Georgia Clifton mentioned.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Is she in the city?” inquired she.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Yes, love,” replied her husband.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Send for her to come and see me—I _must_ see her.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Captain Fairfax arose and left the room immediately, and instead of</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">sending a servant, went himself to bring Mrs. Georgia. For so great was</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">his desire to gratify promptly every wish of his loved one’s heart, that</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">he seldom trusted the execution of them to any but himself, lest they</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">should fail or be delayed. It was well in this instance, at least, that</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">he went in person. A servant could not have effected the purpose. The</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">conscience-stricken Georgia would not have ventured to come. Even when</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">unannounced, by reason of his haste, Captain Fairfax entered her parlor,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">the beauty turned deadly pale, under the fear of detected guilt. But</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">when she saw his calm, kind manner, and heard him entreat, as a favor,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">that she would put on her bonnet immediately, and return with him to see</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">his wife, who was extremely ill at Fairview, the sorceress was</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">reassured, and with her usual bewitching grace consented to accompany</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">him.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">When they arrived at Fairview House, and were shown up into the sick</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">chamber, the patient smiled and held out her hands. Georgia hastened</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">towards her, and seized both hands, covering them with kisses, and</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">making a show of great emotion. Zuleime raised her feeble voice, and</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">begged all to go out of the room, and leave her alone with her visitor.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">And when every one had departed, and the door was closed, she said—</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Sit down, please, here by my bedside.” Mrs. Georgia took the nurse’s</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">arm-chair. “Dear Georgia,” she said, gently taking both her hands, and</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">looking kindly in her face, “I sent for you, because I thought you must</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">be so unhappy about what you have unintentionally caused me to suffer.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">And I wished to tell you not to remember it in bitterness any more. Oh!</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">I grieve so much at the memory of what I have made my dear father</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">suffer, that I can feel for others who are tortured by remorse, and I</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">would not, for the whole world, that any one should mourn for what they</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">have caused me to suffer. So, dear Georgia, I acquit you of all blame,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">from the bottom of my heart, indeed I do—and I pray that God may make</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">you happier than _I_ have ever been. And I will never, never drop a</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">hint, by which any one shall suspect—I mean I will never let fall a word</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">to any one, that shall injure you, Georgia. I would not die and bequeath</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">you so bitter a legacy as an enemy. Though I knew you would not come and</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">ask me, I sent for you to assure you of this, Georgia, and to reconcile</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">myself with you, that we might be friends before I die. And now, God</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">bless you! Kiss me, and say good-bye, for my fever is rising.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">And she held up her lips. Georgia was weeping.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Zuleime, my dear child, why don’t you call me mamma, as heretofore?”</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">she asked.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Oh, don’t you know long ago you told me not to do it. But I will, if</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">you wish it, now. Kiss me, dear mamma. There, now, go and be at peace.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Georgia hurried from the room. They never met again.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Zuleime revived slightly when the spring opened. She had heard that her</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">sister Carolyn had nearly recovered her health, and was just about to</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">set out on her voyage home. And two secret wishes the poor girl</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">indulged: once more to visit White Cliffs, and to live to see her only</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">sister again. But she kept them to herself in the fear of giving Frank</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">trouble, for she knew that he would try to move Heaven and earth to</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">please her, and deeply grieve if he should fail. She concealed her</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">wants, but they were discovered by him who watched day and night to</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">anticipate her wishes. And Captain Fairfax called upon the family</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">physician, and consulted him upon the possibility of taking Zuleime to</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">White Cliffs, as soon as the spring weather should be permanently</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">settled. The physician’s opinion was highly favorable to his wishes. He</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">said that she might be removed by easy stages to the country, and that</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">if proper care and attention were bestowed, the journey and the change</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">of air would probably be found very beneficial to her health. Captain</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Fairfax hastened home to cheer his wife with the news. And she was</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">gladdened by it. She caught both his hands and kissed them, and held</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">them to her face, and looking at him fondly, said—</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Dear Frank! dearest Frank! you try to perform miracles for me!”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">The same night, Captain Fairfax wrote to Mrs. Clifton, of Hardbargain,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">to go over to White Cliffs and prepare to receive the invalid. And from</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">that day Zuleime revived, and by the first of June was so much better,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">as to be able to be placed in the comfortable family carriage, in which,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">sometimes reclining upon downy cushions, sometimes resting upon the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">bosom of her husband, and supported by his arms, she traveled by easy</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">stages to White Cliffs. They reached the end of their journey upon the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">afternoon of the third day. Mrs. Clifton and Catherine were there to</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">receive them. Zuleime was lifted out of the carriage, very much</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">exhausted. Yet, as she was gently carried through the yard, her eyes</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">roved gladly over all the dear familiar scene—over mountains, fields and</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">forests, clothed now in the luxuriant foliage of June—and all her</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">countenance lighted up with joy, and she exclaimed many times in tones</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">of profound gratitude—</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Thank God! oh, thank God!”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">She was carried up stairs, and put to bed at once. And Catherine was</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">stationed to watch her slumbers, while Mrs. Clifton remained below to</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">attend to the comfort of the tired travelers. But Zuleime frequently</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">awoke with a joyful start and recollection; and once she put her hand in</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">that of Kate, and said—</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Dear Kate! blessed Kate! I am so glad to see you again! And so very</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">glad to be _home_ again! Sweet Sister of Mercy! will you stay and nurse</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">_me_ also? I think you could almost cure me! Sweet, unprofessed nun,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">will you stay and nurse me, too?”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Yes, dear Zuleime, I will stay as long as you want me. But shut those</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">tired eyes, love, and go to sleep.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Yes, seal each eyelid down with a kiss, dear Kate, and then they will</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">stay closed. And hold my hand as I go to sleep—I feel so safe when some</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">one I love holds my hand while I slumber. I feel as if they could keep</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">me in life while I slept, for you must know, dear Kate, that my heart</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">has a morbid action, and some of these days I shall fall asleep lightly</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">as now, but never awake again.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Dear Zuleime, you must not indulge such fancies.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“They are not fancies, they are realities. I do not deceive myself and</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">trifle with you, Kate. Do not you deceive me or trifle with me, either.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">There are secrets of life and death known only to the dying. Such a</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">secret is mine. I know that I shall lightly drop asleep some day, and</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">never wake again—that is the reason I wish some one I love to kiss my</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">eyelids down, and to hold my hand while I slumber.” The words, the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">manner of the dying girl carried deep conviction to the heart of</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Catherine, and—</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Oh! Zuleime,” she said, “lean upon the failing arm of flesh if you</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">will, but, oh, seek! seek the support of that Almighty arm that can</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">sustain you in life and in death! Seek that!”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“I will—I wish to do it, or rather you, the handmaid of the Lord, shall</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">bear me up in your faithful hands, and lay me within that Arm of</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Strength. I wished this long ago, but, oh, my dear husband and his good</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">mother! they thought only of restoring me to health, and I could think</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">of nothing but of trying to live for them, until very lately, when it</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">was revealed to me that I should surely die. I have never yet told Frank</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">anything about this. I feared it would distress him too much; but the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">lone knowledge troubled me. I needed to tell some one of it, some dear</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">one with whom I could converse confidentially, and who should be wise</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">enough to counsel me, patient enough to bear with me, courageous enough</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">to face the result, and who, besides, would not be too greatly</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">distressed, as my dear husband would. And so, sweet Kate, I have told</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">you. Will you now stay with me and nurse me?”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Yes, dear Zuleime, as long as you wish me to do so; but now, darling,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">if I am to be your nurse, you must mind what I have to say to you, and</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">go to sleep.” Catherine bent over her, and kissed her eyelids down upon</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">the weary eyes, and held her hand until she fell asleep. At night,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Captain Fairfax relieved her watch.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">The next morning when Catherine entered the room she sat down by the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">side of the bed, and told her that she had good news to tell, that they</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">had received a letter from Major Clifton, that Carolyn’s health was</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">improving, and that they had embarked, or had purposed to embark upon</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">the first of May, and expected to reach home as soon as the middle of</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">June. Zuleime clasped her hands in fervent thanksgiving while she</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">listened, and when her friend ceased to speak, she exclaimed—</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“In two weeks she will be here—oh! that I may live to see it!”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Kate bade her be of good cheer and hope; and when Catherine told any one</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">to hope, her words and looks and manner all inspired the feeling.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Zuleime was so recovered and enlivened as to be able to be lifted from</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">her bed and placed in the easy-chair by the open window, that looked out</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">upon the mountain scenery, all glorious in the light of summer morning.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Old Mrs. Fairfax, and Mrs. Clifton of Hardbargain, came in to pay her a</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">visit, bringing her little girl with them. As for Captain Fairfax, he</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">seldom left her side. All congratulated the invalid upon her improved</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">health and spirits, and hoped and foretold great results from her</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">residence in the country, and projected many pleasant drives, when she</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">should be a little rested from the fatigue of her journey. Then they</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">talked of Major Clifton and Carolyn’s expected arrival, and laid out</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">extensive plans of amusement to be put in execution when they should</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">come, by which time Zuleime also would be considerably restored. Thus</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">cheerfully, hopefully they talked. And the dying one listened sweetly;</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">but when she found herself alone again with Kate, she said—</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“I let them talk, Catherine, for if they _really_ have any hopes of my</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">recovery, I do not wish to destroy those hopes by telling what I know,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">and if they only talk so to cheer me, why even then I do not like to</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">make them sad by not seeming to believe them. And yet, and yet, perhaps</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">I ought to tell Frank; perhaps I will!”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Catherine devoted herself to the service of the invalid, laboring</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">zealously for her spiritual as for her bodily good, indeed, the girl</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">glided into the performance of such duties as naturally as if she felt</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">herself especially called to the work, born for the work. The selfish</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">wish for her own comfort and pleasure had never been very strong in the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">heart of Catherine; and within the last two years it seemed to have</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">expired. She lived only for the good of others. She had grown to believe</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">that there was no individual happiness for herself, except in the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">service of others. Young hope had died out in her heart, she was</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">resigned. She adopted the submissive words of Mary and her Son, and</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">said, within her heart, in deepest sincerity—</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Behold, the handmaid of the Lord.” “Not my will, but Thine, oh God.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Zuleime was lifted from the bed to the easy-chair every morning, and</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">calmly and profoundly the invalid enjoyed those glorious summer</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">mornings. But she was failing very fast. She grew very anxious for the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">coming of her sister; but, unwilling to disturb any one by her anxiety,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">she confided it only to Kate. They had not heard from Major Clifton</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">since the letter announcing his expected embarkation. They justly</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">supposed him to be on his voyage home, accompanied by Carolyn, and were</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">now daily looking for a letter announcing their landing, and their</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">speedy arrival home. The middle of June passed, and no letter had come.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">The first of July arrived, but brought no news of the voyagers.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Oh, if they had come when they promised, they might have seen me before</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">I died—but I cannot hold out much longer, Kate. I feel as if the longing</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">to meet Carolyn again had kept me up as by the excitement of</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">expectation, but, Kate, I feel very weary, very much inclined to droop,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">yet know if I should give way I should drop into the arms of Death. I</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">wish they would come. I want to see Carolyn. I want to see her happiness</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">with my own eyes. And then it is not for myself—for if I die before she</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">comes, Carolyn will take it very much to heart to know that her poor</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">little sister had been found and had died—so inopportunely, just before</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">she had got home. I wish they would come.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">The second week in July arrived—with three days of cloud, and rain, and</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">gloom. Zuleime could not leave her bed for her favorite seat at the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">window, but Catherine served her with more love and zeal than ever. The</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">family had as yet received no news of the travelers, and though they</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">daily grew more anxious, there was no foreboding in their anxiety.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Sea-voyages at that day were of such uncertain length. All was no doubt</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">well.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">But on the evening of the second rainy day, while Captain Fairfax and</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Catherine sat with Zuleime, and all the other members of the family were</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">assembled in the summer saloon, the door of the latter was quietly</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">opened, and Major Clifton stood before the astonished circle. His mother</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">advanced to meet and welcome him. Then she noticed—and they all noticed,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">that he was clothed in deep mourning. That told the tale! They welcomed</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">him with affectionate sympathy, but no one asked a question. Nor did he</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">as yet volunteer a word of his sorrow’s history. It was only the next</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">day that his mother learned from him how deceptive was the seeming</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">convalescence of his wife—how from the day of their embarkation her</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">strength declined—how for weeks their hearts fluctuated between hope and</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">fear, as with the changes of her flattering disease she seemed better or</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">worse—how when all thought of life was gone, but one earthly hope</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">possessed her soul—to die _at home_;—of the waning of that last hope—of</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">the death at sea—and, finally, of the lone grave in the ocean isle,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">where slept the mortal remains of the haughtiest beauty that ever trod</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">the halls of a palace.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">They would willingly have concealed the fact of her sister’s decease</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">from the dying girl—no one ventured to tell her of the event—they fondly</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">believed that she remained in ignorance of it. But she knew it all from</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">what she saw and heard. She knew that Major Clifton had returned alone,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">and she surmised the rest from the sad and tearful faces of all around</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">her. Yes, she knew it all, as well as any could have made her know it,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">and in the tender thoughtfulness of her soul, she would not distress any</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">by asking them questions relating to the last moment. But from this hour</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">she sank rapidly. She could no longer be lifted from her bed without</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">fainting. In deep trouble, Captain Fairfax summoned the old family</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">physician. When he came, and saw the patient, his opinion was decidedly</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">formed, and truthfully given—he said that the Richmond physician had</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">evidently abandoned the case as hopeless, when he sent her home to</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">die—that her life had probably been prolonged by her residence in the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">country—but that nothing could have saved her—and that she had now not</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">many days to live. Captain Fairfax was almost mad with grief—and all the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">self-possession and self-control that he had learned in the long</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">attendance upon her sick bed well nigh deserted him. It was many hours</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">before he was sufficiently composed to take his usual place by her</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">bedside, and then his agonized countenance betrayed the extent of his</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">suffering. Catherine was sitting by her when he entered. Zuleime raised</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">her dying eyes, and looking at him, tenderly beckoned him to approach.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Then she motioned Catherine to leave her. When they were alone—she laid</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">her hand within his own, and looking at him with unutterable love, said—</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Dear Frank—dearest Frank—I see that you know it all at last. Dearest</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Frank, I have known it a long time. Now let us talk freely and</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">confidentially about it—let there be no more of that painful mist</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">between us as when you thought only of my restoration to health, and I</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">knew I was sinking fast into the grave.” She paused a moment, and then</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">said—“I want so much to comfort you. I have something to say to you.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">His fingers closed upon her hand convulsively. He choked down his</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">strong, rising emotion, and said—</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Do not try to talk, love, the effort will exhaust your strength.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“No—no, it will not. I am not so weak as I was when you came in. Dearest</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Frank, when you sit by me, and hold my hand, new life seems to run up my</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">feeble veins, and I feel stronger. Let me talk, love. Ah! do not look so</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">sad! It is better as it is, love. It is better I should go. I have</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">spoiled my own life, and should spoil yours if I should live. Ah, it is</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">a dreadful thing to occasion the death of any one! it is an awful thing</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">to cause the death of a father. I caused the death of the most loving</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">father that ever lived. And dearest Frank! though in the struggle, in</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">the bitterness of poverty, in the pangs of hunger and of cold, and in</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">the pain and debility of illness, the feeling of compunction has been</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">diverted, yet—had health returned with prosperity—remorse would then</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">have darkened all my life; and in ruining my happiness, would have</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">marred yours. Yes! I have spoiled my own life. It is well that I should</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">not live to spoil yours, dearest Frank! I talk not of expiation _now_.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Nothing that I could do or suffer, would alter the irrevocable past. We</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">have all one Redeemer—Jesus Christ the Righteous. So I talk not of</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">expiating the past; though perhaps if any heart is hardened against me,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">my early death may soften it. But, let me speak of the future—_your_</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">future, dearest Frank, and let me say it is better for all your coming</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">years that I should die.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Oh, do not say so, Zuleime—you break my heart.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Dear Frank, you will grieve for me, I know you will, but be comforted.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">You are so young yet. This sorrow will pass like a morning cloud, and</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">leave all your life a long bright day.” She paused abruptly—a gray</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">shadow swept darkly over her face and vanished. _He_ did not see it, his</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">face was buried in his hands. Then she asked to have her child brought</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">to her. Frank went out, but soon returned to say that little Fan had</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">been put to bed; and to ask her if the child should be waked up. “No, do</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">not wake the poor, little thing,” she said, and then added, “I am very,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">very sleepy, Frank; dearest Frank, kiss my eyelids down to slumber like</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">you always do, and hold my hand till I fall asleep. Kiss my lips, too,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">this time; kiss them last of all—there—good-night, love.” Her voice sank</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">away in a low, inaudible murmur, like a dying sound on the Eolian harp.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Her husband sat and held her hand, never moving, scarcely breathing,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">lest he should disturb her long, deep sleep. He sat there more than an</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">hour. The room grew dark with the shades of evening; and when at length</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Catherine entered with the night lamp, he raised his hand with a sign of</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">silence and caution, murmuring—</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“She has fallen asleep.” Catherine approached quietly, shading the lamp</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">with her hand, and looked upon the sleeper. “Hush, be very cautious—do</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">not disturb her,” whispered Frank.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">The sweet and solemn voice of Catherine gently arose, saying, “Come</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">away, Captain Fairfax. Nothing will ever disturb her more. She has</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">fallen asleep in Jesus.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>

<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Two months have passed since the death of the sisters. To the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">consternation of the _haut ton_ of the city, the beautiful Mrs. Clifton</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">has left Richmond, and come down to mourn with those that mourn at White</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Cliffs. With an air at once of earnest conviction and graceful</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">weariness, she says that it is “All vanity and vexation of spirit,”</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">meaning fashionable society, spring traveling, and sight seeing; summers</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">at watering places among the mountains, or by the sea-side; winters in</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">town, with plays, concerts, balls, dressing, visiting and waltzing;</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">autumn parties in the country-houses, with equestrian expeditions,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">sailing excursions, and forest rides and drives, and even the moonlight</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">serenades, and “the slight flirtation by the light of the chandelier.”</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Mrs. Georgia speaks the truth. “Vanity” all this undoubtedly is in</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">_her_. But _entres nous_, the “vexation of spirit” appertains to certain</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“small” accounts, ranging from fifty to fifteen hundred dollars, and</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">sent in by landlords, merchants, jewelers, milliners, etc., people so</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">wanting in delicate perception, as not to see that the honor of the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">belle’s custom was quite payment enough in itself for their goods, and</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">so utterly destitute of classic lore, and the faculty of distinguishing</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">persons, as actually to draw out on a piece of paper a list of items</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">opposite to a row of figures, with a sum total at the bottom, and send</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">it to a Circe, as if she were a tradesman, and could understand it!</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Charming Georgia did not even try to comprehend such mysterious</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">hieroglyphics. She knew, bewitching creature! that “where ignorance is</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">bliss, ’tis folly to be wise.” Therefore, to escape duns, to recruit</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">health and spirits, and, of all things, to console Major Clifton, she</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">has come down to White Cliffs. The beautiful Georgia presented herself</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">to the mourning master of White Cliffs in a very deprecating spirit—she</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">said that she felt her arrival there at such a moment to be almost an</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">intrusion, but that he would excuse it, as she had exhausted money and</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">credit, and had no other home.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“You know,” she added, as the tears suffused her large, dark eyes, “I am</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">like the unjust steward of the parable, ‘I cannot work—to beg I am</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">ashamed.’”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Except instead of being unjust, you suffer from the injustice of</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">others,” said Archer Clifton, very gently. He said that he considered</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">the entail, which cut off the widow from any share in the landed estate</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">of her deceased husband, very unjust and cruel. He knew that his uncle</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">had deeply regretted it, and would have left all his personal property</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">to her, had it not been swallowed up by debt. He said that he _himself_</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">deplored the circumstance, and if it were legally in his power, he would</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">divide the land with her, but that he only held it in entail, and as</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">entire as it came to him it must be held for his heirs. He added, that</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">he considered it his duty to compensate his uncle’s widow for the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">injustice of the law to her, and that the case being so, she would find</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">thirty thousand dollars placed to her account in the Bank of Richmond.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Mrs. Georgia was overcome with emotion at this generosity on the part of</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Major Clifton. She put her handkerchief to her eyes, and arose</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">hurriedly, with every mark of extreme agitation, exclaiming—</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“No, no—this is too much! too good! only lend me the shelter of this</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">roof—once my home—until I look about me and consider what to do.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">He took her hand, with every demonstration of the tenderest affection</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">and respect, and pressed it to his lips, and begged her to consider</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">herself as heretofore, mistress of the establishment for as long as she</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">wished—for her whole life, if she pleased—and himself only as her</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">sometime guest—adding, that it was impossible he should ever bring</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">another lady there. She withdrew her handkerchief from her eyes, and</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">glancing at him with a countenance eloquent with gratitude, respect, and</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">affection, exclaimed—</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“_I_ take a large portion of your personal property, and _I_ turn you</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">from your home! Oh! no, no, no, thou thrice noble and generous man, no!</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Not one dollar of that money will I touch, so help me Heaven! And not</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">one hour will I stay under this roof, if the master of the house is to</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">be only my ‘sometime guest!’ No! I—I—I must go back to the city, and</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">give lessons in drawing and painting, as befits the artist’s daughter.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“And as does _not_ befit my uncle’s widow, lady!” said Archer Clifton,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">again taking her hand. “I have considered myself in some sort your</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">guardian and protector—if you will admit the claim. Now, listen to me</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">calmly, and act reasonably, for we of White Cliffs are not accustomed to</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">be opposed by the ladies of our family. Hear me, then: This money, which</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">I have placed to your account, is rightfully yours. I will explain. It</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">was the fortune of my dearest Carolyn—” here his voice faltered, he</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">paused a moment, during which Georgia pressed his hand, and looked in</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">his face with an expression of unspeakable sympathy—then he resumed,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">calmly, “Had she died unmarried, and during her father’s lifetime, this</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">money would have reverted to him, and he would doubtless have left it to</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">you. I only give you that which, but for me, might have reached you more</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">directly. And now let that subject rest forever.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Ah, but best and most generous of friends, I drive you from your home</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">by staying here! I cannot stay! I must depart!”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“You must not, Mrs. Clifton—this is your proper home, as it is also</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">mine. You do not drive me hence—why should you? Could I possibly remain,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">your company would be the dearest solace I could have. No! it is memory</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">that drives me hence, sweet friend! I must—I _must_ forget myself in</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">distant lands! Forgive me for talking thus—to be quite plain, as soon as</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">the intricate affairs of this estate are disentangled, and wound up, I</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">design to set out for two or three years of travel; yet I shall not be</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">able to get off for several weeks.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Here the conversation ended for the present. Thinking that for the first</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">few days, at least, Mrs. Georgia would need a female companion, he got</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">in his chaise, and went ever to Hardbargain for Catherine.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Kate is not here,” said Mrs. Clifton, in answer to his inquiries—“do</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">you not know that she has been for three weeks at her brother’s cabin,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">nursing his wife through her confinement?”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Major Clifton threw his hat upon the table, and dropped himself into a</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">chair, with an air of extreme vexation, saying—</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“It really seems to me that that girl is nurse and servant-in-general to</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">the neighborhood! Her brother might easily have found some old woman to</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">nurse his wife. I wonder you permit her to be made such a slave of by</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">everybody, mother.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“It does her no harm, Archer.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Twelve months since you introduced Catherine into the best society in</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Richmond.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“The richest, you mean—not the best, by a great deal.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“And now you suffer her to throw herself into the most vulgar and</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">common! Dear madam, is this right?”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“‘What God hath cleansed, call not thou common, or unclean’—yes! it is</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">right! Catherine, a girl of the very humblest birth, with natural talent</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">and acquired accomplishments that fit her for any circle—should mix with</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">all. And, Archer, what do you mean by ‘vulgar?’ If ignoble minds,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">corrupt hearts, and mean actions constitute vulgarity—then I for one</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">have met more vulgar people in so-called high-life than ever I saw in</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">low-life!”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“My dear mother, you are a Republican—let us waive this discussion, for</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">I dislike to differ from you, and tell me where I shall find Catherine,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">for she positively must return with me to White Cliffs, to bear Mrs.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Georgia company, until some other companion can be procured for her.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Catherine is at her brother’s cabin, as I told you.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“The same cabin he occupied before I left home?”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Certainly.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Major Clifton entered the gig, and turned the horse’s head towards the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">dell in which the overseer’s cabin stood. When he drew up before the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">door, Carl came out to welcome him, and invite him to alight.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“No, thank you, send Catherine hither,” he said—</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Carl looked very much as though he did not intend to obey this haughty</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">behest—but Catherine had already heard the demand, and appeared at the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">door.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“How-do-you-do, Kate? Mrs. Georgia Clifton is at my house, and I wish</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">you to return with me to attend upon her. Come, get your bonnet, at</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">once, Catherine, for I am rather hurried.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“We cannot spare Catherine, sir,” said Carl, in a tone of displeasure.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“I did not address myself to you, my good fellow,” said Major Clifton,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">looking over his head, and through the door of the cabin, watching</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Catherine, as she tied on her bonnet.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">When Kate same out, he handed her into the gig, and nodding carelessly</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">to the flushed, indignant Carl, drove off. When they had driven a little</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">way—</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Catherine,” he said, “is that man your full brother?”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Yes, sir.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“The same father and mother?”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Yes, sir.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Humph! You are not at all alike in feature. Are you very much attached</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">to this brother, Catherine?”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Yes, sir.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Humph.” He did not speak again until they had reached White Cliffs,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">when he handed her out, and said—“Catherine, Mrs. Georgia is greatly</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">fatigued; I wish you to attend to her comforts, this evening—do you</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">hear?”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Yes, sir,” replied Kate.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">The next day Mrs. Clifton, of Hardbargain, came over to call on Georgia.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">And afterwards, at the earnest solicitation of her son, she paid them a</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">visit of a week. Major Clifton busied himself with the settlement of the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">estate. Although the great debts of the late Mr. Clifton could not be</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">recovered of him, he determined to pay them all. A great many of them he</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">discharged at once, by cash; and in payment of others, he gave notes,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">bearing interest. The calling in of these numerous debts, and the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">arrangement of the terms of payment, and other matters, occupied him</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">nearly two months, so that it was the last of autumn before he was ready</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">to set out on his journey.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">He had taken leave of his mother the evening previous to the day upon</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">which he was to leave home. The next morning, in parting from Mrs.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Georgia and Catherine, he took leave of the lady, in a tender and</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">respectful manner, raising her hand to his lips—but he drew Kate to his</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">bosom, and pushing back the rippling waves of chestnut hair, that</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">concealed or shaded two-thirds of her massive forehead, he said, gravely</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">and sweetly—</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“What are you going to do with all this brain while I am gone, Kate? How</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">much longer will it lie fallow? Well! Never mind!” He kissed her freely</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">and fondly as a near relative might, and bowing once more to Mrs.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Georgia, hastened away. He paused upon the threshold of the door</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">however, seemed to hesitate, then suddenly came back, seized the hand of</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Kate, and drew her out upon the porch. “Catherine,” he said, “do you</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">remember a promise you made me once—not to marry without my consent?”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Yes, sir, I remember it.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“I hold you to that promise, Kate. I must speak plainly to you at the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">risk or the certainty of wounding your feelings; yours is a singular</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">position, Catherine—a girl of humble birth, quite penniless, yet with</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">education and accomplishments that fit her to grace a higher circle. It</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">is not likely, Catherine, that any gentleman in this part of the country</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">will ever become a suitor for your hand, and no one who is not a</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">gentleman should be permitted to do so!—Therefore, Catherine, I wish you</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">to promise me not to listen to any proposals without my consent.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“I promised you long ago, sir. I will keep that promise until you</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">release me from it!”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“That is a good girl! Now, then, once more good-bye,” and again he</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">folded her to his bosom, and then, indeed, he was gone.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Catherine turned with the intention of seeking her own room, but was</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">instantly confronted by Mrs. Georgia Clifton, who stood before her with</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">pallid cheek, set teeth, and gleaming eyes. She caught the wrist of the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">girl, and keeping a strong, vice-like grasp upon it, dragged her almost</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">with violence into the parlor before the window, and casting herself</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">into a chair, pulled Catherine up before her, and fixed those wild,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">dilated, star-like eyes upon her face. It fell blushing under the gaze.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“You love that man,” she said, drawing her breath hardly, like one in a</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">passing pain.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">The blush deepened upon Catherine’s cheek, but she did not reply in</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">words.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Speak! Answer me! You love that man?” she repeated, clutching the wrist</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">of the girl so tightly as to cause her to wince.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Madam, I am grateful to Major Clifton—he is my benefactor—he cares for</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">me, and I am grateful to him.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“He is an arrogant man—he reminded you of your low birth.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“I know he did, madam, and perhaps I ought to have vindicated our common</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">human nature, and told him, as I tell you now, that there is no such</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">thing in God’s universe as low birth, that every child comes into His</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">world with equal claim upon His people; perhaps it was my duty to have</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">told him this, only I am always a coward before Major Clifton, and never</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">can say the right thing at the right time to _him_, as I can to others.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“You love him! That is the reason! And you are a fool if you do not know</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">it, or a hypocrite if, knowing it, you deny it. But he _despises_ your</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">love! He said to you, himself, that no _gentleman_ would be likely to be</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">a suitor for your hand!”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“I know he did, lady. His care for me makes him say rough, blunt things</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">sometimes. I can bear them from him.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“You love him! Deny it, if you dare! But you are an idiot! an idiot! if</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">you do not take _his hint_ to conquer that passion! He said it was not</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">likely that any gentleman would ever become a suitor for your hand! _he_</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">is a gentleman—therefore he can never stoop to _you_! You do not answer</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">me! Do you, perchance, deceive yourself with the idea that he ever</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">will?”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Lady—_no_, I do not deceive myself with the idea that he will ever</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">‘stoop’ to marry me. The woman that Major Clifton shall marry, if he</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">ever marries, will be quite worthy of him, and that will preclude the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">idea of his ‘stooping’ to her.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“And that woman will not be _you_, presumptuous girl. Do you dare to</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">hope it will? Speak! Answer me!”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Lady!” said Catherine, in a tone of grave and dignified rebuke,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“considering the recent bereavement of Major Clifton, the discussion</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">into which you have drawn me is indelicate, to use no harsher term!”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“‘Recent!’ It is of five months’ standing! You evade my question! You</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">evade _all_ my questions! I asked you if you loved him! Answer me!”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Lady! long ago my heart became too unruly for my own management, and I</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">gave it, with all its desires and affections, to God. I love nothing out</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">of Him!”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“And do you expect Archer Clifton will ever marry you? Answer that!”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Madam, I expect nothing.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Do you hope it, then?”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Lady, I hope nothing.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“You prevaricate, girl! Do you _wish_ it then?”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Madam, I only wish that God may appoint all times, seasons and events</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">in my life—making me humble, generous and grateful in prosperity, if it</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">comes; and strong, courageous and patient in adversity, if, as is most</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">likely, _that_ comes!”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Humph—would it make you happy to be the wife of Archer Clifton?”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Mrs. Clifton, you have no right to ask me that question!”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Yet I _do_ ask you, and I insist upon a reply!”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“And I decline giving it.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“I am answered! You love Archer Clifton! You feed your heart upon the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">secret hope of one day being his wife! And now listen to me, girl!” she</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">exclaimed, every vestige of prudence and self-restraint swept away by</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">her rising passion, “_I, too_, day and night, feed my soul upon one</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">desperate hope—that I live for, would die for, or go to perdition for!</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">_I, too_, love Clifton. I loved him the first hour I ever saw him. I</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">have loved him ever since, only more madly for every obstacle, danger,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">_duty_ that stood between, dividing us! I have schemed, dared, _sinned_</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">for him! Twice he has been snatched from me by fate, twice restored to</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">my hopes! Oh! I know my own strong will had much to do with that</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">restoration! He is given to my hopes again! Think you, _now_, that you</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">can win him from me? _No_, idiot! If there be any power in my own soul,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">on earth, in Heaven, or in hell to help me, I will find it out, and</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">enlist it to give me this one desire of my heart, this man’s love! Since</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">first I ever beheld his face, I have dreamed, hoped, toiled, _lived_ for</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">nothing else! I have suffered for him! Oh! angels and devils! how I have</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">suffered for him! In the days when he came wooing Carolyn, wooing her</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">before the face of _me_, bound with indissoluble chains!—me, loving him</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">as _she_ had no power or conception of loving anything! Many times I was</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">almost mad with despair!—knowing, too, if he would only love me I should</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">be nearly mad with joy! I have sacrificed great prospects for him. Yes!</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">little as you think me capable of it! This summer I might have made a</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">splendid alliance in Richmond—a traveling nobleman—an English nobleman,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">girl! a baron with an annual rental of thirty thousand pounds</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">sterling—with seats in the three kingdoms, and a palace in Portman</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Square. I rejected him, when I knew that Clifton was free! In the faint</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">hope of winning Clifton, I would not bind myself. All that I have ever</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">done of good or of evil has had him for its end and object! I was the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">belle, queen, _idol_ of Richmond. If I schemed and toiled for a</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">position, and gloried in my success, it was that _he_ might hear of it,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">and his pride might be enlisted for me! You saw me one winter at the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">governor’s reception! You saw how I was worshiped there! But _he_ was</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">present—and free, and I did not care what the thousands thought of me, I</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">only cared what that unit might think!” Her voice sank into tenderness,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">and she paused, and dropped her brow into both open hands. But soon</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">raising her head again, she said, “Look at me well! Ay, look! What sort</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">of a rival do you take me to be? If you cannot guess, I will tell you! I</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">am not superstitious or scrupulous, as you are! I am one, who, for my</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">soul’s great passion, will do, or dare, or suffer anything! I ask no</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">leave of earth or Heaven for what I do! I do what I will, or _can_, and</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">take the consequences; earth or Heaven can but punish, and I can risk or</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">bear it!—for there is no pain or loss in the universe that I weigh with</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">the loss of my love! And not for the fear of eternal perdition—not for</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">the hope of everlasting salvation, will I forego the joy of my mortal</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">love! Now, hear me, girl!” She rose upon her feet, bending over</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Catherine, with her hand clutched upon the maiden’s shoulder with a</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">vice-like grip, and, gazing into her eyes with contracted, gleaming</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">pupils, she said,—while her voice dropped into the low, deep, stern tone</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">of intense and concentrated passion, in which every word, syllable,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">letter was articulated with a distinct, metallic ring:—“Now, hear me! If</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">you dare to come between me and my love—by the living Lord that sent my</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">burning soul upon this dull earth, and who can hurl it hence to a</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">burning perdition—I will find a way to kill you! Do you hear me?”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Catherine grew pale beneath the tiger eye and clutch of the fearful</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">woman, but she answered—</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Madam, I have heard you utter wild and wicked words. I will endeavor to</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">forget them.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Remember them! You are warned!”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">And releasing her hold, the dark lady passed from the room.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Catherine remained sitting where she had left her, appalled by the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">exhibition of demoniac passion she had witnessed. One pain and one fear</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">possessed her above all others—deep regret that this most wicked woman</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">had evidently already attained such an ascendancy over the mind of</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Clifton, and dread lest, in despite of all the sin, she would gain her</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">object—his hand! But Catherine carried all her doubts and fears to her</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Heavenly Father. And soon to her clear, strong mind it became evident,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">that however wicked and unscrupulous, potent and dangerous the Circe</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">might be on ordinary occasions, she possessed too little</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">self-government, was under the influence of too strong and impetuous</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">passions, to succeed in maintaining any long course of duplicity, such</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">as would be necessary to the accomplishment of her purpose. And Kate</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">became calm. She wished to leave the house. She could ill bear to live</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">under the same roof with this woman, and meet her at least three times a</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">day, at meals, if no oftener. But she had promised Major Clifton to</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">remain with Mrs. Georgia until she should have other company, and she</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">must keep her promise. It was, besides, doubly sacred, being made to</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">him, and the pain it brought her was endurable—borne for him.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Mrs. Georgia sought the garden, the open air, anywhere where she could</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">breathe freely. When the storm in her bosom had subsided, and reason was</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">again in the ascendant, she could have torn her hair and beat her</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">breast, yea, and rent her garments with excess of chagrin, to think that</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">she had so betrayed herself to Catherine. She did not fully believe that</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Catherine would repeat this scene where it could injure her, or</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">anywhere, in fact. Still, she thought it safer to guard against such a</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">contingency, and while _she herself_ still possessed the unshaken</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">confidence and respect of Major Clifton, to impugn the conduct and</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">character of Catherine, and thus forestall and invalidate any testimony</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">she might hereafter give. She felt that she must proceed very</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">cautiously. A plan of correspondence had been arranged with Major</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Clifton, previous to his departure. She soon began to receive long</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">letters from him, filled with interesting descriptions of the countries</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">through which he passed, the people whom he met, and philosophical</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">comments upon both. And to these she replied in other letters, full of</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">appreciation, admiration, gratitude, and breathing, besides, the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">highest, purest, most disinterested sentiments and opinions upon all the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">subjects of their correspondence. Into these letters, she gradually</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">introduced the name of Catherine—carelessly, at first, as if she thought</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">little about her, one way or the other,—as thus: “Catherine is with me</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">still—she desires to be remembered;” then, in a second letter, by a</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">slight line of praise, as though the girl was rather winning upon her,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">as—“Catherine is well. By the way, what a remarkably clever girl she</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">is;” then, in another, with warmer panegyric, as though she really very</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">much improved upon longer acquaintance, thus: “How can I ever thank you</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">sufficiently for placing Catherine with me?” Next came high encomiums</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">upon Catherine’s talents, in this wise: “Catherine has left me, and is</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">with your mother, as no doubt the latter has written you. Apropos! What</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">a mind that girl has! Did you ever observe?” And then, in a subsequent</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">epistle, came an expression of wonder at the “diplomatic” character of</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Kate’s intellect, and an opinion that the writer really believed her</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">thrown away in private life. And next, a cooler mention of the maiden,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">with the hint of a fear that she was gaining the mastery over Mrs.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Clifton’s strong mind. Finally, after some months, she wrote thus, as if</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">speaking frankly from a sense of duty, and at the cost of great pain: “I</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">fear that I have been greatly deceived in my estimate of Catherine’s</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">good principles. How shall I introduce what I am about to say to you?</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">But you had best come home and see for yourself. For I know that your</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">mother is in the power of as dangerous an intriguante as I ever heard</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">of; and mind—she will influence Mrs. Clifton to disinherit her own son,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">and bequeath _her_ the farm at Hardbargain. That ‘Maria Teresa’ brow of</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">hers meant something, after all. But you do not know with what pain I</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">write this, Archer! I cannot pursue the subject—only regard for you, and</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">fidelity to your interests, would have drawn me to its discussion. I</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">advise you to come home and look after your own welfare!”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">What influence this had upon Major Clifton, will be seen in the sequel.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">And while Georgia was exercising her power abroad, she was busy at home</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">also. Having heard or guessed at Colonel Conyer’s “foolish” attachment</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">to Catherine, she wrote and invited him to make up a party of his own</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">friends, and come down and spend Christmas with her. And the gallant</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">officer, delighted with this quintessence and perfection of confidence</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">and hospitality—this _carte blanche_ to be filled up at his own</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">pleasure, wrote and most gratefully accepted the invitation for himself</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">and “friends.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>

<p class="p3"><span class="s2"><span class="Apple-converted-space">                             </span>CHAPTER XXVII.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2"><span class="Apple-converted-space">                               </span>CATHERINE.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2"><span class="Apple-converted-space">                </span>Now has descended a serener hour—KEATS.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Colonel Conyers exercised tact and discretion in availing himself of the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">privilege granted him by Georgia. In consideration of the recent</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">affliction of the family, he made up a very quiet and appropriate</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">party—namely, the lady’s father, the artist, a pale young clergyman who</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">was suffering for country air, and the wife and sister of the latter.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">After his arrival at White Cliffs, Mrs. Georgia gave him every</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">opportunity of renewing his acquaintance with Catherine, and every</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">encouragement to persist in his suit. Girls, she said, were often</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">whimsical, and Catherine was especially shy, but disposed to think</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">highly of her suitor, and well worth the trouble of perseverance.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Colonel Conyers thereupon grew importunate, and Catherine became</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">distressed at his persistance, and announced her intention of returning</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">to Hardbargain. When her lover heard this, his grief seemed unbounded—he</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">had so long counted on success, so long been deceived by Mrs. Georgia’s</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">assurances, and by Catherine’s gentleness of denial, that now when his</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">hopes were quite overthrown, he became passionate and vehement in his</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">demonstrations of sorrow. His trouble affected Catherine very deeply.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">She went and sat down by him, and laid her hand upon his shoulder, and</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">said, in her gentle sympathetic tones—</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Do not grieve so; indeed I am not worth so much love or so much</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">regret—indeed I am not—I am a poor girl, very ignorant of society, very</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">full of weakness and error.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Oh, Catherine! Catherine! that is nothing to the purpose! You are what</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">you are, and I adore you! Do not make me wretched.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Heaven knows I do not wish to! I am your friend—_indeed_ I am. I would</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">do anything in the world to give you peace, indeed I would—except—”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Except love me, proud girl!”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“‘Proud?’ No, I am not proud. Why should I be? Do not mock me! Indeed I</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">feel that you have conferred the greatest honor upon me in your</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">preference. An offer of his hand is the highest mark of respect and</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">confidence a man can give a woman; the world would think it higher</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">still, coming from one of your rank to one of mine. I myself should in</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">any case be proud of your regard, only—”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Well? ‘Only?’”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Only I feel so grieved to see you look so sorrowfully; but—”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Well, my dear girl, well! but what?”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">She paused, a slight blush suffused her cheek—she gathered courage and</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">went on to say—</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“I do not know why I should not speak anything that may be upon my</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">heart, at whatever cost to my natural feelings, if the hearing of it</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">will do good to any human being. Yes! I will speak, for your sake. I do</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">not fear to speak, for I have perfect confidence in you. Listen then,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Colonel Conyers, dear friend. You are not the only one who has missed</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">earthly happiness. I think it must be written in the book of fate, that</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">we may not have those whom we love too deeply—in other words, that we</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">may not have idols. It seems to me, that notwithstanding all other</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">troubles, it would make us too happy, in an existence designed chiefly</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">for trial and probation.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“That is a sad, strange, despairing sentiment, for one so young!”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“No, not despairing—for if we may not have joy, there remain the peace</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">and cheerfulness found in duty. And if we may not have the love of the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">heart’s idol, there remain the affection of relatives, the esteem of</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">friends, the love of God, and the hope of Heaven.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Catherine, you have loved. Tell me about it my child.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“I intended to tell you about it. It is the best proof of entire</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">confidence and esteem that I can give you. It will show you how highly I</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">value you, and it will assure you also, of the utter impossibility of</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">getting a heart that is not mine to give—if it were worth giving.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">She paused in great embarrassment, her cheeks were suffused with</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">blushes, yet she seemed resolved to proceed. As if to assist her, he</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">said—</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“This being whom you deify with your love, my child! what a splendid,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">what a magnificent nature he must have! what transcendant personal</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">attractions! what an intellect! what a heart! Is it not so? tell me!”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Ah! no; you are mistaken; these things excite admiration and wonder,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">they do not of themselves win affection. Oh, no! he of whom you speak,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">is not so handsome as you are; he has no more mind than you have, and</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">not so much heart—even _I_ admit that.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“And yet you love him, and can love him.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Even so—do you wonder at it? Have not you passed by women—handsome,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">graceful, accomplished—to fix upon a plain country girl like me?”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Oh, but not women with your candor, purity and strength of mind. Oh,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Kate! what depths of truth and innocence you have revealed in the very</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">confession you have made me! Who else but yourself dared make such a</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">revelation?”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Catherine looked up at the speaker in doubt.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Go on, dear girl. Tell me that this man adores you, and I will never,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">while I live, trouble you with myself again.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Ah, no! it was nothing like that which I set out to tell you. Ah, no! I</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">only wished to let you know—that your case of disappointed affection is</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">not solitary—that I too have missed life’s crowning joy—the love of one</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">I love. He does not even notice me now. I never permit myself to dream</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">that he will ever love me. Yet I would like to live with him, to serve</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">him—myself unknown, unnoticed, if I might only be near him. I envy the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">waiting-maids and men, and even the dogs, who are full-feasted every</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">day, with the presence for which my heart starves. I would like to give</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">my life to his service, but I am unnecessary to his smallest need. Well!</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">I cannot do him any good; but I serve one who is dear to him, and so I</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">stay the hunger of my heart. Please do not think ill of me for telling</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">you all this. It would grieve me to have you think any evil of me. I</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">esteem you, and want your esteem. I have done some violence to my</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">instincts in telling you this. Do not think ill of me for doing so. I</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">only do it that you may know you are not the only one in the world who</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">is——_not happy_.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Think ill of you, Catherine! Do anything but adore you—and mourn your</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">loss forever—if lose you I must—oh, Heaven!”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“This life is a tragedy—for always that which is dearest, is lost in it,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">and it ends in death. The closing scene is the corpse, the shroud, the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">coffin—and the curtain drops upon the grave—all beyond is hidden—except</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">to the eye of faith. My experience of life has been all darkness, clouds</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">and storm—and the transient gleams of gladness or of hope have been—not</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">like the sunshine, but like the lightning. Yet through all the grief,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">and gloom, and the tempting doubt, the ‘still, small voice’ of God’s</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">spirit has spoken to my soul, and comforted me.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Oh, Catherine, my child! that I could make your life all sunshine—that</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">you would let me try—I do believe I could make you happy.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Catherine shook her head, slowly, with a sad smile, saying—</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“We all believe that! We all think that in _us only_ is vested the power</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">of making those we love happy. It is because we know that we are</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">willing, anxious to do more for them than any other person would! It is</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">a fond error. Our efforts—our greatest sacrifices are often needless, as</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">we ourselves are nothing to our gods of flesh.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Am I nothing—nothing to you, then?”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“You are my dear and honored friend.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Oh, Catherine, I could make your life happy! Nay, but do not look</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">incredulous—I know I _could_. My love is not selfish, like that of most</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">other men. It is perfectly disinterested. It only asks to serve you. It</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">only desires to see you at ease. Dear Kate, you have told me all on your</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">heart—you might lay that heart, with all its burden of unrequited</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">affection, upon my bosom, and I would comfort, and cherish, and sustain</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">it, until I should win its love all to myself.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Again, and more mournfully, the girl shook her head—</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Do not pursue this subject, Colonel Conyers. Dear friend, by dwelling</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">upon our wild wishes, they grow to seem hopes, and probabilities, and</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">certainties. In my youth—”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“In ‘your youth’? How many years ago was that, Catherine?”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Strange!—but at eighteen, I really feel no longer young.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Yet it is not winter, but a wintry spring, that chills your young life.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">That is not uncommon. Spring—the spring of hope, the spring of joy, the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">spring of life will open indeed by-and-by, and be all the warmer and</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">brighter for its lateness—and my Catherine shall feel younger—but for</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">increased wisdom—at twenty-five, then she does now at eighteen—that lot</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">is for her—whosesoever treasure she may be. But what was she going to</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">say happened in her long passed youth?”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Catherine smiled, and said—</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Well, then—when life was newer and fresher, believing—as I do now—all</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">the promises of the Bible—and saying—as I do now—that the days of</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">miracles are not passed, and never will be so, until the days of God’s</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">omnipotence and man’s faith is passed, I used to say that I would pray</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">for what I wanted, though the granting of my prayer should seem to</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">involve an impossibility. But now, later in life, I have learned a</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">better lesson still, from the example of my Master. He might have saved</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Himself by a miracle, but He chose rather to endure the cross and the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">shame, for the working out of His Father’s will and purpose. God has a</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">purpose and a will in every—the humblest life. And now, for all other</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">vain and childish petitions, I substitute the words of the Saviour—‘Not</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">My will—but Thine, be done.’”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Catherine, you must be happy, even in this world. You are so good. You</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">must be made happy in the end.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Ah, I should be sorry to set up the plea of goodness—when I see so many</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">people so much better than I am, suffer so deeply. It is too often</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">represented that goodness is rewarded in this world—but, oh! how can any</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">one remember the life and death of a thousand martyrs, and the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">crucifixion of the Saviour, and not feel that it is not so—and not feel</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">that the reverse is often so!”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Oh, Catherine, that is a very gloomy doctrine, and I will not believe</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">it! There is a hopeful text of Scripture that comes into my</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">mind—‘Godliness is profitable in all things, having the promise of the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">life that _now is_, and that which is to come.’ It is the clouds of your</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">wintry spring that make everything look so gloomy to you!”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“It is not a gloomy doctrine! Oh, no! not gloomy, by all the hope and</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">illumining of the glorious Resurrection and Ascension.”</span></p>

<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Catherine returned to Hardbargain on Christmas Eve. It was a clear,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">cold, crisp afternoon, and the level sun threw a glistening, yellow</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">lustre, like powdered gold dust, over the crusted surface of the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">snow-clad earth. And as Kate’s little, rough-coated pony stepped freely</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">out over the ground, life and hope and joy tided back to her heart,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">giving bloom to her cheeks, light to her eyes, and elasticity to all her</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">motions. She was very glad indeed to find herself on her way to the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">farm, and about to exchange the feverish, exciting atmosphere of White</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Cliffs, and the disturbing proximity of Georgia, for the long, calm</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">days, and long, calm evenings with Mrs. Clifton, at the farm-house. She</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">reached her destination at dusk. Mrs. Clifton met the girl with a smile</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">of pleasure, and welcomed her with a kiss of affection. Then she</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">conducted her into the parlor, where she made her sit down by the fire,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">while she removed her bonnet and shawl. Next she summoned Henny, and</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">gave orders that tea should be served immediately, and a fire kindled in</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Miss Catherine’s room, as the young lady was fatigued, and would wish to</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">retire early. There was in the manner of the lady upon this evening, and</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">from this evening, a maternal tenderness and solicitude, very soothing</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">and delightful to Catherine. This was so apparent to the domestics, that</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">they began to deport themselves towards the maiden with the deference</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">due to the daughter of the house.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">And how calmly and cheerfully the winter days passed. There was the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">early rising, and the early breakfast, in the warm, bright, back parlor,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">where the morning sun shone in. There was the leisurely talk over the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">meal, about the occupations, which were also the amusements of the day.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">After breakfast, came the ride around the farm, in the course of which</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">every field and barn and granary was inspected, and every negro quarter</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">visited. And during these rides, Mrs. Clifton gave Catherine much</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">information relating to agricultural matters.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“For, my dear,” she said, “some day you may be a planter’s wife, and</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">have all these things to look after, while your husband is in the public</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">service, absent with his regiment, or at the legislature.” To which</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Catherine ventured no reply. And then came dinner, and the short</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">afternoon nap, and tea, and the long, serene evening by the fireside,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">employed in needle-work, enlivened by rational, cheerful conversation,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">and occasionally varied by music or reading, and finally ended by family</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">prayer and bed.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Mrs. Clifton and Catherine never, never wearied of each other. They had</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">many occupations for hands and heads—they were both strong, original</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">thinkers, and above all, were both deeply interested in the same</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">being—the absentee.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">And now Catherine enjoyed a very dear, but dangerous delight, in the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">perusal of Major Clifton’s letters of travel. These letters arrived</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">about two in a month. And, ah! the evenings, when they came, were</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">festivals indeed to the recluse lady and the maiden. Often when one was</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">brought in, Mrs. Clifton reclining, through weakness, upon the sofa,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">shading her eyes with her hand, would say, “Break the seal and read it</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">to me, dear Catherine.” And Kate would do so—drawing delicious draughts</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">of perilous pleasure from the poetic and artistic spirit that pervaded</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">every sentiment, narrative and description in the epistle. And on these</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">long, quiet winter evenings, very often the conversation turned upon the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">absent son—the dear topic always introduced by his mother. It seemed as</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">if Mrs. Clifton wished to make Catherine thoroughly acquainted with his</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">character and disposition—with his faults and weaknesses, as well as</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">with his virtues and powers.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“My son has his serious imperfections, like other men, of course—though</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">your eyes contradict me, Catherine; if I, his partial mother, see them,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">they exist, you may depend Archer is no demigod, my dear, in the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">estimation of any one, but—well, no matter—don’t blush so—I am his</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">mother, and I love him, too, and think highly of him, of course, but I</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">acknowledge he is no angel, Kate, and I should be sorry you should take</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">him for one—disappointment would come of it, my dear. He is proud,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">jealous, and suspicious as a Spaniard, and while under the influence of</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">these feelings, he is reserved and sullen as an Indian—yet these faults</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">of character have been so transfigured in my dear Kate’s affection, that</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">they have actually seemed virtues—the pride, jealousy and suspicion have</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">seemed high sense of honor and intellectual acumen—and the reserve and</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">sullenness—dignity! Is it not so, my dear?”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Kate’s eyes lighted, and her cheeks flushed highly, but not with</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">bashfulness—with an emotion that was swelling at her heart—and carried</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">away from self-consciousness by enthusiasm, she answered—</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Oh, madam! I know what I would say to you, if I only knew how to say</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">it. Heaven sends divine thoughts and feelings into my heart, and brain</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">sometimes, but they cannot pass thence into words—they are choked up</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">perhaps by sin or imperfection. Such a feeling I have now—heavenly</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">light, if I could only refract it—” She paused an instant, unconscious</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">that the lady was looking intently upon her. Then she spoke again,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">slowly, in a kind of calm fervor—“Real affection—I do not mean passion</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">or imagination—but real love does _never_ invest its object with</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">_un_real virtues!—never!—all faults are the excess or the deficiency of</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">some virtue—well, real love sees its object not perhaps as he is at his</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">worst—not even perhaps so evil as he is even at his best, but as he may</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">become!—as he surely _will_ become, if that real affection continues</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">faithful to its trust. Ah! how strong that conviction is in my heart—how</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">weak upon my lips!”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“I understand you, Catherine, and may your true affection be the divine</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">alchemy that shall transmute all Archer Clifton’s faults into virtues.”</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">At this personal reply, Catherine’s eyes fell and her cheeks burned with</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">sudden self-recollection, and for weeks after this she could not recall</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">the conversation without deep blushes.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">More and more freely as the weeks passed by did Mrs. Clifton talk to</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Kate of her son and his peculiarities, and the best way to meet them.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“You know, my dear Catherine, the apostle, in order to win proselytes,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">made himself all things to all men. Archer is proud, and my dear girl</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">must raise herself a little out of that humility of manner which is very</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">distasteful to the haughty, except when exhibited towards themselves,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">when it naturally becomes very acceptable.” This style of conversation,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">addressed to her for weeks and months, was at once very pleasing and</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">very painful to Kate. It was sweet, it was dear beyond measure, to be</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">considered in this near relation to her beloved, to be addressed daily</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">and hourly as if she possessed the power of rendering his future life</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">better and happier, and so addressed by his own mother, too, but it was</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">also humiliating to be supposed to presume on the future esteem and</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">affection of one who had never addressed the language of love to her.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Often she thought of begging Mrs. Clifton to desist from this style of</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">conversation; but a certain bashfulness, a deep respect for the lady, a</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">distrust of herself and of her own experience, and the childish thought</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">that Major Clifton might have entrusted to his mother an intention that</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">he never confided to herself its object, and the delight of living in</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">this blessed illusion, and the fear of breaking the charm, kept her</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">silent for a long time, during which Mrs. Clifton gradually fell into</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">the manner of considering her and speaking to her as her son’s future</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">wife. All at once one day it suddenly struck Kate that Mrs. Clifton</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">might be the victim of a mistake, and under the impression that some</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">understanding or engagement existed between herself and Major Clifton,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">and that her own silence and seeming acquiescence had served to confirm</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">this error. And this very natural and rational thought fell upon the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">girl like a thunderbolt, utterly blasting and destroying all her</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">beautiful hopes, and covering her face with the blushes of deep</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">humiliation. She felt that she must undeceive Mrs. Clifton immediately.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">So when they sat together at the work-table, before the evening fire,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">and the lady spoke of her son saying, among other things—</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“The most unhappy trait in his character is his tendency to suspicion,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">my love. Be straight-forward with him, Catherine, never have a secret</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">from him, not even one touching a little pleasant surprise, be perfectly</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">frank and openhearted with him, and, alas! even that course may not</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">always save you from suffering by his besetting sin, and when it does</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">not, Catherine, there is nothing left for you but patience and trust.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">You see, on Archer’s behalf, I expect a great deal of you, my love, like</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">all mothers-in-law, I suppose.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Catherine’s face was bent over her work; ashamed of her supposed</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">mistake, ashamed of the weakness that now choked her voice, she remained</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">silent for some time. At length, gathering a false impression from her</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">long continued silence, Mrs. Clifton said—</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Do I hope too much from you, Kate, my love?”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">With an effort, Catherine controlled her emotion, looked up and replied,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">steadily—</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“No, no, dear Mrs. Clifton, you do not demand too much of me. As far as</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">my will and my power, as far as the grace of God aids me, I will serve</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Major Clifton with the affection and fidelity of a sister and a servant,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">but I have not the smallest reason to suppose that he will ever admit me</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">to a friendship sufficiently intimate to make it possible for me to</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">affect his character and conduct in any way, even if I should presume to</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">wish it.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“My dear Kate, Archer’s wife will be his friend, companion and</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">counsellor—he never would be happy with a mere housekeeper or parlor</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">ornament, however beautifully accomplished and amiable—it is therefore</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">he will prize my dear Catherine’s clear, strong mind and proud heart—she</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">will be admitted to his closest thoughts and his noblest counsels, do</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">not doubt it.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Oh, madam, you do not comprehend me yet, I see. How deeply rooted your</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">mistake must be, dear lady! Oh, how shall I tell you? Indeed you are in</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">error if you suppose—if you suppose that—” Kate stopped short and burst</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">into tears.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Mrs. Clifton encircled her waist with her arm, and said—</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Come, Kate, stop all this blushing and weeping. Let us be confidential,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">you and I, as mother and daughter should be, for you are as my own</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">daughter, Kate, and am I not a mother to you?”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Oh, yes! yes! dear lady!” said Catherine, taking her hand, and pressing</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">it to her bosom, and covering it with kisses. “Oh, yes, you are indeed</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">like a mother to me, if I were only worthy to be your daughter! and I</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">love and honor you more than ever a mother was loved and honored in this</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">world before, I do believe!”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Then let there be no reserve between us, dear Kate. Let us be open with</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">each other, as parent and child, whose loves, and hopes, and wishes are</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">the same. I have been plain with you all along, only gradually unfolding</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">your future, not to alarm your shyness—and to win your confidence. I</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">have longed for this confidence—this perfect openness between us—that we</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">might talk with more intelligence, and with more comfort—and I have</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">courted it by my own frankness; but in return for all my candor,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Catherine has shown me only reserve and blushes. Will she be more</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">confiding now?”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Alas, dearest lady, what can I say to you, but that you are greatly</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">mistaken—sadly mistaken—oh, yes, indeed, sadly mistaken,” replied Kate,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">almost weeping again.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“I am not mistaken in supposing that Catherine loves my son. I am not</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">mistaken in knowing that the fact gives me more happiness than anything</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">else in the world. Yet I would like to hear Kate admit it.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Well, dearest lady—yes!—down, pride!—if it will give you any pleasure</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">to hear it, I must not withhold the confession—yes, I _do_ love your</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">son—so much—so much—that it will make me an old maid!”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Mrs. Clifton laughed, a little, low, jolly laugh. (The lady very seldom</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">laughed, and when she did, it had a strange, exceedingly pleasant effect</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">upon the hearer—it was a very agreeable surprise, revealing, as it were</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">under that grave, stern surface, traces of a mine of wit, humor, fun and</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">mischief, that must have existed, and frequently sparkled forth, ere the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">sorrow and the seriousness of life smothered and extinguished it.) She</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">laughed her little, low, jolly laugh, and replied—</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“That were a strange effect of love, Catherine; but trust me, it will</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">not be so with Archer’s consent.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Dear Mrs. Clifton, forgive me for saying again, that you are very much</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">mistaken—never, never in his life, has Major Clifton bestowed upon me</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">one word, or look, that might be misconstrued by the vainest woman into</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">a preference!”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Well, Kate! I know that! I know that he has never addressed you on the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">subject. But I know that he will do so. For he loves you, Catherine, and</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">has loved you from the first hour he ever saw you—even from the—the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">night he sat and studied you in your brother’s cabin. And it is just as</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">certain that you will be his wife, as that you both will live to marry.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">So, dearest, let there be no more reserve between us—consider this</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">marriage sure, as it really is—(so far as any future event is sure)—and</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">let me talk freely, for my time and opportunity is short.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Catherine raised her eyes to the sallow—almost cadaverous face of the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">lady, and a conviction of the truth and reality of what she predicted,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">forced itself upon her, with a sharp pang.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Now, dear Catherine, I did not ask you for that troubled look! Will</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">your heart ache because a dry leaf drops in the autumn, rather than</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">hangs shivering on the tree through half the winter? But, dear child, I</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">allude to this coming event, not to cast its ‘shadow’ over you, but to</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">explain why I wish now to use these days in making you as conversant</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">with the idiosyncracies of your future companion, as only years of</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">married life could do, and to prevent years, perhaps, of</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">misunderstanding and sorrow. There is something dreadful in the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">discovery of unsuspected faults, _after_ marriage—and something very,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">very mournful in the disappointment of the trusting affection, and in</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">the saddened efforts of the heart to adjust itself to the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">circumstances—efforts that in one case out of ten, perhaps, succeed. But</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">if the worst is known before marriage, the man or the woman may consider</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">well whether they have the strength of heart to conquer their own</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">faults, and bear with those of their companion. That you would do all</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">this for your husband, Kate, I am convinced. I only talk now to smooth</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">your path of duty.” The lady here released Catherine from the embrace in</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">which she had held her through this conversation, and desired her to</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">ring for the servants to come in to prayers.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Catherine, as had been her custom for several weeks past—upon account of</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Mrs. Clifton’s weakness—conducted the evening devotions.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">When prayers were over, and the servants dismissed, Catherine attended</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Mrs. Clifton to her chamber, and assisted her with affectionate care</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">until she had retired to bed. Then, after receiving the lady’s parting</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">kiss, she hastened into her own chamber, threw herself upon the bed, and</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">gave way to a long-pent burst of sorrow. Within the last three years</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Catherine had seen much sickness, death, and bereavement—one after</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">another of her associates or relations had faded and fallen, and she had</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">mourned their loss; and her life had taken a sombre hue, and sunken into</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">a depressed tone. But that this beloved friend, this kind benefactress,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">this dear, dear companion—this more than mother, sister, _all_ to her</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">heart—should pass away from the earth and be seen no more! Oh! it</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">brought a sense of desolation that threw a shadow and a chill over all</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">the future—over even the bright hopes shining in the distance. And then</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">the identity of the love she bore mother and son together forced itself</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">upon her heart. And she felt that a union with the son could not give</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">her perfect content, unless the mother were there to share her love and</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">service, and to participate in their happiness. Without that mother’s</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">presence, their plan of life would be unfinished—their circle of love</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">incomplete. And oh! came the sharp, agonizing question, how could she</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">ever bear to lose the light, and warmth, and strength, imparted daily,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">hourly, from that dear face—that face which had never looked on her but</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">in affection—that face, the very image of Clifton’s own, except that it</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">was sweeter, holier, and never, never harsh—how could she ever bear to</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">lose her sweet resting place on that more than maternal bosom—that bosom</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">on which she could ever lay her aching head, or aching heart, in perfect</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">peace and confidence, sure of being understood, sure of being</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">sympathized with? Oh! life would be darkened indeed when she should pass</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">away. The sense of sorrow was so sharp, so agonizing, that the girl</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">could have thrown herself upon the floor—could have wrestled with</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Heaven, in wild prayer, that this life might be saved, and this sharp</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">anguish spared her. But Catherine was habitually self-restrained, and</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">she bore this mental anguish as she would have endured severe physical</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">pain—in silence, in patience, until her soul was subdued to the meekness</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">of resignation. And then prayer brought comfort.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">And she met the lady in the morning with a cheerful countenance. And</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">they spent the day as usual.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">So passed the winter and the spring. Though Mrs. Clifton failed visibly</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">from day to day, she still continued her rides around the farm, and her</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">general supervision of the household and of agricultural affairs, and</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">her instructions to Catherine. Her people, who well knew the nearly</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">hopeless state of her health, foretold that their mistress would keep up</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">and out to the very last—and finally die in her chair. Indeed, while</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">flesh and blood wasted away, her nervous energy seemed unimpaired, and</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">her cheerfulness was undiminished. She talked of her approaching</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">departure as calmly and pleasantly as she would have talked of going to</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Richmond. Never obtruding the subject, however, unless necessity</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">demanded its introduction.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">The serenity and cheerfulness of the lady affected Catherine very</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">beneficially—“familiarizing” to her feelings the future, immortal life.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Catherine endeavored to persuade her to have a physician.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Why, so I would, Kate, if I had any specific disease; but when all the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">frame is wearing out together very slowly and quietly, why call in a</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">doctor to disturb the harmony of natural decay, and painfully build up</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">one portion of the sinking frame at the expense of another? Why not fade</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">and fall easily, as all else in benign nature does?”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Catherine next suggested writing for Major Clifton to hasten home.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Why, my child? Why, because I am going the common road, should others</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">be hurried and worried? Everything in blessed nature and Divine</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Revelation teaches us a sweeter lesson. No—Archer set out for a twelve</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">months’ tour; let him complete it. He will return this autumn. Quite</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">time enough, Catherine. I shall live till then, and longer. I can</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">calculate the progress of my body’s failing, and the duration of my</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">life, with almost mathematical precision. I shall live to meet Archer,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">and to see you married, Catherine—and to leave you willing to survive me</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">and be happy without me. And why not, dear? for shall I not be happier</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">still?”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">And so, in sweet mutual confidence, in cheerful resignation, and in</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">patient hope, the summer passed, and autumn arrived in its glory.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>

<p class="p3"><span class="s2"><span class="Apple-converted-space">                             </span>CHAPTER XXIX.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2"><span class="Apple-converted-space">                              </span>THE RETURN.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2"><span class="Apple-converted-space">                </span>Come home!—there is a sorrowing breath</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2"><span class="Apple-converted-space">                  </span>In music since ye went,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2"><span class="Apple-converted-space">                </span>And fragrant flower scents wander by</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2"><span class="Apple-converted-space">                  </span>With mournful memories blent.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2"><span class="Apple-converted-space">                </span>The tones of every household voice</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2"><span class="Apple-converted-space">                  </span>Are grown more sad and deep—</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2"><span class="Apple-converted-space">                </span>And longing for thee wakes a wish</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2"><span class="Apple-converted-space">                  </span>To turn aside and weep.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2"><span class="Apple-converted-space">                </span>Oh, ye beloved! come home!—the hour</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2"><span class="Apple-converted-space">                  </span>Of many a greeting tone,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2"><span class="Apple-converted-space">                </span>The time of hearth-light and of song</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2"><span class="Apple-converted-space">                  </span>Returns and ye are gone!</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2"><span class="Apple-converted-space">                </span>And darkly, heavily it falls</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2"><span class="Apple-converted-space">                  </span>On the forsaken room,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2"><span class="Apple-converted-space">                </span>Burdening the heart with tenderness</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2"><span class="Apple-converted-space">                  </span>That deepens into gloom.—MRS. HEMANS.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Notwithstanding all her habitual calmness and cheerful patience, Mrs.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Clifton began to grow uneasy at her son’s protracted stay. He had been</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">absent a year and a month. And even now, instead of setting out on his</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">return, he only wrote of coming home soon. At one time he was at Vienna,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">at another at Berlin, then at the Hague, progressing, indeed, but very,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">very slowly towards England and Liverpool, from which port he intended</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">to embark. Every letter that came from him at this period, was opened</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">and read with visible uneasiness by his mother. At length the glad</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">tidings came, a letter from the mid-ocean, brought by a swift sailing</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">packet-boat that had spoken the vessel in which he had embarked. He was</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">hastening home, and might now be expected at any hour. The news</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">contained in his letter excited the invalid so much upon the evening of</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">its reception, that she passed a sleepless night, and rose the next</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">morning weaker than she had ever been before; so weak, indeed, that she</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">was obliged, in coming down stairs, to lean on the arms of Catherine and</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">her maid for support. And when she reached the parlor, she was compelled</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">to recline in an easy-chair, propped up by pillows, and with her feet</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">supported by a foot-cushion. But her cheerfulness was undiminished. She</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">gave many directions as to the adjustment and adornment of the room, and</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">the preparation of certain dainties. Lastly she called Catherine to her</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">side, and took her hand. Catherine did not appear to the best advantage,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">with her plain, dark gingham dress, and her chestnut hair divided simply</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">above her forehead, rippling in tiny wavelets around her broad temples,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">and gathered into a twist behind. This plainness of style did not become</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">her strongly marked features. And the lady saw it, for she gazed</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">thoughtfully upon the girl awhile, and then lifting her hand, disengaged</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">a portion of her tresses from the comb, and let them fall, turning into</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">natural ringlets down her cheeks, saying—</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“There, Catherine, when hair curls naturally and voluntarily, it is</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">certain that the face it belongs to requires it so, and that it should</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">be permitted to follow its nature, for nature does all things well. Why</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">don’t you always wear your hair so? It is so much prettier.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Because, dear lady, I never thought it of any importance how my hair</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">was fixed, so that it looked neat. But I will wear it this way, if it</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">pleases you.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“It does. Your face is not a classic one, dear Kate, and none but a</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">classic face can bear that attic simplicity of style. Your countenance</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">is a very noble one, Kate, but its very nobility is hard and stern,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">without the softening shadow of these ringlets nature has bestowed upon</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">you. There now, look in the mirror, my little Oliver Cromwell, your face</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">is much more womanly than before.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Catherine found it so. The soft, bright, drooping curls shaded and</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">rounded her large, square forehead into beautiful proportion to her</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">other features, and softened the expression of the whole. No girl but is</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">pleased to see herself improved in beauty, and it was with a bright</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">blush, half of pleasure, half of modesty, that the maiden returned to</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">the lady’s side.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Now, dear Kate, you must leave off that dingy gingham, and wear white</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">wrappers in the morning. It is early in the season, and you can wear</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">white a month longer yet, and by the end of that time, I suppose, the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">world will expect you to wear black. You have no white wrappers though,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">my dear!”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“No, madam, I never had one.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Well, you have two white cambric dresses, without ornament, they will</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">do for morning dresses. Do me the kindness to wear them. Nay, now,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Catherine, my dear, no hesitation, I will have it so. Go at once and put</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">on one of them.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Kate complied, and in a short time returned to the parlor—by this change</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">in the style of her toilet, almost transfigured, yet without the loss of</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">her noble characteristics. One thought troubled the maiden, the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">question—What would Clifton think of this? How would he take it? Would</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">he suspect that she had dressed for his eyes? If he did his suspicions</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">would be well founded. And the consciousness of this truth, suffused</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">with blushes the cheeks of the ingenuous girl, and heightened all her</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">beauty.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">There was no certainty of Major Clifton’s advent that day—he might come</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">any day, but nevertheless they hoped for and expected his arrival. By a</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">change in the hours, the stage now reached L—— at noon. And Mrs. Clifton</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">had ordered dinner in the full expectation of having her son’s company</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">at that meal. Nor were their hopes destined to disappointment. A little</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">after one o’clock, the carriage that had been sent to L—— to meet the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">stage, returned and drove up to the door. And Archer Clifton alighted</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">from it, and hastened joyfully into the house. Mrs. Clifton arose to</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">meet him, but, overpowered by agitation and weakness, she sank back into</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">her seat. Her son was before her in an instant, and had clasped her in</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">his arms, and pressed her to his breast, and kissed her fondly many</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">times, and sat her back in her chair to feast his eyes upon her beloved</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">face and form, before he noticed how cadaverous, how death-like, she</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">looked; then a startled expression of surprise and alarm sprung into his</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">countenance, and he turned upon Kate, to whom he had not yet spoken, a</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">glance of mingled inquiry, anger and reproach.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“You find me in poor health, Archer; but not worse, my son, than what</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">might have been expected.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“My dearest mother,” he began, but his voice choked, and to conceal the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">emotion he could not entirely suppress, he turned to Catherine and gave</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">her a brother’s greeting in silence, but at the same time darting into</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">her eyes a look of stern rebuke from his own, which seemed to say, “You,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">at least, should have written and informed me of this.” And the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">suspicions excited by Mrs. Georgia rose darkly in his mind, but were</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">repressed again instantly.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Dearest Archer, I am not usually so ill as I seem to-day. I have never</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">been confined to my bed, or even my chair yet. Only to-day and</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">yesterday, the joy of looking for you has prevented my taking the usual</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">quantity of sleep. I shall be much better to-morrow. Sit down by me and</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">rest, and when you are rested, your room is quite ready for you, if you</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">wish to change your dress before dinner. Catherine, my love, will you go</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">and direct them to serve dinner?”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Catherine left the room and gave the necessary commands. Then she</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">ordered a boy to take Major Clifton’s baggage up into his chamber, and</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">went up stairs to show him where to put it. In the meantime, Major</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Clifton, in looking upon his mother’s wasted form, had lost all</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">self-command, and saying hastily that he thought he would change his</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">traveling dress at once, hurried out of the room to give vent to a</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">passionate sorrow, no longer to be restrained. He ran up stairs, but</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">paused upon the first landing. Catherine, in leaving his room, found him</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">leaning upon the balustrades, with his face buried in his hands, weeping</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">convulsively. To women, there is something really appalling in a man’s</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">tears—we look upon them with more than pity—with awe—with something like</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">the feeling with which Mary and Martha must have witnessed the Saviour’s</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">tears—with deep reverence be it said. Catherine would have crept by and</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">slipped down stairs quietly, for she had a feeling of self-reproach for</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">having even seen that strong outburst of sorrow; but he stood up and</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">seized her hand, and drew her towards him, exclaiming—</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Stop, Catherine! You have seen my weakness! Now, tell me why you did</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">not write to me of this? Cruel and selfish girl! were you so intent upon</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">your own projects, that you could not find time to indite a line to let</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">me know that my mother was dying?”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Another burst of weeping prevented his hearing Catherine’s gentle</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">explanation, that Mrs. Clifton would not permit her to write. And Kate</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">was not anxious to exculpate herself from an unjust charge; indeed,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">after once giving her little, meek explanation, she never thought of it</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">again—she only thought of his agony of regret, and only wished to soothe</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">it. He still held her wrist, unconsciously straining it in the strength</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">of his emotion, until it pained her severely. But she did not care for</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">that, she did not even feel it; she only cared to see him weep so</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">convulsively, and losing all self-consciousness, and with it all</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">reserve, she threw her arm around him, and dropping her head against him</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">most tenderly, most lovingly, she said—</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Oh, do not grieve so! do not! see how calm and cheerful she is! Try to</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">emulate her calmness!”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“I loved her, Kate! I loved her more than ever son loved mother before!</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">She was the worth of life to me! I loved her more than ever I loved</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">human being! More even than I ever loved you, Kate!”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">This was Clifton’s first declaration to Catherine, and a strange time,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">place and circumstances, and a strange method of expressing his</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">preference had fallen upon them. “I loved her more than I ever loved</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">you, Kate!”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">But it did not seem strange to Catherine. It seemed perfectly natural</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">and in order. It did not startle her the least. It did not bring back</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">her womanly self-consciousness, for she answered, meekly—</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“I know it—I know you do. And, oh! don’t _you_ know that I would</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">willingly give my life for hers, if I could restore her, in health, to</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">your affections?”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“And yet you did not even write to let me know she was ill! Oh! girl!</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">girl! you were much to blame for that! It was bitterly wrong.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“I told you, but you did not hear me, that she would not permit me to</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">write; she did not wish to give you pain, or to interfere with your</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">arrangements for the year.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Catherine, that does not excuse you! Could not your own heart have told</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">you how precious, how inestimable to me would have been every hour of</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">her company when her days were numbered? Could you not have written to</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">me secretly?”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“I never did anything secretly in my life. I should never have thought</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">of doing so. Besides, I could not have had a secret from her, so open,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">so frank, so noble as she is. No, I proposed to write for you to come</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">home, I entreated permission to do so, but she refused to grant it, and</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">I deferred to her better judgment. I would not have deceived her for the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">world.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Then I have been unjust and unkind to you, Catherine, but you will</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">pardon me when I tell you—when you see how thoroughly weakened and</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">unmanned I am!”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">The gust of sorrow was over, and Kate, with sudden self-recollection</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">withdrew herself from him, deeply blushing, and hastened down stairs,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">and the thought of her transient self-forgetfulness rendered the girl</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">even shyer than ever.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">He went into his room and refreshed himself with a new toilet. And when</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">he entered the parlor, an hour after, no one would have suspected from</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">his handsome, animated face, the existence of the sorrow that lay</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">subdued at the bottom of his heart.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">They dined together, and after dinner Catherine thought it best to</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">retire and leave the mother and son alone to enjoy more fully their</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">re-union. When she had left the room—</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“How pretty and lady-like Catherine is growing, madam,” said Major</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Clifton, looking after her, but addressing his mother.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Yes,” replied Mrs. Clifton, “lady-like, but not very pretty; Kate will</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">never be pretty; but if she be ‘blessed to her mind,’ she will be more,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">she will be handsome.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">After spending a long afternoon with his mother, Major Clifton took</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">temporary leave, and went over to White Cliffs, to pay his respects to</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Mrs. Georgia. Most happily for all concerned, Georgia had just left home</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">for a visit of some weeks at Richmond—ignorant, it is to be supposed, of</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Major Clifton’s arrival. He returned and spent the evening with the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">ladies at Hardbargain.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">The next morning found Mrs. Clifton very much better—and in the evening</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">she rode out, accompanied by Major Clifton and Catherine. Mrs. Clifton’s</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">cheerfulness infected all the party—both upon this evening and</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">afterwards. Her decline was so gradual, so painless, that she never took</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">to her bed—but when weakest, sat in the easy-chair in the parlor, often</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">with a little light knitting in her hands, that she would leisurely work</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">upon, or drop into her lap, to be resumed at pleasure, while she</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">conversed with Catherine and Major Clifton, or listened while one of</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">them read, or both sang. There never were more pleasant, serene days,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">than these of the invalid’s gentle decay. It was genial, pensive autumn;</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">the fall of the leaf without the house, and the fall of the leaf within.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Catherine was now the housekeeper. She had—through the increasing</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">weakness of the lady—so gradually slidden into this office, that she</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">scarcely knew at what time its whole burden had accumulated upon her.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">One morning, while Catherine was in the store-room giving out meal and</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">bacon to the negroes, Mrs. Clifton and Major Clifton occupied the parlor</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">alone. He had been reading to her from Jeremy Taylor, but seeing that</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">she had dropped her knitting, and was sitting back with a look of</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">weariness, he thought it time to desist and close the book.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Dear mother, you are fatigued; will you have anything? What shall I</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">bring you?”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Nothing, my son. I am not wearied more than usual, and it will pass in</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">a few minutes.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">The lady was silent for a little while, during which Major Clifton</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">refrained from conversation. And then, after some little thought, she</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">raised her eyes until they met his own and looking at him full in the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">face, she asked—</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“When are you going to marry Catherine, Archer?”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Major Clifton started violently, and looked at the lady in silent</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">astonishment.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Nay, pray answer me—my question is an earnest one.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“My dear madam, you have taken me by surprise!”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Necessary bluntness, Archer.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Very Oliver Cromwellish, madam, my mother.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“You must excuse it, dear Archer. You did not open the subject to me,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">therefore, feeling more anxious upon that affair than any other on</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">earth, I am forced to broach it to you. But you have not answered my</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">question yet.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Dear madam—what—exactly—was it?”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“When are you going to marry Catherine?”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Upon my honor, my dear madam, I have no intention of marrying</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Catherine; nor have I ever given her reason to suppose so.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Ah! I had thought, or rather, I had hoped otherwise,” said the lady,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">relapsing into silence, while Major Clifton subsided into painful</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">thought. Again the dark suspicions insinuated by Mrs. Georgia, arose in</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">his mind, to be repressed again with loathing; and he said indignantly</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">to himself—“It is not true! I can never believe her to be an</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">intriguante. Georgia is mistaken—Georgia’s grateful and affectionate</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">interest in my welfare, leads her to unjust suspicions of others. Kate</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">is noble-hearted—Kate is true—is truth itself. It would be misery to</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">believe otherwise.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Mrs. Clifton gently interrupted his silent self-communion, by saying—</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Well, Archer, since you have no intention whatever of marrying</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Catherine yourself, you can have no reasonable ground of objection to</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">her union with another?”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">He looked up in surprise and anxiety, but soon the startled expression</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">subsided into calmness, and he replied, coolly—</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“_Catherine’s_ union with another! Oh! the supposition involves an</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">impossibility.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“I know you think so, Archer. I know you feel perfectly secure of this</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">sweet girl, and just as easy about her as if she were secured to you by</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">all the chains that church and state can forge, and that is the reason</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">why you take things so coolly, and listen to your pride. But I tell you</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">that it is not as you think. You are not forever secure of Catherine.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Our moods of mind, and our views of things, change with time. And</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">however the maiden may feel or think now, if you hesitate for years</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">between your pride and love, she will naturally arrive at the conclusion</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">that many a generous hearted woman has come to before her, and say to</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">herself, ‘Well, I cannot be happy myself, but my life must not,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">therefore, be wasted—I can make some one else happy,’ and being scorned</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">by one she loves, give herself away to one who loves her.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Major Clifton started to his feet, with all the dark side of his</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">character uppermost, exclaiming—</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Let her attempt it! I would stop such a marriage at the altar!</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Catherine is mine, or nobody’s. She could not repel my claim.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Dear Archer, sit down; do not excite yourself or me. Remember, I am in</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">a dying state,” said the lady, as the best means of calming him.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Dear madam, forgive me—forgive me—but why introduce this very</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">embarrassing and highly exciting subject? I have had conflict enough in</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">my own bosom about it. I love your favorite, I love her jealously,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">fiercely—I admit it—but there are objections and difficulties, which</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">time, or a new set of circumstances, may remove; meanwhile, I could not</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">bear to see her snatched from me. But there is time enough—even if I</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">should decide upon such a step, there is time enough. Kate is very young</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">yet.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“But you are not very young, Archer.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“I know it, dear madam. I have arrived at that age at which men do not</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">make imprudent marriages for love.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“But when they too often make unhappy marriages of convenience. Dear</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Archer, it is a false and sinful principle that keeps you and Catherine</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">apart. Will you spoil two lives by your pride? Your hesitation between</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">inclination and prejudice, weakens you and destroys her.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“‘Prejudices,’ dear madam! Well, I suppose they are prejudices, but just</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">think of the horror of having Carl Kavanagh, the farm laborer, for a</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">brother-in-law, and being called ‘uncle’ by his ragged progeny!”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Oh, Archer, your inhumanity shocks me—they are human creatures, after</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">all—this Carl and his family.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“And don’t you see besides, madam, that if I should marry Catherine, and</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">introduce her into society, the first question would be, ‘Who is she?’</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">and the answer by some good-natured friend, ‘The sister of one of his</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">farm-laborers,’ would expose us to contempt, if it did not rule us out</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">of good company.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Archer! Archer! can it be that you weigh these falsities with the deep</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">realities of life?”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“It is a deplorable thing, indeed, that a girl of such noble nature</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">should come of such ignoble parentage.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“No! it is a congratulatory thing!—or would be so, if it were not such a</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">usual thing! Archer, you will find more moral worth, and it may be more</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">mental worth, among the so-called lower classes, than among the higher;</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">for instance, among the men, look at some of their brows, of Shaksperian</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">height and breadth—think what they would be with cultivation! And I tell</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">you, with all their disadvantages, the lower classes will give to our</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">republic the greatest of her future great men.”[2]</span></p>

<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Major Clifton remained in deep thought for awhile, and then taking the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">hand of the lady, said—</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“My dear mother, the objections that I have advanced are those that have</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">arisen in my mind, from time to time, giving me much pain. I wished to</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">hold them up before myself, as I have just done, in order to see what</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">they really consisted of, and looked like. I have seen the worst of</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">them, and in their ugliest light, and they will not deter me from taking</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">to my heart the girl I love. I have weighed them, and the whole mass is</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">light in the balance with my need of Catherine. I will marry her. I will</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">go and tell her so now. And the ceremony shall be performed whenever you</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">think proper.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Whenever _Kate_ thinks proper, my dear Archer,” replied the lady,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">smiling.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">At this moment a servant entered and delivered a note to Major Clifton.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">It was from Mrs. Georgia, announcing her return to White Cliffs, and</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">begging the company of Major Clifton to tea that evening.</span></p>

<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Major Clifton held the note between his finger and thumb, in a fit of</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">abstraction, while a pleasant, contemplative smile dwelt on his face.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Well, are you not going to answer it?” asked Mrs. Clifton, adding, “The</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">servant waits.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Oh! answer it! yes! what is it about?” he exclaimed, starting out of</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">his reverie, and glancing at the note again. Then he arose, penned a</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">hasty excuse, and delivering it to the messenger, dispatched him.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Returning from this business, he said, “No, I cannot leave home this</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">evening; since I have come to a decision, I wish to have a good,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">confidential talk with my little Kate. How much I have to say to her,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">how much to draw from her, if I can. What a prison delivery of thought</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">and emotion it must be on both sides, if I can get her to talk! But she</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">is so shy, except when under some strong, disinterested feeling for</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">another. Move her sympathies, and she forgets herself and loses all</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">reserve, otherwise—she is so shy.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Yes, very, very shy, _to you_. Kate’s heart and brain are sealed</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">volumes to you. It will require the easy intimacy of long, domestic</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">companionship, to find out all her excellencies. Her husband will love</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">and esteem her far more dearly and highly than ever lover has done—but</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">hush, here she comes.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">The door opened, and Catherine entered, from her morning’s household</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">duties, with her little basket of keys hanging on her arm.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Come hither, dear Kate,” said Major Clifton, holding out his hand.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Catherine put her little basket in its place, and quietly went to his</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">side. He encircled her waist with his arm, and holding both her hands</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">captive in his own, looked fondly in her face till she dropped her eyes</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">in confusion, and then he said, “Dear Kate, my mother here, who loves</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">you almost as much as I do, if that were possible, wants to know when</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">you will make us both happy, by becoming my wife and her daughter.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">He paused for an answer, never removing his eyes from their gaze upon</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">her glowing cheek.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Yes, I am very anxious to know what day you will give yourself to us</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">entirely, dear child!” said Mrs. Clifton, and she also paused for a</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">reply.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Catherine, in extreme confusion, glanced from one to the other, and</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">finally dropped her eyes again.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Come, dearest Kate, it is but a word—the name of some day in the week</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">whispered very low,” said Major Clifton, in her ear.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Yes, let it be soon; let it be within a week, dear child. My time is</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">short, Kate, and I wish to bless your marriage before I go hence. You</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">know I told you that I could calculate the progress of decay, and the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">length of life with some accuracy, and I tell you now that my days are</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">numbered.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Come, Kate, if you cannot speak, give me one of your short, quick nods.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Come, this is Saturday—shall we be married to-morrow?—next</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">day?—Tuesday?—Wednesday?—Thursday?” Catherine, whose heart had been</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">filling all this time, now burst into tears. He drew her head upon his</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">shoulder, where she sobbed awhile, until he stooped and whispered, “Dear</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Catherine, try to calm yourself—do you not see how you excite our</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">mother? there, lift up your head, and go to her; and both of you</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">together arrange all these little matters as mother and daughter should,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">and she will let me know the result,” and tenderly withdrawing his arm,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">he passed her round before him, and stood her beside Mrs. Clifton’s</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">easy-chair, and arose and took his hat and left the room, with the same</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">happy, half-contemplative smile upon his lips. Kate sank down by the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">side of Mrs. Clifton, and dropping her head upon the lady’s lap, wept</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">afresh. The gentle invalid put her hands upon the maiden’s shoulders</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">caressingly, but did not seek to arrest the current of her emotion. It</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">was plain that the girl herself sought to stay her tears, for, between</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">her sobs, she exclaimed—</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Forgive—excuse—I know it’s weak, wrong—it is only because—I’m so</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">grateful!”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">The fit of emotion exhausted itself, and she lifted up her face, wiped</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">her eyes, and said—</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Lady—”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Call me mother, Kate.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Mother! heart’s dearest mother! do you think he mistook me?”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“How, Kate?”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“I couldn’t speak! Indeed, indeed I could not! But I want you to tell</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">him, _mother_, how grateful I am, and how happy! Tell him, _for I never</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">can_, how much and how long I have loved him. My heart has been single</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">to him ever since I first knew him. I will try to make him a good</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">wife—indeed, indeed I will. And where my weakness or my ignorance fails,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">I will pray to Heaven daily for more strength and light. Oh! I know what</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">a sacrifice of pride and prejudice he has made for love of me—tell him</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">so, mother, and tell him—”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“No, dear Kate, I will not tell him that. He has made no sacrifice.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Nonsense. And if he had, you are worth it all, all—his wealth, rank,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">position, pride and all! Be true to yourself.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Oh, what am I, that he should indeed prefer me to all the ladies in the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">great city that he has left; and what can I bring him but my love and my</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">duty—all my love and all my duty!”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“And do you undervalue these, Kate? Why, they are the treasures of</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">treasures. And you would judge them so in another’s case. But here you</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">are fond and blind. Now, dearest Kate, I am so anxious to see you the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">wife of Archer. And I wish to enjoy that pleasure as long as I can—when</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">shall it be?”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Mother, you and he have made me what I am, and given to my life all its</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">worth and value—now what can I do but give back myself and life to you?</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Dearest mother, fix it as you will, I shall be happy, any way.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Thursday, Kate?”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Yes, Thursday, dear mother.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">The lady then embraced and dismissed her, and settled herself back in</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">her chair to take a necessary nap.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Catherine left the parlor in that half-blissful, half-fearful trance</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">that falls upon one when the great life’s desire and hope is about to be</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">realized—happy beyond measure, but somewhat incredulous that this could</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">be really fact—really the “sober certainty of waking bliss,” and no</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">dream, and foreboding some stroke of fate that should snatch the too</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">great joy from her. Major Clifton was standing within the open front</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">door, looking out upon the glorious autumn landscape and the changing</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">foliage of the trees, some of the outer branches of the latter burning</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">so red that they seemed a-fire in the rays of the afternoon sun. But he</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">turned to Catherine, with a buoyant smile and step, and led her out upon</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">the piazza. The habitually grave Archer Clifton was almost gay. He was</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">in that happy state of mind that all will recognize who have ever had a</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">severe, long standing moral conflict brought to end, in which the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">reason, conscience and heart are all satisfied. The struggle between the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">prejudices of rank and the passion of his soul was over, and the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">strongest had conquered, and now reigned alone, and a fine, vigorous,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">healthful joyousness had taken the place of all reserve and gloom and</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">eccentricity; so great and happy was this change, that Catherine felt no</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">more the strange, shy fear of him that had ever placed her at such</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">disadvantage in his presence. He led her to a shaded seat at the end of</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">a piazza, where there were no intruders but a glancing line of sunlight,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">and nothing to disturb them louder than the rustle of a falling leaf.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">And there he poured out the long hoarded mysteries of his heart, talking</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">on and on as the hours passed, until successively the sun went down, and</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">the stars came out, and clouds arose and hid them, and shrouded the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">piazza in darkness. And still he talked—“an’ he would talk his last,”</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">not even heeding the approach of a servant, until Henny’s voice was</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">heard, asking Miss Kate to come and give out tea and sugar for supper.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Then he arose, and half unmindful of the presence of the maid, he said—</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“This is very sweet, dear Kate, very, very sweet—to be able to say to</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">you everything without reserve—to tell you all the long withheld secrets</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">of my soul, and see you listen with such deep interest; but when will</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">you be equally frank with me—when will you show me your heart?”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">The next day Major Clifton rode over to White Cliffs to pay his respects</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">to Georgia.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">The beauty received him with unrestrained joy; but in the conversation</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">that ensued, reverted to what she called “The intrigues of that low born</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">manœuverer, Miss Kavanagh,” asking him if he had not observed a great</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">change in Mrs. Clifton, ascribable entirely to her influence?</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">It gave Major Clifton great pain to hear Catherine traduced in this</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">manner, but he believed Mrs. Georgia to be perfectly sincere in her</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">opinion, and only the victim of a mistake. He told the lady so, adding—</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“I am about to give Miss Kavanagh the highest proof of confidence that</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">one being can give another. I am about to take her for my life’s bosom</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">friend. We shall be married in five days.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Had a bullet sped through her heart, she could not have given a more</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">agonized bound. Then she struck both hands to her temples, started</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">hastily half across the floor, paused again as if distracted, and</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">suddenly cried out—</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“You shall not do it! By my soul, you shall not do it! You never, never</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">shall become the dupe of that woman! I have entered the lists with her.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">I mean, that to save you, I have done so, and before I leave them, I</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">will prove her false and treacherous. God show the right!”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Major Clifton gazed upon her in wonder. The strong emotion that she had</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">exhibited, imposed upon him, for there was no doubting its _reality_;</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">and far from suspecting its _cause_, an unhallowed passion for himself,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">he ascribed it solely to her strong conviction of Catherine’s</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">unworthiness, and to her disinterested regard for his own welfare. And</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">when she came and threw herself upon the sofa beside him, and besought,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">with all the eloquence that passion and the demon could lend her, that</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">he would pause and not hurry on to his ruin, his confidence in</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Catherine’s integrity was shaken to the foundation. And when at the end</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">of an hour he rode home, he reached Hardbargain as miserable as the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">doubt of one beloved can make a man. If love has the Divine power of</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">transfiguring its object until faults are excellencies, suspicion</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">possesses the demoniac faculty of deforming its victim until virtues</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">seem vices, and under its influence the highest and best gifts of the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">maiden, her intellect, virtues, and graces were turned against her; her</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">talent seemed intriguing art; her meekness and humility became meanness</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">and sycophancy; her piety, hypocrisy; and her girlish shyness the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">sinister reserve of conscious guilt.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">It was well that on his return he met Catherine only in his mother’s</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">presence, where deep regard for the lady constrained him into something</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">like forbearance; though even then his moody manner excited some</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">uneasiness in the bosoms of the two ladies. When Catherine left the room</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">to order dinner, the conversation that ensued tended to strengthen his</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">newly revived suspicions. Mrs. Clifton told him, that with his consent</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">she would like to leave the farm of Hardbargain to Catherine, as a</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">testimony of her esteem and affection.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“And for a more practical reason, too,” she said, “for you know, my dear</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Archer, that the estate of White Cliffs being entailed—if you should die</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">before her, and without male children—Catherine and her daughters, if</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">she should have any, would be left homeless. But if I leave her this</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">farm of Hardbargain, it can make no difference to you during your life,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">and if Catherine happen to survive you, it will secure her a home. What</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">do you think of this plan, Archer? You look grave and troubled. If you</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">have the slightest objection, I will not carry it out, of course.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Surely I have not the least right to object, my dear mother; your</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">property you have made by your own labor, and improved by your own</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">admirable management.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“You have the right of nature, my dear Archer; and I see by your</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">gravity, that you dislike this arrangement; therefore it shall not be</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">made.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“You mistake my thoughtfulness, dear madam. If I am somewhat grave, it</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">is upon another subject. Believe me, I have not the slightest fault to</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">find with this plan; _neither does it take me by surprise, I have been</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">prepared for it months since_. Mrs. Georgia Clifton informed me that</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">such was your intention.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Is it possible? How could Georgia have known anything about it? But I</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">suppose she has heard me drop words to that effect. May I hope then,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">that this purpose meets your approbation, Archer?”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Certainly, madam, it can make no material difference, if Kate is to be</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">my wife. And, if she were not to be so, I should be quite as well</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">pleased.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Unconscious of the double meaning of his words, the lady then inquired</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">into the cause of his gloom.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Merely a fit of moodiness, dear mother; the reaction, perhaps, of</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">yesterday’s joy; a mere depression of spirits, which a brisk gallop over</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">the hills will throw off.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“If you are inclined for a ride, Archer, you can do me a service at the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">same time, if you will go to L—— and bring out Mr. White, the lawyer, to</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">draw up my will.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">A spasm of pain passed over the handsome countenance of Major Clifton,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">and he said—</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“I will do anything you please, dearest mother; but surely there is no</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">necessity for haste in this matter.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Archer, _there is_. Besides, my mind will be easier when it is done.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">And Archer, lastly—bring with you a clergyman. I wish to receive the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Holy Communion.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Major Clifton made no farther objection, but left the room to order his</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">horse; and in less than half an hour he found himself on his way to L——.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Mrs. Clifton summoned Kate. When the girl entered, she found the lady on</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">the verge of fainting from over-exertion and extreme weakness. Catherine</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">grew pale with sudden fear, and her hands trembled as she poured out and</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">administered a restorative. Somewhat revived by the cordial, Mrs.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Clifton said—</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Kate, write two notes, one to Mrs. Georgia Clifton, and one to your</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">brother Carl, asking each of them to come here this evening to witness a</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">deed—or rather _two of them_, my dear Kate—the signing of my last will</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">and testament, and the solemnization of your marriage—for both must be</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">hastened, Kate. My dear child, take your pen and write at once.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Deeply troubled, extremely agitated, yet struggling to govern her</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">feelings, Catherine found the writing materials and penned the two</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">notes; but when she had finished them, in the abstraction of her great</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">grief, she misdirected them—and sent the note intended for Mrs. Georgia</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">to Carl Kavanagh, and that intended for Carl to Mrs. Georgia. When she</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">had dispatched these notes by different messengers, and returned to the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">parlor, Mrs. Clifton said—</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Call Henny, my dear Kate, and let her assist you in getting me up</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">stairs. It has come at last, Kate.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Almost dismayed by sorrow, Catherine rung the bell that brought the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">servants into the room. And between them they raised the lady to her</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">feet. Mrs. Clifton took a long look around the room, as though she were</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">taking a last leave of every dear familiar object in it; and then</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">suffered herself to be supported up to her chamber.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2"><span class="Apple-converted-space">                  </span>* <span class="Apple-converted-space">      </span>* <span class="Apple-converted-space">      </span>* <span class="Apple-converted-space">      </span>* <span class="Apple-converted-space">      </span>*</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Mrs. Georgia Clifton was pacing her chamber floor, in all the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">distraction of excited evil passions, racking her brain for an expedient</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">to ruin her rival and break off the impending marriage, when the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“spirits that tend on mortal thoughts,” furnished her with one. A</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">messenger entered and handed her a sealed envelope, directed in the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">hand-writing of Catherine Kavanagh. She opened it in surprise,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">curiosity, and even in some degree of vague, guilty fear, and found</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">within the misdirected note of Kate to Carl. It read simply as follows:</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“DEAR CARL:—</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Mrs. Clifton is almost dying. She says you must come to the house</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>this afternoon, at four o’clock, to meet a lawyer and a clergyman, and</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>with Mrs. Georgia Clifton, to witness the signing of her last will,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>and also my marriage. Do not keep her waiting.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2"><span class="Apple-converted-space">                                                            </span>“CATHERINE.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">This note contained no expression of esteem or affection for the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">invalid, or regret at her approaching death. No! for Catherine’s</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">veneration and sorrow were too earnest, too real, to be a matter of</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">wordy formula. But in the evil heart of Georgia this simplicity was</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">turned against the girl. And her first idea, revealed in her smile of</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">satisfaction, was to show this mis-sent note to Archer Clifton, and bid</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">him look and see with what perfect coolness and indifference the writer</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">could announce the approaching demise of her benefactress. But while</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">this thought was revolving in her mind, Satan suggested a surer plan—a</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">deadly stratagem. And at this inspiration of the fiend, the dark face of</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">the baleful woman lighted up with demoniac joy. She seized the note</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">again, and rushed to the window, and scanned the hand-writing. Georgia</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">inherited all the imitative talent of her father, the portrait painter.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Catherine’s hand-writing was unique: small, square letters, with heavy</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">strokes, a chirography peculiar to herself, yet easily imitated. Mrs.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Georgia copied a few selected words—compared them with the originals,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">and was satisfied with her work. Next she wished to procure note paper,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">exactly like it. Catherine’s note was written upon neutral-tinted paper,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">that had been given her by Major Clifton. Mrs. Georgia recognized it as</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">some that had belonged to him. She thought there might possibly be a few</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">stray sheets in the writing-table of the library. She went thither, and</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">after a diligent search, found a single sheet. This she took with her,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">and returned to her chamber, locked herself in, and sat down to her</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">fiendish task. Perfectly imitating the hand-writing of Catherine, she</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">forged the following letter:</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“DEAREST CARL:—</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“My long slavery is almost over. The old woman is at her last gasp,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>and wants you to come over this afternoon at four o’clock, to witness</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>her will and my marriage. You see I have succeeded in catching the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>aristocrat, and in wheedling his mother into giving me Hardbargain, in</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>my sole right. Am I not a triumphant diplomatist? When she is dead,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>and I am married, and mistress of White Cliffs and of Hardbargain, as</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I shall probably reside at the principal seat, I intend to let you</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>this farm, on the easiest terms. Never fear Major Clifton’s</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>interference. You know _I_ know how to manage him.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2"><span class="Apple-converted-space">                                                            </span>“CATHERINE.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">When she had completed her demon-work, Georgia carefully examined it. It</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">satisfied her. She smiled, and muttered—“_Any one_ who ever saw</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Catherine’s queer hand-writing, would feel safe in swearing this to be</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">hers.” Then she folded it in the form of the other note, and placed it</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">in the original envelope—and threw it, broken-sealed as it was, upon the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">table, exclaiming—“There!—</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2"><span class="Apple-converted-space">                </span>“‘I have set my life upon a cast,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2"><span class="Apple-converted-space">                </span>And will abide the hazard of the die.’”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2"><span class="Apple-converted-space">                  </span>* <span class="Apple-converted-space">      </span>* <span class="Apple-converted-space">      </span>* <span class="Apple-converted-space">      </span>* <span class="Apple-converted-space">      </span>*</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">In the meanwhile, Catherine watched by the bedside of Mrs. Clifton,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">awaiting the return of Major Clifton, with the clergyman and the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">attorney.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">About three o’clock in the afternoon the party arrived. The professional</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">gentlemen remained in the parlor, while Major Clifton went up into the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">chamber of his mother. As he approached her bed, and perceived the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">fearful change a few hours had wrought in her appearance, and recognized</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">the sure approach of death, he was so shocked, so overwhelmed with</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">sorrow, that it was with the utmost difficulty he could sustain his</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">self-command.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">She held out to him her wasted hand, saying, quietly—</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“My dear Archer, I wish to have the marriage ceremony between you and</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Kate performed this afternoon, if you please.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Certainly, my dear mother, it shall be as you desire,” he replied,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">repressing a great groan—but desirous, above all things, to gratify that</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">dying parent. “Shall it be _now_, mother?”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“No, dear Archer, not just yet—I want the holiest things left for the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">_last_—I want the will drawn up, witnessed, signed and sealed _first_;</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">then the marriage ceremony performed; and last, I wish to receive the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Holy Communion—after which, I shall be ready to depart.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Mother—the minister and the lawyer are below stairs, awaiting your</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">leisure—they will remain over to-night. Do not disturb yourself.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“My good Archer, I made Catherine write to Carl Kavanagh and to Mrs.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Georgia to come to see me this afternoon, they have not yet arrived.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Please go and send again for them.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Archer Clifton bent and kissed his mother’s forehead, and went down</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">stairs. In the hall he saw Carl Kavanagh, hat in hand, waiting.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Carl immediately advanced, and said—</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Ah! Major Clifton, I am waiting here to see my sister to return to her</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">this note, that she has sent me by mistake I think—perhaps you can</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">explain it.” And he handed to Archer Clifton the mis-sent note of</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Catherine to Georgia.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Major Clifton understood the mistake at once, and retaining the note,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">replied—</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Catherine wrote two notes, summoning yourself and Mrs. Georgia Clifton</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">to Hardbargain, this afternoon, to witness the signature of a certain</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">document. She placed them in envelopes, and in her haste misdirected</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">them—that is all. Pray remain here, while I ride over home, and bring</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Mrs. Georgia.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Carl Kavanagh sat down in the hall, and Major Clifton mounted a fresh</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">horse, and galloped over to White Cliffs. Dismounting at the gate, he</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">threw the reins to a servant and entering the house, sent a message to</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Mrs. Georgia.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">The servant returned, and requesting Major Clifton to follow, led the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">way up to Mrs. Georgia’s own room, opened the door, announced the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">visitor, and retired.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Archer entered the room, and found the lady seated at her work-table,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">but looking pale and anxious. By her work-box lay the envelope of Kate’s</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">true note with the forged note in it.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Ah!” said Major Clifton, after greeting her, “I see that you have</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">received Kate’s note.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Yes—one that was never intended for _my_ eyes, but of those of a fellow</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">conspirator.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Conspirator, madam!”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Yes, sir. Do you surmise all the consequences of these mis-sent</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">letters? Look at this!” she said, throwing it to him, “written by Miss</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Kavanagh, but directed by mistake to me. Yes, look at it! Examine the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">envelope! and then read the contents of the note!”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Major Clifton glanced at the superscription, opened the note, and read</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">it through with a cheek growing pale and paler—until he finished it—then</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">tossed it from him, and burying his face in his hands groaned aloud. He</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">had not the slightest suspicion that the infamous letter was a</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">forgery—no!—he had not a single merciful doubt that it was the work of</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Catherine—nay, he would have sworn to the hand-writing, if called upon</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">to do so in a court of justice—he would have sworn to it though Kate’s</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">life hung upon his oath! Any one else who had ever seen her peculiar</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">chirography would have felt constrained to do so, if requested—save</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">two—she who lay dying at Hardbargain—and she was to know nothing about</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">it—and he, the rejected lover, now far away, who would have cast that</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">note aside in high disdain, and staked his honor on her truth. Clifton</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">groaned aloud, in the bitterness of disappointed esteem. Resentment</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">itself was swallowed up in sorrow, and he exclaimed—</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Oh! would to God she had died, or _I_ had, before I knew this!”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Rejoice, rather, that you are saved!”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“_Saved_, madam!”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Yes—_saved_. You will never marry her, now. You are perfectly</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">justifiable in breaking with the unmasked traitress!”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“And in shaking the last few sands in my mother’s glass of life. The</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">discovery of that girl’s treachery has driven me to despair—it would</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">kill my mother! No, lady! I must marry her, that my beloved mother may</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">depart in peace.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Marry her!” screamed Georgia, with the cry of a wounded hyena—“marry</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">her, and sacrifice all your hopes of happiness, for the sake of keeping</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">quiet the last few hours of a dying woman! You will not do such a</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">thing.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“My hopes of happiness, did you say, Mrs. Clifton? Ah, lady, can you not</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">comprehend, then, that when one at my age has discovered—beyond all</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">possibility of doubt—the total unworthiness of one the most beloved on</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">earth—the heart’s most cherished darling—the life’s dearest hope—” down</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">broke his voice, and down dropped his head upon his hands—then rising,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">impatiently, he exclaimed—“I say, can you not comprehend that I have</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">_no_ hopes of happiness left? I loved her so! I trusted her so! I</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">sacrificed such strong prejudices for her! And I was as happy as a</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">converted sinner, when the struggle was over and the sacrifice made. I</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">could have shaken hands with her freckled-handed brother, and claimed</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">kindred with all his rugged race! And now!—I am unmanned! I am a fool!”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“No, you are not, unless you marry her. You are not the first</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">noble-minded man that has been duped by a bad woman! You feel it as</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">every generous hearted man would. But it will pass. Life has many</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">chances, and you will be happy yet. _My_ friendship is not much,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">perhaps, but is it not something?”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Yes—yes—yes—yes—sweet friend, it is much,” said Archer Clifton,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">slowly—half soliloquizing, as he took and held her hand. Then suddenly</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">starting, as out of a reverie, he exclaimed—“Mrs. Clifton, you know my</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">errand here—it is to bring you over to Hardbargain, for the purpose of</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">which you have already been advised by the note.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“To be present at your mad marriage, among other things?”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Yes.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“I will not go! I cannot! I cannot witness such a sacrifice.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“As you please, dear Georgia. I suppose there is no imperative necessity</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">of your doing so—good-bye!” and he arose, and lifted his hat from the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">table.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Yes! good-bye, indeed!” replied Georgia, bitterly—“good-bye, indeed! if</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">you persist in your insane purpose!—I shall remain here, and hope to the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">last. But when I hear that this marriage has really taken place, I leave</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">White Cliffs within the hour!”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“You will think differently, dear lady, and I shall see you again,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">shortly.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Never!—as the husband of that traitress.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">He did not reply. He raised her hand to his lips, and left her.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Left to herself, mad impulses seized the disappointed woman. At one</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">instant she was impelled to seize the forged letter, and rush to the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">death-bed of Mrs. Clifton, and there denounce her favorite as a</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">hypocrite and a traitress. But a moment’s reflection convinced her that</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">no art of hers could induce the dying woman to think evil of the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">excellent girl she herself had educated. That on the contrary, such a</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">step might possibly result in her own signal defeat and exposure, and</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">the everlasting anger and contempt of Archer Clifton. Her brain was</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">beginning to reel, and her self-confidence to wane. In sudden fear she</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">looked around for the forged letter, intending to burn it. It was</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">nowhere to be seen. Then she recollected that Major Clifton had, on</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">departing, picked it up, and put it in his pocket. And sick with</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">disappointed love, jealousy, hatred, and fear, she tottered towards a</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">lounge, but ere she reached it, fell upon the floor. In the meanwhile,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Major Clifton, riding at full speed, reached the farm-house.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">On reaching Hardbargain, Major Clifton went immediately to Mrs.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Clifton’s chamber. He found her still sinking. She inquired, in a faint</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">voice, whether he had brought Mrs. Georgia. He replied, with perhaps a</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">pardonable ambiguity of speech, that Mrs. Georgia was too much</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">_indisposed_ to attend. Then she said that she supposed Mr. White (the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">clergyman) would consent to act in her stead. She informed him that the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">attorney had been with her, and had drawn up her will according to her</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">instruction, and she requested that the parties might be assembled in</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">her room to witness the signing. Major Clifton left the chamber to</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">summon them, and soon returned, accompanied by the lawyer, the minister,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Carl Kavanagh and Catherine. The will was then read, after which the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">lady was raised up in bed, and supported in the arms of her son; the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">document was placed upon a portfolio and laid before her, and a pen</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">dipped in ink and presented to her. She signed her name, and immediately</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">sank back exhausted. The two witnesses affixed their signatures, and the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">will was delivered into the custody of the attorney. A restorative was</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">administered to the invalid, and she was arranged comfortably upon her</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">pillows. Then she took the hand of her son, and whispered—</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Let the marriage ceremony be performed at once, dearest Archer.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">He pressed that wan hand, laid it tenderly down upon the coverlet, and</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">spoke apart with the clergyman, who occupied the chair beside the head</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">of the bed. The minister solemnly arose, drew a prayer-book from his</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">pocket and opened it. Major Clifton went quietly and spoke a few words</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">in explanation to the lawyer and Carl Kavanagh, who then approached the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">bedside. Lastly, he took the hand of Catherine, and led her up before</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">the minister. The marriage ceremony commenced. It was performed</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">according to the ritual of the Protestant Episcopal Church. But when the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">great question was put to the bridegroom—“Archer, ‘wilt thou have this</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">woman to be thy wedded wife, to live together, after God’s ordinance, in</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">the holy estate of matrimony? Wilt thou love her, comfort her, honor</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">her,’” etc.—instead of answering, according to the ritual, “I will,” he</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">replied by a grave and formal bow, with silent lips, “that scarce their</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">scorn forbore.” When the corresponding question was put to the bride,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Kate too replied by a gentle inclination of the head, but her true heart</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">responded sincerely, earnestly. When the last benediction was given, and</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">when, according to the old formula, the bridegroom was to salute his</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">bride, he merely touched her cheek with cold lips, and passed her on to</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">his mother, who held out her arms to embrace her daughter. The</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">singularity of Major Clifton’s manner was scarcely noticed, or it was</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">ascribed to the solemnity of the attending circumstances. Mrs. Clifton</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">now desired that all, with the exception of her son and daughter and the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">clergyman, should bid her adieu and leave the room. Her request was</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">complied with, and when they had retired, she signified her wish to</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">partake of the Sacrament of the Lord’s Supper with her children. Major</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Clifton was constrained to decline, upon conscientious scruples; for how</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">could he partake of the Sacrament of peace and brotherly love, with his</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">heart consumed with indignation against his newly-married bride?</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Catherine, however, participated in the Holy Communion, while he looked</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">on with surprise, mixed with a degree of horror. When the sacred rite</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">was over, the minister of God took an affectionate leave, and departed.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">When the minister was gone, and they were left alone together, the dying</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">mother beckoned her son and daughter to come and sit near her. They</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">obeyed her, and she addressed them a few words of earnest, affectionate</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">counsel, blessed them, and resigned herself to rest. Her eyelids closed</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">calmly, and her breathing was gentle and regular; they had to mark</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">attentively before they knew that it grew fainter and fainter. Once she</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">opened her eyes, and, smiling her old, reflecting smile, said—</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Dear Archer, I have often tried to detect the exact moment of falling</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">asleep. I watch now, to see if I can seize the precise instant of</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">passing from mortal to immortal life.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">And she closed her eyes again. After a few minutes, she said—</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Sing to me, dear Kate! You know—Heber’s death hymn.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Catherine bent and kissed the pallid lips of the dying woman, and then</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">her voice arose, sweet, clear and spiritual as angels’ songs, in that</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">immortal requiem—</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2"><span class="Apple-converted-space">                 </span>“Vital spark of heavenly flame,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2"><span class="Apple-converted-space">                 </span>Quit, oh! quit this mortal frame;</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2"><span class="Apple-converted-space">                 </span>Trembling, hoping, lingering, flying,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2"><span class="Apple-converted-space">                 </span>Oh! the pain, the bliss of dying—</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2"><span class="Apple-converted-space">                 </span>Hark! they whisper, angels say—</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2"><span class="Apple-converted-space">                 </span>Sister spirit, come away—</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">At the end of the first stanza, she murmured, faintly—</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Your voice, too, dear Archer.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">His voice arose now in unison with Catherine’s, and they sang the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">remainder—</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2"><span class="Apple-converted-space">                 </span>“The world recedes—it disappears:</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2"><span class="Apple-converted-space">                 </span>Heaven opens on my eyes; my ears</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2"><span class="Apple-converted-space">                   </span>With sounds seraphic ring.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2"><span class="Apple-converted-space">                 </span>Lend, lend your wings; I mount, I fly!</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2"><span class="Apple-converted-space">                 </span>Oh, grave, where is thy victory?</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2"><span class="Apple-converted-space">                   </span>Oh, death, where is thy sting?”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">They ceased, and looked upon the marble face before them. It was still</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">in death, but there remained upon the countenance the impress of the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">ecstatic smile with which the spirit had taken its flight—</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2"><span class="Apple-converted-space">                            </span>“Her death</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2"><span class="Apple-converted-space">                </span>Was like the setting of a planet mild.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2"><span class="Apple-converted-space">                             </span>CHAPTER XXXI.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2"><span class="Apple-converted-space">                           </span>THE POISON WORKS.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2"><span class="Apple-converted-space">                                       </span>’Tis slander;</span></p>

<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">When Archer Clifton saw that all indeed was over; when he looked upon</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">that mother-face, the first which had ever met his conscious gaze in</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">life; that old, familiar face, which seemed to him coeval with his</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">being, and a necessary part of it; that face the most intimate, the most</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">loving, the most faithful which had ever shone upon his path of</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">life;—and felt that it was lost forever; that the light of those quiet</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">eyes was darkened forever; the sound of that kind voice silenced</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">forever; the smile of those calm lips fled forever;—when he clasped that</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">mother-hand, and felt that those dear fingers would close upon his own</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">in cordial grasp never, never more;—oh! when he felt that all was over,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">over, “finished, done and ended,” he fell upon his knees by the corpse,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">dropped his head upon the cold, inanimate bosom, and broke into</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">convulsive sobs.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Weeping freely, Catherine knelt by his side, and put her arm around his</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">neck. He was unconscious of her presence, until, after giving way to</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">sorrow for a few moments, she lifted up her head, and wiped her eyes,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">and controlling her own emotion, sought to console him—</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Do not grieve so, dear Archer,” she murmured, with her arm again around</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">him, “do not grieve, but _pray_.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Then indeed he suddenly grew calm, unclasped the gentle arm of Catherine</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">from his neck, arose slowly from his kneeling posture, took her hand,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">and raised her upon her feet, and regarding her with a stern and</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">sorrowful countenance, said, in severe rebuke—</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Come! madam! no more hypocrisy now! None here at least! It is useless</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">hereafter! You have accomplished your design. You _are_ a ‘successful</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">diplomatist,’ and your ’long slavery’ _is_ now over.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Catherine lifted her eyes, dilated with sorrow and amazement, and fixed</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">them on his face an instant; but the look she met there, the expression</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">of mingled suffering and severity, such as might have sat upon the brow</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">of Brutus, when the feelings of the man and the duty of the judge strove</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">in his bosom, awed her into silence before him. She could express no</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">surprise or grief—ask no explanation. The old shyness and fear came over</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">her, and her eyes fell, and her cheeks paled. Again he spoke in the same</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">stern, sorrowful tone—</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Ay, cower with conscious guilt! You are discovered! And you should have</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">been unmasked before _her_ to-day, but that I did not wish to embitter</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">her last moments! that only saved you! Come! leave the room that you</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">desecrate with your presence! Leave me alone with my dead!”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">But instead of obeying, she stood like a statue before him.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Then he took her hand and led her through the door, and closed it behind</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">her.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Catherine stood there where he had placed her, amazed, confounded,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">unable to move a step forward, until the thought of practical duties,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">now pressing upon her, gave her strength, and she passed on to summon</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">those whose office it was to prepare the dead for burial. But amid all</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">the multifarious tasks that devolved upon her at that trying time, as</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">newly installed and unassisted mistress of the house, she could not for</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">an instant forget her awful bereavement, or the dreadful anger of her</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">husband.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">He came out of the room of death at last, and passed Catherine on the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">stairs, and his stern, averted countenance at that moment almost broke</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">her heart. But she went on enduringly with her tasks. Often she raised</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">her soul in prayer to God for help. Once, during that desolate night,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">she found time to open her Bible, and her eyes fell upon this text:</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Romans, 8, 28. “And we know that all things work together for good, to</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">them that love God”—she paused upon the text, repeating, “‘all things,’</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">_all things_, even this! I will believe it!” And her face grew beautiful</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">with divine faith, and she reverently closed the book, and went on her</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">way comforted. She had need of fresh strength and comfort, indeed, to</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">meet a fresh trial. On coming down stairs she met Henny, who seemed to</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">be on the look out for her. and who placed a note in her hand. It was</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">from Major Clifton, and read as follows—</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“I desire that you keep your chamber to-morrow, or, at least, refrain</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>from insulting the memory of the dead, by appearing at the funeral.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2"><span class="Apple-converted-space">                                                        </span>ARCHER CLIFTON.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">She nodded her head slowly, meditatively, with a look of sweetest</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">resignation; then beckoned Henny to follow her, and returned to her</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">chamber. There she sat down and wrote the following note—</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“I will absent myself from the funeral, since you wish me to do so; I</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>will also keep my room, if you desire it, when I remind you that there</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>is no one to supply my place in the household arrangements for the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>solemnities of the day.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2"><span class="Apple-converted-space">                                                            </span>“CATHERINE.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">She sent this by Henny, but received no reply to it. Construing silence</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">into consent, she went about the house as usual attending to her duties.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">In the meantime, Major Clifton sat in his study, awaiting an answer to a</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">note he had written to Mrs. Georgia, apprising her of the recent events,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">and requesting her to come at once to the house. He had not to wait</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">long; his messenger returned, and informed him that he had met the lady</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">on her way to L——, to take the stage coach to Richmond. The man, at the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">same time, gave the intelligence that Mr. Kavanagh waited in the hall,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">to know if he could be of any service to Major Clifton on the present</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">occasion.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Show him in,” said Major Clifton.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">The man went out and soon returned, accompanied by Carl, whose face</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">expressed the most profound and sincere sympathy.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Set a chair for Mr. Kavanagh, and retire, James.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">The man obeyed, Carl seated himself, and in person repeated his</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">condolences, and his tenders of service.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">In reply, Major Clifton took from his pocket the forged note and laid it</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">before him, saying, coldly—</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“There is the note your sister wrote to you, and sent by mistake to Mrs.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Georgia Clifton. Read it.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Carl took it up, wondering what might be the use of reading it _now_,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">but as he glanced over its contents, his eyes grew wide with</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">astonishment, and when he had finished it, he laid it down again,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">exclaiming—</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“I am confounded!”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“I should think so, sir!” coldly remarked Major Clifton.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“She speaks of letting _me_ the farm! I never had the slightest desire</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">to rent the farm, and before I heard the will read, I had not even the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">slightest idea that Mrs. Clifton designed to leave it to my sister!”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Ah! Really?” asked Mr. Clifton, ironically.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Really and truly, and sincerely and positively, I had not.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Tautological asseveration is no evidence. Why should she have written</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">to you thus if you had not?”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“How do I know, sir? I tell you I am amazed! And if I did not know,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">beyond all possibility of doubt, the hand-writing to be Catherine’s, I</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">should say that she did not write, and that she never could have written</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">such a letter.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Which means plainly this, that if there did not exist the most positive</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">proof to the contrary, you would fain deny it,” sneered Major Clifton.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Yes, sir!” answered Carl, boldly. “If the proof positive to _my mind_,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">as well as to your own did not exist, I _would_ deny it, and I _do_ deny</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">any personal agency or knowledge about it whatever! I say to you that I</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">am amazed! It is incomprehensible to me how Catherine could have</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">conceived, much less written such a letter! And above all things, it is</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">inexplicable how she should have written so disrespectfully of Mrs.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Clifton, whom she loved and venerated so much.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Or whom, for certain purposes, she _pretended_ to love and venerate so</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">much.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“She _did_, sir! She really _did_. She was sincere in her esteem and</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">affection. She was sincere in all things.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“I know she affected rare sincerity.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“It was no affectation, Major Clifton. I have known her from</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">childhood—it was truth. And I tell you, I scarcely believe my own eyes!</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">I scarcely believe that I am awake when I see that letter! I am</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">confounded!”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Well, sir!” said Major Clifton, sternly, his whole manner changing,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“_I_, at least am not so confounded as not to know that she never would</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">have written such a letter to you, had you not been the confidant of her</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">plans. And _you_ are not so confounded as to be ignorant, that, after</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">such a development, I am constrained to forbid you the house, and to</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">interdict all communication between your sister and yourself.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">There was something of Catherine’s own nobility in the manner of Carl’s</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">reply. He stood a moment with his forehead thrown back, as if in calm,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">unimpassioned thought, then he said—</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Major Clifton, my sister is now your wife, and you have, doubtless, the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">perfect right to control her actions—neither do I accuse you of undue</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">severity in this affair, for, under like circumstances, I should,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">perhaps, be tempted to act in the same way. I cannot account for this</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">letter. For the present, it must remain unexplained. Nor can I exculpate</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">myself any more than my sister from the odium of a suspicion, which God</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">knows I am willing to bear with her, since I cannot clear her of it. You</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">do not know how dear to an only brother’s heart is his only sister. Yes!</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">I _am_ willing to share the odium with her, hoping, _knowing_ that it</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">will pass away in time. And then, Major Clifton, you will feel more pain</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">at the recollection of the injustice you have done us, than I feel now</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">in suffering it. You will be more angry with yourself than I could be</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">with you. You will reproach yourself more bitterly than I could reproach</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">you, were I never so indignant. And I am not indignant at all. I could</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">not be so! All feelings are subdued to calmness in the sacred proximity</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">of the unburied dead in the next room. One thing only remains to be</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">said. It is this: I cannot continue to live upon this place, under the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">cloud of the master’s ill opinion. My engagement as manager of this farm</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">terminates with this year, I shall be glad, if before the time expires,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">you will provide yourself with another overseer.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“As you please, Mr. Kavanagh. Yet I should not have sent you away with</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">your young family.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“You are considerate, sir!” said Carl, bowing, then adding—“I presume</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">you have no further commands for me, Major Clifton?”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“None, Mr. Kavanagh.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Good-night, sir.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Good-night.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">The next day was the day of the funeral. Before the people began to</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">assemble, Catherine, impelled by an irresistible desire to gaze once</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">more upon the face of her beloved friend, found herself at the door of</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">the front parlor in which the corpse was laid out for burial. But here,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">with her hand upon the lock, she hesitated, and finally stifling her</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">crying want turned away, saying within herself—“No, I will not intrude.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">I will be guided by the spirit as well as by the letter of his commands.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">He will not accept my love. To yield him perfect unquestioning obedience</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">is all the earthly comfort I have left.” And she began to retrace her</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">steps.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Major Clifton came out of the back room and met her face to face.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“What were you doing near that door, Catherine?”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“I wished to take a last look at her dear—” Here Kate burst into tears</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">and wept convulsively a few minutes—during which, Clifton watched her in</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">stern sorrow. Then controlling herself, she said, “I wished to look once</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">more, and for the last time, upon her beloved face. But when I reached</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">the door, and was about to enter, I remembered your commands and turned</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">back.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Clifton, who had never taken his eyes from her, groaned aloud. Then he</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">said, gravely and sadly—</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Catherine, if any feeling of penitential sorrow inspires your wish to</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">go there, go, in Heaven’s name! And may the sight of that dead face</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">bring you to repentance.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">She turned to thank him, and ask him what he wished her to repent—but</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">before she could find words, he had re-entered his study. Catherine</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">passed into the room of death, turned down the pall, and gazed upon the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">face of the dead. It had changed very much—every furrow and every</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">wrinkle was softened out of it, the forehead was as smooth as the brow</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">of childhood, an ineffable, a divine repose spread like a dream of</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Heaven over the features. Catherine’s tears were stayed, the convulsions</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">of her bosom were calmed, her soul was awed and exalted as she gazed</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">upon this countenance, so beautiful in death. But at last her full heart</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">revealed itself in a look of unutterable tenderness and devotion, and</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">she murmured, in low, slow, gentle tones—“You always loved and trusted</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">me, and for your dear sake, I will be a good wife to your son. Yes!</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">whatever he may be to me, for your dear sake, as well as for his own, I</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">will be a good wife to him. Hear my vow.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“I cannot think you dead. This is all I see—this beautiful, calm clay;</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">but I know your spirit hovers near. Hear my vow. Hear me promise, with</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">God’s grace, to dedicate all my faculties of brain, and heart, and hands</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">to his interest and happiness! to bear all things, to endure all things,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">to hope all things, even to the end of life, come what may;” she stooped</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">and sealed her vow by a farewell kiss upon the brow and lips of that</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">beloved face, and reverently covered it, and—not to abuse her privilege</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">by too long a stay—slowly left the room. She never saw that face again.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Within an hour afterwards, the company began to assemble in great</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">crowds, for Mrs. Clifton was widely known and greatly respected and</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">beloved. The clergyman, who was to perform the burial service, arrived,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">and the solemnity commenced. In the mean time Catherine sat in her</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">distant chamber, listening to the faint, inaudible sound of the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">minister’s voice that reached her from afar, or else engaged in prayer,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">but always calmed, strengthened and consoled. Many people at the funeral</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">wondered greatly why the young bride had not appeared with her husband;</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">but some one imagined it to be because she was too much overcome by</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">sorrow to be present, and told it as a fact, which was at once believed,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">and circulated. And that—like many an other idle falsehood,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">satisfactorily silenced conjecture. When the services were over, and the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">funeral procession had left the house for the grave-yard—when Catherine</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">felt that her more than mother was now indeed gone, gone, gone—she cast</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">herself upon her bed in the last agony of sorrow.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Little household cares. What blessed though humble ministers to sorrow</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">they are—gently drawing away the mourner from the contemplation of her</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">grief, and compelling attention to themselves. So they give occupation,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">and induce forgetfulness—aiding in their humble way the great</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">comforters, religion and time. An hour spent in bitter tears and sobs,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">and then the little domestic duties came hovering about her like little</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">children, claiming her care. There was a large supper to be prepared,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">and bed-chambers to be got ready for friends who had come from the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">remoter parts of the county, and who would therefore remain until the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">next morning. And so Catherine arose and refreshed herself with cold</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">water and a change of dress, and went below stairs to superintend the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">operations of her cook and house-maids.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">When everything was in readiness, she went into the drawing-room, where</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">she received the returning visitors with a pensive, gentle dignity that</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">won all their hearts, proud conservators of rank as they were. And that</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">evening, young girl and new bride as she was, she presided at the head</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">of the long table, filled with the county aristocrats, with all the ease</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">and grace of a lady “to the manner born.” Preoccupied by one earnest</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">thought and purpose, she never once remembered herself as a new comer</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">into their ranks, or troubled herself with the question of what might be</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">their opinion of her. For the rest, her courtesy was graceful and</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">dignified, because it was natural, and not assumed—the effect of</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">benevolence and kindly social feeling, and not of pride, vanity, or</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">ostentation.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">The next morning, after breakfast, the guests departed. And many and</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">cordial were the invitations to their houses extended to Catherine by</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">all—even the haughtiest defenders of the sacredness of caste. Catherine</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">received all these civilities with a gracious nobleness, that sat</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">naturally and well upon her. And all this—the very evident esteem and</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">respect of her neighbors, and the admirable manner in which Catherine</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">received them, would have highly gratified the pride of Major Clifton,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">could anything except her exculpation from suspicion have pleased him.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">As it was, he witnessed it all with a moody brow, and sneering lip, and</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">murmured to himself—</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Better and better, ‘Maria Teresa.’ You should have seen more of the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">world, before you threw your diplomatic talents away upon me, and my</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">country neighbors.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Well, at length they were all, to the very last guest, gone, and Major</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Clifton and Catherine were left alone, left standing together in the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">hall, whence they had seen the departures.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Catherine, hesitating between her fear of intruding upon his notice, and</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">her dislike to leave him abruptly and rudely, stood—no longer</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">self-possessed and noble—but with her eyes fixed upon the ground, and</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">with the color deepening in her cheek, in embarrassed silence, wishing</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">that he might say something to her, something to explain the nature of</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">that dark cloud that had arisen so strangely between them.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">He broke the silence by saying, coldly—</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Mrs. Clifton—” She started and colored, at hearing herself addressed by</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">her new name. “It is my intention to make White Cliffs our future home.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">I desire that you be ready to accompany me thither to-morrow morning.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Catherine bowed her head in acquiescence. And with a cold nod, he placed</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">his hat upon his head, and walked forth.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Catherine went in, and occupied the remainder of the day in directing</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">the labor of her servants, who were all employed in setting the house in</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">order after the late, confusing events, in packing away goods, and</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">covering up furniture, and in preparing generally for the closing up of</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">the building.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>

<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">The next morning after breakfast, the family carriage was announced to</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">take them to White Cliffs. Catherine put on her bonnet and shawl, and</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">stood waiting, until Major Clifton, drawing on his gloves, came forward</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">and attended her to the carriage door. He handed her in, entered</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">himself, took the seat opposite to her, and bade the coachman drive on.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">The whole distance between Hardbargain and White Cliffs was passed over</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">in perfect silence by the parties. Major Clifton preserving a stern</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">gravity of demeanor, and Catherine scarcely daring to lift her eyes,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">lest she should encounter that severe but sorrowful gaze that almost</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">broke her heart. She longed to inquire—</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Oh, Major Clifton! What is this that has arisen between us? Give the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">misery a name! Tell me?” But the shyness and fear she had always felt in</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">his presence, and doubly felt when he was reserved or displeased, and</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">above all, the bashfulness of new bridehood, forced her into silence.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">At last the ride was over, and the carriage stopped before the main</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">entrance of the mansion-house.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">The plantation laborers, in their holyday clothes, marshalled by the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">overseer, were assembled upon the lawn, and the house servants in their</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Sunday’s best,” with the housekeeper at their head, waited on the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">piazza “to pay their duty.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">When the carriage had drawn up, Major Clifton alighted and assisted his</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">bride to get out. He led her up the marble stairs to the front door. The</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">housekeeper with a curtsey, stepped forward to attend her. But with the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">courteous kindness that Major Clifton seldom omitted, he waved her</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">aside, merely saying—</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Mrs. Mercer, send all these women about their duties, and tell Turnbull</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">to disperse the men. I do not wish to be disturbed. There is my</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">pocket-book—give them what they want—only let me be quiet.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“And give them my love and good wishes,” murmured Catherine, shyly, but</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">not wishing to dismiss them so coldly, for her desolate heart had been</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">comforted by the looks of sincere respect and affection with which they</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">had seemed to receive and accept her as their new mistress.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Major Clifton merely threw up his chin with an assenting nod, muttering—</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“The popularity-seeking instinct of the diplomatist.” He then conducted</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">her into the drawing-room, led her up its whole length, and seated her</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">upon a sofa with ironical ceremony, saying—</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Mrs. Clifton, you are welcome to White Cliffs.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Startled by his tone, she looked up, lifting those long, drooping</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">lashes, until her soft, dark eyes at last met his cold, rebuking gaze.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Then his whole aspect changed, and from having been sarcastic and</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">scornful, became grave and severe. Standing before her, he folded his</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">arms, drew himself up, and keeping his eyes fixed steadily upon her</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">face, said—</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“And now, lady, listen to me. The aim and object of your life is</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">accomplished—consummated. You have at length attained the position to</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">which you have long aspired, for which you have long and deeply and</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">successfully played. You are numbered among the ladies of the county</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">aristocracy. You bear the haughtiest name of all. You are Mrs. Clifton,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">of Clifton.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">All this time her eyes, wide open, dilated, fascinated by surprise and</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">grief, met his stern gaze in sorrowful wonder, He continued—</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Yes, madam, you wear my name such as it is. You rule my house such as</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">_it_ is! But as for its poor master, lady, he is your most humble</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">servant, but no lover!”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Her eyes fell beneath his sarcastic look, and she was tempted to wish</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">herself dead.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">He continued—</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“I leave here in a few days, for the purpose of raising a company to</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">serve in the coming war with Great Britain. You will remain here at</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">White Cliffs to take charge of affairs during my absence. If you really</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">hoped to flaunt in the city this winter, I am sorry for your</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">disappointment. But there are duties as well as dignities attending the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">position of the mistress of Clifton, and these must not be neglected. I</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">shall exact their performance. The overseer and the farm laborers, as</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">well as the housekeeper and her assistants, have orders to obey you in</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">everything. Good-morning, madam.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">And so abruptly he turned upon his heel and left her. One moment she sat</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">there amazed, confused, with her hands pressed upon her temples; and in</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">another, losing all feeling for herself—feeling only for him, she sprung</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">to his side, and caught his hand, exclaiming—</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Stay! For the love of Heaven, stay! one moment—only one moment, while</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">you tell me. Oh! _after all_, have I made _you_ unhappy?”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Unhappy! You have been and you are the bane of my life!”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“_How?_ Merciful Heaven, _how?_ when I only wish to consecrate mine to</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">you!”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Do you dare to ask me?”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Well!—tell me—tell me! _how_ can I remedy my fault—whatever it is? What</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">can I do to comfort you?”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“_Nothing_ but refrain from troubling me with your company or</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">conversation, when it is not absolutely necessary. Again—good-morning.”</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">And so he freed himself from her clasp, and left the room.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">She tottered backwards and fell into a chair, her head dropped upon her</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">hands and she gasped—</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“All-merciful Father, do not forsake me now, for I am desolate—I am</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">desolate.” And she sat despairing, fallen, the very image of utter</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">self-abandonment. She sat there until aroused by the voice of the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">housekeeper, who entered the room, came up to her side, and spoke to her</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">twice before she heard—then—“What did you say?” she asked.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“I have come to receive your orders for the day, Mrs. Clifton.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“I——Please to manage, to-day, without my advice, I—I am not well—and</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">very, very weary.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“You look so, indeed, madam. There is a fire kindled in your chamber,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">will you go up there and lie down, and let me bring you a cup of tea?”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“I——No, I thank you—I am much obliged to you. But—only leave me here to</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">rest.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">The housekeeper went and closed the shutters: stirred the fire, set a</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">screen between it and Catherine’s seat, and quietly withdrew.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Oh! this will never do!” said Catherine, trying to rouse herself from</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">her stupor of despair. “This will never do. To-day I have made a bad</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">beginning; but to-morrow I must rise and be as active and efficient as</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">if I were happy.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">She met Major Clifton again at dinner. The meal passed almost in</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">silence, and immediately after it was over, he took his hat and left the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">house. She did not see him again until tea-time, after which, he went</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">and spent the evening in his study. Catherine felt the need of calm</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">thought, to understand her position and duties; and of prayer, to gain</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">strength and patience to perform them. She spent several hours in</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">reading the Scriptures, in meditation, and in prayer, and then,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">comforted, retired to bed. She arose early the next morning,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">strengthened and consoled, with a very clear perception of her</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">circumstances and responsibilities.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“My path through this intricate trouble is made very plain. I must</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">discharge every domestic duty and every social obligation, just as</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">faithfully, if not as cheerfully, as though I were a happy wife,” she</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">said. And she went down stairs, and gave her orders for the day.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">When Major Clifton came down into the breakfast-room he found a quiet</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">cheerful scene—a sunny window, a bright fire, a well spread</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">breakfast-table, and Catherine herself, in her simple morning-dress,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">looking calm and placid. There was an expression of curiously blended</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">anger and admiration and amusement on his face, as he flapped his</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">dressing-gown around him, and dropped himself into the easy-chair by the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">fire, giving her “Good-morning,” and hoping that she was well.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“As usual,” replied Catherine, handing him the paper that had just come</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">from the village, and ringing for breakfast.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">When the meal was over, he reseated himself in the arm-chair, reading</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">the newspaper, while Catherine still sat at the board, pouring out bowls</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">of coffee, and filling plates with toast or muffins, to send to the old</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">or sick among the negroes—these being always supplied with their meals</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">from the mistress’s table. Major Clifton glanced over the top of his</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">paper at her, sometimes in irony, sometimes in sorrow, always in doubt.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">And she—unpleasant as his manner was, felt glad to have him near her. I</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">really believe that she had rather he sat there and made faces at her,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">than not sat there at all. And she felt lonesome and dreary when at last</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">he left the room, put on his riding-coat and left the house. As</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">yesterday passed, so passed to-day—she meeting him only at meals. And so</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">a week passed on. It is not easy to be very heroic for a day, or two, or</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">three days; but when one day follows another, each with the same</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">continuous, extraordinary demand for fortitude, it is strange, indeed,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">if heart and flesh do not fail under the task. Nothing but Divine</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Providence can give the requisite strength of endurance. In the presence</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">of her husband, Catherine was calm and cheerful; but often in her</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">private hours the sense of desolate bereavement would come over her, and</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">gusts of tears and sobs would follow. These, like the summer gusts of</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">blessed nature, would always refresh her, and she would be enabled again</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">to take the comforting promises of the Bible to her heart, in her</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">favorite text—“And we know that all things work together for good, to</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">them that love God,” and to ask God’s blessing again upon her resolution</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“to perform every domestic and every social duty as faithfully, if not</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">as cheerfully, as though she were a happy wife.” And yet it was very</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">hard to do this. It was very dreary to feel shut out from her husband’s</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">heart; to meet him every day with the same stern, sorrowful brow, or in</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">variation of that, with the same ironical smile. It was difficult to go</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">on with a repulsed and aching heart doing mere mechanical duty. She</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">could not have done so but that two powerful principles sustained her—an</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">invincible love for her husband, and an unwavering faith in God.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">One morning, about two weeks after their arrival at home, Major Clifton</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">sat alone, reading, in his study, when the door opened, and Catherine</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">entered. It was the first time that she had intruded there, and he</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">looked up, threw aside his book, arose, and pushed back his chair with a</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">look of annoyance.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Excuse me for interrupting you, but may I speak to you for a few</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">minutes?”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Speak on, madam, but oblige me by being brief. Pardon me—take a seat,”</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">he said, handing her a chair, and resuming his own.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Catherine sat down, felt very much like another fit of sobs and tears,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">but restrained herself, and said, quietly—</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Major Clifton, whatever this is between us—”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“I must remind you that this is a prohibited subject of discussion,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">madam,” he said, interrupting her.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“I will not talk of it again—how can I, indeed, when I do not know what</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">it is?”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">He made a gesture of angry disbelief, and begged her to come at once to</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">the object of her visit.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Well, then, I wished only at first to say, that whatever be the cause</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">of this cruel misunderstanding between us, it will pass away. You look</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">at me in surprise and doubt—but it _will_, Major Clifton—it _will_—it</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">_must_—there is no truth and reality in it, and it _must_ be temporary.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">I have thought it all over, very sadly, but very calmly and clearly, and</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">I know that it _must_ be transient. My faith bridges over this</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">impracticable present in our lives, and I see the future, when you will</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">understand me. I never did anything to offend you in my life. And God,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">to whom I have committed our cause, knows my innocence, and in His good</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">time He will make it plain. It must be so. The promise of the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">All-Merciful, the Almighty Father, is pledged to the Right!”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">He turned away from her, with a stamp of fierce displeasure. He turned</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">away from her savagely, because he felt that, had he looked and listened</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">a moment longer, he should have abjured all his evil thoughts, and</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">snatched her to his bosom—she was so patient, so hopeful, so beautiful</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">with truth and love, that he could scarcely resist the impulse to fold</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">her to his heart—false as he deemed her to be. As it was, he suppressed</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">the true instinct—obeyed the false suspicion, and turning again sharply</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">upon her, demanded to know, once for all, to what this new piece of</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">hypocrisy tended.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“I mean this, Major Clifton—that as our estrangement must needs be</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">transient—do not, under its influence, let us do, or omit to do,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">anything that may hereafter affect, unhappily, our social relations with</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">others.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“As——_how_, Mrs. Clifton?”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“_Thus._ The county families have all called upon us. It is high time</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">that we return their visits, if we mean to keep up the connection.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Oh! Ay! Excellently well thought of, Maria Teresa!” he sneered.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">With a passing look of distress, she said—</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“I only fear that our pleasant intercourse with the neighbors may not be</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">so easily resumed, if they have reason to suppose that we treat them</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">with indifference and neglect.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Admirably calculated, madam! A contingency has presented itself to your</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">diplomatic wisdom, that never would have occurred to my simpler mind.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">So, you wish to confirm your position, and extend your connection here</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">in the county! Well! the aristocrats of R——, have certainly taken you up</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">with a zeal and determination that is surprising. But when they have</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">once made up their haughty minds to patronize a new comer, it is</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">wonderful to what length they will go. But you may thank your own fine</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">diplomatic talents for that!”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Diplomatic talents! What diplomatic talents? So many people have</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">‘thrust’ that questionable ‘greatness’ upon me, that it mortifies me.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">No—I know the only value and currency I have among the county people, is</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">the value you have given me—the stamps of your name and rank. And I—I do</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">not wish to disparage it. I wish to appear worthy of it—that is all.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“And you really believe what you say?”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Truly, I do.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Again she looked so lovely, in her truth and humility, that he was</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">almost tempted to relent. And again the impulse only made him more</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">unjust.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“In a word, madam, what do you wish me to do, for I begin to weary of</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">this discussion. Nor is it well to subject myself to the influence of</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">your fascinations, for I candidly admit to you that I am sensible of</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">them, as others have been.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“I only wished to propose to you to take a day, and drive around the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">neighborhood with me, to return the calls that have been made upon us.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Very well, madam, I am at your commands whenever you please to call</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">upon me for that service. When do you propose to go?”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“At your earliest convenience.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Will to-morrow do?”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“If you please.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“To-morrow then let it be. And now, Mrs. Clifton, have you any further</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">commands for me?”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Thank you—no,” she answered, very sadly, and turned to leave the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">room—hesitated, came back, and resting her hand upon the study-table for</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">support, because she was trembling, said, “Forgive me—and let me speak</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">to you one more word, will you?”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“What is it?”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“It is so sorrowful to be misunderstood. Please, do not mistake me in</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">this matter. For myself, I do not care to follow up my acquaintance with</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">these county people. I have lived all my life without extensive social</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">intercourse. I have lived all my life in strict domestic retirement. I</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">am so used to it that it is natural and agreeable to me. Indeed, I</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">prefer it—but—”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Well?”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">She was suddenly silent. She wished to say, “But with _you_ it is</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">otherwise. Living in the county, _you_ need, or will hereafter need an</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">extensive neighborhood connection. And for _your_ sake, I would not</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">alienate these people by neglect.” But she could not say it. Her old</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">shyness, and a delicate fear of seeming to wish to place him under an</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">obligation, kept her mute.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Well, Mrs. Clifton? If such seclusion is so agreeable to you, why do</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">you wish to change it?”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“I owe the ladies some acknowledgment of their civility to us.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Have you anything farther to say to me?”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“No,” said Catherine, and with an involuntary gesture of pain and</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">distress, she turned and left the room, with all her generous thoughts</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">unspoken. When the door had closed behind her, Archer Clifton started</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">up, struck his clenched hands to his forehead, and pacing up and down</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">the floor, distractedly exclaimed—</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“I love her! I love her! It is no use, I _do_ love her! Every day more</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">deeply and desperately I love her! In her presence all her unworthiness</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">is forgotten or disbelieved! Yes! yes! her deep hypocrisy, her black</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">ingratitude, my mother’s wrongs, all, all are lost to memory! Just now I</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">could have snatched her to my bosom and wept over her falsehood, rather</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">than have cast her from me! Yes, more! I could have implored her</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">forgiveness for ever believing in that guilt which is but too well</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">proved! I love her! She is the pulse of my heart! the soul of my life!</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">She embodies all the meaning of existence to me! Heart and</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">brain—yes!—body, soul and spirit starve, perish for a full</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">reconciliation and a perfect union with her! She is lovely, she is</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">beautiful to me! She always was! Yet, oh! Apple of Sodom, that she is!</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">shall I take such falsehood and corruption to my heart. I must leave the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">house! must leave the neighborhood! for here I wilt and wither! And she!</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">how _can_ she bear it? for I think, with all her falseness, she loves me</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">very much. How _can_ she bear life so? How can she rise each morning and</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">go through all the occupations of the day so regularly, quietly,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">cheerfully, day after day?—omitting no duty, domestic or social, small</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">or great, from the stitching my ripped gloves, to the keeping up of the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">county connection, in sooth! While _I_, I daily wilt, wither, in this</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">moral mildew—idle, despairing, forgetting all my obligations—forgetting</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">that my country needs my arm! This cannot last! This must not be! I must</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">get away from here! I must raise a volunteer company, and offer myself</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">to the government, and in the tumult of the campaign find forgetfulness</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">or a grave!”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Unable to compose himself again that morning, he rang the bell, ordered</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">his horse, seized his hat, went out, mounted, and rode away.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">The next morning Catherine arose early, and among her orders for the day</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">directed that the carriage should be at the door by ten o’clock. At the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">appointed hour she attired herself with care and taste, and went down</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">into the front hall, where she found Major Clifton in readiness to</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">attend her. They entered the carriage and set out, and in the course of</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">a drive of five or six hours’ duration, made the circuit of the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">neighborhood, calling upon several families. And everywhere Catherine</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">was received with distinguished respect. They reached home again about</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">the middle of the afternoon.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">The next few days passed on in the usual dreary routine—except that</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Catherine knew Major Clifton was out riding every day and all day, and</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">that he was in his study writing half the night. She did not know what</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">this portended until one morning he said to her—</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Mrs. Clifton, you will oblige me by having my wardrobe prepared and</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">packed at your earliest convenience. I have orders to join the ——</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">regiment within a week.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Catherine turned very pale and reeled as if she would have fallen, but</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">grasped the chair and steadied herself, till strength returned.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“All shall be ready for you,” she replied.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">And he, with a cold bow of acknowledgment, went his way.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2"><span class="Apple-converted-space">                            </span>CHAPTER XXXIII.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2"><span class="Apple-converted-space">                         </span>“THE MEEKNESS OF LOVE”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2"><span class="Apple-converted-space">                </span>So she strove against her weakness,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2"><span class="Apple-converted-space">                  </span>Though at times her spirit sank;</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2"><span class="Apple-converted-space">                </span>Shaped her heart with woman’s meekness,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2"><span class="Apple-converted-space">                  </span>To all duties of her rank.—TENNYSON.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Catherine remained seated in the chair into which she had sunk, with her</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">face buried in her open palms. Her favorite maid Henny, from the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Hardbargain farm-house, was in attendance. Henny had cleared away the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">breakfast service, with the exception of the silver plate, which was</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">collected upon a salver; and she stood by her mistress’s chair waiting,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">in respectful sympathy; at last she said—</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Miss Kate, honey, if you lend me the keys o’ the plate closet, I can</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">put away the things safe, without your troublin’ o’ yourself.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Catherine lifted her head languidly, and pushing away her drooping hair,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">exclaimed, quite unconsciously, and as if the words burst of themselves</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">from her overburdened bosom—</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Oh! Henny, if you knew how little heart I have to do anything!”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“I _does_ know it, mist’ess, deary; but you mus’ jes take a ’flection on</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">to it, honey, an’ ’sider how it ain’t on’y marster, but mos’ in general</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">all the gemmum in the neighborhood, as is gwine far the wars.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Regretting that she had permitted a complaint to escape her lips, yet</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">satisfied that her servant did not understand or suspect the true cause</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">of her sorrow, Catherine arose, and said—</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Take up the salver and follow me, Henny. Idle grief is very fruitless.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">If we cannot keep our friends with us, it is better to prepare for their</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">comfortable living while absent, than to sit down in useless sorrow.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“An’ that’s the Lord’s trufe, Miss Kate,” said Henny lifting the laden</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">salver on her head, and settling it steadily, “that’s Marster blessed</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">trufe! ’Sides which, I has a heap to do myself, to get brother Jack’s</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">duds ready, to go long o’ Marse Archy.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Is your brother going with Major Clifton, Henny?”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“’Deed he is, honey—gwine to ride body-servant long o’ marster, to wait</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">on him in camp; likewise in field o’ battle, to hold his t’other horse,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">in case his whichest one should be shot unnerneaf of him—Oh, Lord</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Marster Jesus! what a thing that is to think of! Likewise in soldier’s</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">newniform, on the bay horse Billy, which brother Jack would sell his</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">mortal soul any time, for the sake o’ dressing fine, an’ ridin’ a</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">horseback—cussed, infunnelly fool!—I axes your pardon, Miss Kate; don’t</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">look so ’noyed, honey; I won’t use bad words again—’deed, ’fore my</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">blessed, Hebbenly Marster won’t I, honey; but it is so aggravoking, when</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">I comes to think o’ what a slave I’ve made o’ myself to brother Jack,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">ever since mother died, and the ’turn he makes me for it, wantin’ to go</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">gallivauntin’ off to the wars in soldier’s clothes, an’ a long tailed</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">horse! Here has I been ’jecting some o’ the most illegible colored men</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">in the neighborhood, an’ bein’ of an old maid, sake o’ takin’ care o’</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">him, ’cause he’s delicy in his health, an’ he to be wantin’ to go leave</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">me! An’ he, with a ’sumption in his breas’, to want to go; ’sposing of</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">hisself gettin’ his feet wet sogerin’! An’ he ’blige to wear a tar</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">plaster on his ches’, to be campin’ out an’ layin’ on the naked yeth!</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">An’ knows he can’t congest nothin’ but rabbits an’ partridges, an’ wants</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">to go where he’ll have to live offen roas’ tators, like Gin’al Marion</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">an’ his men, in the Resolutionary War! It mos’—mos’—mos’—breaks my</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">heart!”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">And with that Henny set down the salver and began to cry, while her</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">mistress opened the plate closet.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Put them in, Henny, and I will see what can be done for you</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">afterwards,” said Catherine.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Henny obeyed, and then said, as they left the room—</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“If you could ’suade Marse Archy to leave poor Jack, poor sickly fellow,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">at home, an’ take some o’ the other young niggers. Der ain’t one o’ them</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">but ’ould be ’joyed to go. Der’s Dandy now, ’ould be willin’ to go to</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">his everlastin’ ruination, ’sake o’ ridin’ body-sarvant long o’</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">marster—”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“I will speak to Major Clifton, Henny. You know him to be kind and</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">considerate. And I am sure, he is not aware of Jack’s pulmonary</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">affection.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Yes he is, Miss Kate, honey! ’Deed he knows all about Jack’s ’fection</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">for him! High, honey! ain’t Jack been own man to Marse Archy ever since</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">they was boys together? An’ didn’t Jack wait on him when he wur at</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">college, and ole Mist pay extra for him? ’Deed she did, honey! ’Fore my</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">blessed Hebbenly Lord, did she! An’ he knows all ’bout Jack’s ’fection</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">for him, and he knows Jack ’ould follow him to the ind o’ the world, an’</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">jump off arter him! Lord love your heart, Miss Kate, ther ain’t no dog</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">marster’s got, loves him more faithful ’an brother Jack does.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Kate sighed very deeply, with a preoccupied air, but answered—</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“I will speak to Major Clifton in your behalf, Henny—now go and ask Mrs.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Mercer to come to me in my own chamber.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">And Catherine passed on to her own apartment, and Henny went her errand.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Very soon the housekeeper entered the chamber, and found Catherine</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">busily engaged among linen, stockings, cravats, and other “belongings.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“I want your assistance, Mrs. Mercer, in preparing Major Clifton’s</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">wardrobe this week.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“My dear child, I am so sorry! But I have been waiting for an hour to</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">speak to you. The truth is, I have just got a letter from my son-in-law,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">who writes that my daughter is very, extremely low, with the bilious</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">pleurisy, and wants me to come right over to L—— immediately, without</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">loss of time, and I thought I would ask you for a leave of absence, till</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">she got better.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“And, certainly, I could not refuse it, Mrs. Mercer. I am sorry your</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">daughter is ill.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“And, my dear child, I was going to ask you if you could let me have one</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">of the mules this morning, and I would send it back to-morrow?”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“The weather is too cold, and the journey too arduous for a woman of</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">your age to perform it in that manner. Tell Dandy to put the horses to</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">the carriage for you.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“The carriage, dear honey, I shouldn’t think of such a thing. As many</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">years as I have been living in the family, I never used the carriage</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">once. The mule will do very well, if you will let me order him?”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Mrs. Mercer, why not? I shall not want it to-day. To-morrow Dandy can</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">bring it home.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“God bless you, child! you are so good hearted! It is a sin too to leave</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">you, so thronged as you are with work.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“No, I can get—get through,” replied Kate, with the same troubled,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">preoccupied air that had marked her manner the whole morning. Mrs.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Mercer soon after took leave and departed.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">An hour after this, Catherine heard Major Clifton enter the hall door</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">and come up stairs. To her surprise, he paused before her chamber door</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">and rapped. When she opened it, he said—</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Will you favor me with your company in my study for a few minutes, Mrs.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Clifton?”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Catherine immediately laid down her work and followed him.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">When they reached the study, he set her a chair near the writing-table,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">and dropping into another, drew a portfolio before him, opened it, and</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">turning out a number of papers, said—</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Mrs. Clifton, I told you, some weeks since, that at my departure, and</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">during my indefinite absence, I should be obliged to leave this estate</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">under your charge?”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Yes,” answered Catherine attentively.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“I am well aware that it is undoubtedly an onerous burden and</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">responsibility for one so young, but, when you feel it so, remember that</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">you, yourself, courted the position, and must be content to take the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">toils with the honors, real or imaginary.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Passing over his bitter jibe, Catherine said—</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“You need not doubt in leaving all to my care that all will go well. I</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">am not twenty yet, it is true, but I have had much work and much</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">experience for my age, so that every year I have lived since ten years</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">old has counted double. You need suffer no anxiety in trusting me.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">He looked at her countenance, at once noble and meek in expression; he</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">remembered the life of toil, self-denial, and devotion she had lived; he</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">even recollected a certain text of Scripture which said, “By their</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">_fruits_ ye shall know them—do men gather _thorns_ of _fig trees_?” but</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">the demon of cherished suspicion whispered, “’Twas all done for a</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">purpose,” and he hardened his heart, and replied—</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Oh! madam, I have no doubt or hesitation in placing the plantation</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">under your care, and I shall have no anxiety in leaving it so for an</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">indefinite period; not only because I have much faith in your natural</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">talents and acquired experience, but, also, because I have more</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">confidence in your self-love. And knowing that _you_ know our interests</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">in the prosperity of this estate to be identical, I rest assured that</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">you will do for it your very best.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“He—in all other circumstances, and to all other people—so noble, so</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">liberal, so charitable—he never speaks to me but to upbraid me!” was the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">thought that presented itself to Catherine’s mind, but with the loyalty</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">of her nature she repelled it, saying, within herself, “It is because he</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">has what he thinks condemning evidence of my unworthiness—would he but</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">charge me! would he but tell me what it is?”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Will you give me your attention, Mrs. Clifton?” he asked, breaking into</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">her sad reverie.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Catherine bowed gently.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">And he took down the “farm-book” from a shelf, opened it, and laying it</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">before her, entered upon a series of details and explanations on both</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">debt and credit sides of the accounts, with which it is not necessary to</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">trouble the reader. After two or three hours spent in looking over</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">bills, comparing them with receipts, calculating results, etc., he</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">closed the book, replaced the papers in the portfolio, clasped it, and</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">turning around to Catherine, said—</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“You understand, now?”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Yes, perfectly.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“As for these heavy notes that will fall due the first of January, you</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">must contrive an interview with the holders, and get them renewed upon</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">security—as I said before, remember.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“I shall not forget.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“No, or if you do, the holders of the notes will bring them to your</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">recollection in not the pleasantest manner. And now, Mrs. Clifton, I</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">wish you to keep a vigilant eye over Turnbull, and hold him to a strict</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">account. I _suspect_ the man. I never have been able to understand how,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">with such a heavy force of negroes on this plantation, it has been</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">necessary to hire about a baker’s dozen of white laborers, all of them,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">you understand, his own relations—brothers, sons, and nephews! I have</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">reason to mistrust the fellow, but no time to look after him. Hold him</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">to a strict account, Catherine.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Suppose, for the coming year, you should place my brother Carl here as</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">overseer? You have tested his skill and probity.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">This was a very unlucky proposition on Catherine’s part. He sat back in</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">his chair, and looking at her in steady scorn, said—</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Yes, madam, I _have_ ‘tested his skill and probity,’ and know so well</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">the degree of the former, and the quality of the latter, that I have</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">already forbid him to set foot on my premises or speak to my wife. Do</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">you dare to think that I am your dupe, or his? And now, hear me: In all</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">the directions that I have given you, I have simply desired or requested</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">you to do this or that, but in this matter of your perfidious brother</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Carl, I _command_ you to hold no intercourse with him whatever.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“You shall be obeyed,” said Catherine, “you shall be obeyed,” and she</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">thought—“Your simplest wish, expressed to that effect, would have had</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">all the power of this arbitrary command,”—but she did not say it. She</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">was never free of speech, least of all to him. And now he arose, as if</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">to conclude the interview. And she recollected her promise to Henny, to</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">intercede for Jack, and always more courageous in the cause of any, even</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">the humblest, than in her own, she gently detained him, by saying—“I</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">wished to speak to you about the servant you intend to take with you.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Jack?”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Yes. You were not home last winter, and you do not know that he was</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">sick with a cough the whole winter, and that he is consumptive.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“I have sometimes thought so, however! Well?”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Indeed I feel that it is properly no business of mine, and I beg you</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">will excuse my interference. I would not willingly, I am sure—”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“To the point, if you please, Mrs. Clifton.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Well, I am afraid that if you take him, and expose him to the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">unavoidable hardships of campaign life, he will fall sick on your hands,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">and instead of being a help, be a hindrance. Therefore it is much more</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">for your sake than for the boy’s own, that I should be pleased if you</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">would leave him here and take another.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“There is much reason in what you have advanced, Mrs. Clifton. Yet,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">among all the negroes on the place, there is none but Jack who seems fit</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">for the duty, the others are all too young or too old, or too hopelessly</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">stupid and lumbering.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“There is Dandy, a handsome, likely mulatto, strong and intelligent,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">dressy and enterprising, the very man for an officer’s servant; he would</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">be very proud and glad to attend you.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Oh! ay! I know that he is anxious to go; but he is your carriage-driver</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">and waiter, Catherine, and I cannot think of depriving you of him.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“There are other careful drivers on the place. Please take him with</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">you.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Yes—but those other careful drivers are awkward, ill-looking,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">farm-laborers, accustomed to driving and hallooing after ox-teams.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Have I been so long used to a carriage, as to be choice in my coachman,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">then? Please do not think of that.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“And then he is your waiter and messenger.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Oh, believe me, I do not need him. Pray take him with you. He is so</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">active, intelligent and faithful, that he will be of inestimable value</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">to you in the campaign.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“It is precisely because he is so active, intelligent and faithful, that</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">I am unwilling to deprive you of his services, Catherine—I beg your</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">pardon—_Mrs. Clifton_,” he corrected himself, suddenly changing his</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">involuntarily relenting manner into the old sarcasm and scorn.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Oh, call me Catherine, please call me Catherine,” she said, losing half</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">her reserve.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Why? Do you dislike the other name?”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“No—I like it. I am proud of it—not because it is a high, haughty name,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">but because it is _yours_. When other people call me ‘Mrs. Clifton,’ my</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">heart springs with pride and joy, but when you call me so—”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Ah, now, do not let us grow sentimental, madam! I prefer to call you</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Mrs. Clifton because I think that the fancied dignity for which you have</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">toiled and plotted so long, and patiently, and successfully, should be</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">constantly brought to your mind.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">With a deprecating, imploring gesture, and a brow crimsoned until the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">purple veins started out, Catherine, pierced by this keen sarcasm, sank</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">into a chair.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Unpityingly, he added—</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“And now, Mrs. Clifton, I really must entreat you to excuse me. I expect</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Turnbull here, every instant, to have a talk about the stock.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Catherine arose, trembling, and left the room; one agonized complaint</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">bursting from her tortured bosom—</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Oh, I would to Heaven this were over—some way!”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">He looked after her, with a countenance convulsed with sorrow, groaning—</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“_And so would I!_ And so would I to God that this were over—_somehow_!</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Oh!” he thought, rising again, and pacing the floor—“there is nothing in</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">life so humiliating to an honorable-minded man, as to love and live with</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">a perfidious woman—to be daily tempted by his own heart and her</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">blandishment, to become her dupe and his own scorn! To be hourly on the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">brink of clasping just so much proved treachery as her form conceals, to</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">a half loving, half loathing bosom! Serpents! Yes, I dreamed of a</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">serpent, last night:—methought I was in the forests of Brazil, and the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">fatal cobra-di-capello had coiled itself around my neck, and raised its</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">horrid head to mine, and I went to snatch the deadly reptile away, and</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">found it to be only Catherine’s gentle arms and noble face. Devils!</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Never did a demon hide itself under a more deceptive form and face!—with</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">that saint-like blending of nobility and meekness in her countenance.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Every time she talks with me, she brings me to the very brink of</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">abjuring my sincere convictions. I must get away from this place, or my</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">mind will become unsettled, deranged. I must hasten my departure, and in</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">the meantime, she shall not talk with me again. She shall not cross the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">threshold of this room again, or if she does, she shall meet with such a</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">reception that she shall speedily retire.” And so, torn with passion, he</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">walked and raved, while Catherine sought her room, and threw herself</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">upon the bed, giving way to a burst of tears and sobs, and crying, in</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">wild rebellion—</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“God! Oh, God! Infinite in power and love—do You see me? Do You see me,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">and withhold Your help? Oh, God! God!” But soon upon her fevered spirit</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">fell the word of the Lord like dew—“All things work together for good,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">to them that love the Lord.” And full of penitence for her impatience,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">she knelt, and humbled herself “under the mighty hand of God.” And then,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">comforted with love and hope, strengthened with faith and courage, she</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">arose, and went about her work.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Meeting Henny soon after, she told her to be consoled, for that she</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">thought Jack would be let off.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">In the afternoon she received a pencilled note from Major Clifton,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">announcing that he should leave home three days sooner than he had</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">anticipated, namely, on the third day from that date. Leaning against</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">the projecting chimney piece, she held the note, stupidly gazing at it.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">But two days were left before he should depart then—she thought—and he</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">was going, really going upon a long and perilous military service, and</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">parting with her in deep, unmitigated anger, under the seemingly</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">ineffaceable impression of her utter unworthiness—believing her to be</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">guilty of—what? ay! what? for up to this moment she had not the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">slightest idea of his reason for condemning her. And now she blamed</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">herself for cowardice, in having hesitated to entreat him to inform her</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">of what fault or crime she was suspected, and to give her the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">opportunity of exculpating herself. And she reproached herself for that</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">failing of the heart, and falling of the eyes, and faltering of the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">voice, that made her so powerless, and placed her at such a disadvantage</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">in his presence. “Oh, yes, indeed,” she said, “I know my manner is</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">enough to convict me; I do not wonder at nor blame him for thinking ill</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">of me, so long as my eyes sink beneath his look. But how can I help it.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">It must be so while he frowns or sneers. One encouraging word or glance</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">from him, and I could look up and speak.” And next she remembered how</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">much he must suffer in continuing to think her unworthy, and in</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">departing under that impression—and at this thought, all that was most</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">generous and benevolent in her nature arose to inspire her with courage,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">and she resolved to go to him, and, though heart and frame should</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">tremble to meet that dread look of stern sorrow or piercing scorn—to</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">persevere in imploring him to tell her with what crime she stood</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">charged.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">But though she had determined upon this act, it was extremely difficult</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">to perform it. All the afternoon and evening he came and went in such</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">hurry, and seemed so entrenched behind his own private thoughts and</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">purposes that she feared to break in upon his reserve. Once indeed for</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">the purpose of speaking to him upon the subject, she entered his study,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">and stood by the table; but he turned around, drew himself up, sat back</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">in his chair, and looked upon her with such sarcastic arrogance, that,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">abashed and confounded, without opening her lips she turned and left the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">room.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">And so the afternoon and evening passed, and the next day, the last of</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">his stay, arrived. All day Catherine sought an opportunity of speaking</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">with him alone. In vain! He was resolved to afford her none. He</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">sedulously avoided her. As a last resort she wrote a note, requesting an</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">interview, and sent it to him. She received an answer stating that his</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">time for the day was all pre-engaged. And so this last day also passed.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">That night she completed her part in the preparations for his departure,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">and retired late to a sleepless bed. She heard him come in very late,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">and enter his room, which joined her own.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">At early dawn she arose and looked at the time-piece on her chamber</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">mantle-shelf. It was but five o’clock. He was not to leave till ten.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">There were five precious hours left yet. And oh! how inestimably</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">precious, if in them she could effect a reconciliation with her husband.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">They were like the last hours of a dying one, with salvation staked upon</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">them. She felt that the crisis had come, that she must not falter now.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">She knelt and prayed for strength and courage, as we only pray a few</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">times in life—with that impassioned earnestness of supplication that</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">ever brings an angel down “strengthening” us. Then, encouraged, she</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">arose, completed her simple toilet, and went down stairs to her morning</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">duties. The breakfast hour was seven. And oh, she watched the clock as</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">she, unjustly condemned to death, might watch in the last fleeting hours</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">preceding execution—hoping, still hoping for some saving revelation. A</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">little while after seven he came down stairs, entered the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">breakfast-room, and bowing with his usual cold greeting of—</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Good-morning, madam,” sat down.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">She rang for the coffee, and then took her place at the head of the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">table.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">He went through with the morning meal, with his customary, reflective</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">leisure. And Catherine watched the hand of the clock, as it traveled on</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">towards eight. She was sick with apprehension. She could not speak to</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">him there, for the servants were in attendance. At last he arose, left</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">the table, and went out to give some final directions concerning his</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">baggage, and the horses and servants he was to take with him. And then</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">he went up stairs and entered his study. It was just eight o’clock, and</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">she had two invaluable hours left yet. As if life and death hung upon</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">their issue, she resolved come what might, to use them in a final effort</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">for a reconciliation. Pale and trembling in every limb, she left the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">table, and went up stairs, slowly, holding by the balustrades from</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">weakness. When she reached the study door she found it ajar, and through</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">it she saw him sitting at his writing-table—not busy, as she had feared</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">and expected to find him, but doing absolutely nothing—with his elbows</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">resting on the table, and his face buried in the palms of his hands—in</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">the attitude and expression of the deepest sorrow and despair. That one</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">glimpse of his suffering face, sufficed to drive every fear but that of</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">anxious affection from her heart—“It is because he thinks me unworthy. I</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">must not leave him to think so longer. Be strong, coward heart,” she</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">said, to herself, and then she went in and stood beside his chair,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">resting her hand, for support, upon the table, trembling with nervous</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">weakness, and blushing with the bashfulness she could not but feel in</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">making this advance, and altogether, in his suspicious eyes, looking</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">very much like a conscious culprit. She stood, unable to utter one word,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">until he lifted up his head, and seeing her, demanded coldly—</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“What is your pleasure, Mrs. Clifton?”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">She attempted to speak, but a mute sob was all that ensued.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">With a piercing sarcasm, he asked—</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Can I serve you in any manner this morning, madam?”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">With a gesture of deprecation and entreaty, she answered—</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Yes! yes! I wish to be put upon my trial! Archer!—Major Clifton! you</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">withdrew your favor from me so suddenly! You never told me why! Oh! tell</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">me, before you go, how I have been so wretched as to lose your</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">esteem—and put me upon my defence.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">He frowned, darkly, as with both pain and anger, and replied—</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“I have had occasion twice before to remind you, Mrs. Clifton, that this</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">is a prohibited subject of conversation between us.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">She clasped her hands, in the earnestness of supplication, exclaiming—</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Why? Oh! why? You were always just. You never judged your poorest</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">slave, unheard! Oh! what have I done, or omitted to do? Tell me! Make</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">the charge, and see how I can answer it! Archer!—I mean Major</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Clifton—forgive it—but for all, it springs so naturally from heart to</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">lip, to call you Archer—because—because there is no feeling of</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">estrangement in my heart, nor can I make it there! Major Clifton,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">then!—consider!—the greatest criminals have the right of a trial, with</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">the crime of which they are suspected, distinctly and openly charged</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">upon them—with the evidence on both sides taken, and their defence</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">heard, before they are condemned. I know that you would not be otherwise</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">than just. Will you condemn me untried, unjudged, unheard?”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“It is quite sufficient to me, madam,” he answered, haughtily, “that the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">proofs of your turpitude are conclusive to my own mind.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“I know it,” she said, meekly, “I know it—yet, pause—what would you</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">think of the justice of a judge, who should say to one suspected of</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">crime—‘Your guilt is so clear, that it is useless to charge you with it,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">or to hear the testimony, or to listen to what you might have to say in</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">your defence,’ and so proceed to condemn him? Such things were never,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">surely, done, in the darkest ages, or under the most despotic rulers.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">And is that guilt, of which I am suspected, of so heinous a character as</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">to preclude me from the privilege extended even to criminals—the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">privilege of a trial?” She paused—but he continued to regard her with a</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">stern, set face, without replying. Drooping over the table, and leaning</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">heavily upon it, she spoke again, and her voice fell in low, but clear,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">melodious tones, as she said—“God and man, and I, myself, have made you</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">my judge, and the arbiter of my destiny here. It is an awful power. You</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">have made me feel it to be such. It is an awful power, because it is a</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">subtile, invisible power—higher, and deeper, and broader than any law. I</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">have no appeal from it—none! Nor—please to understand me—do I wish for</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">any—for if all the world were to clear me, I should still be condemned,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">if you condemned me. And oh! listen, and believe me—believe me, for it</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">is from my deep heart that I speak this truth—if you had the power and</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">the will to doom me to death—my instincts would teach me rather to</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">receive death at your hands, than to save my life by appealing from your</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">judgment to another tribunal. I am loyal. I am faithful! God knoweth</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">that I am. Let me prove it. Put me upon my defence. Do not—oh, do not</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">persist in condemning me, unheard.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Catherine,” he answered, in a softened voice—“you are not condemned; if</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">you were, you would not be standing here at my side.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“What do you mean? good Heaven!”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“THIS,” he replied with a sudden change of manner, as though angry with</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">himself for his transient relenting. “This! that oftentimes it happens</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">that the only mercy we can show the guilty, is _not_ to bring them to</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">trial! To openly recognize guilt, is to be obliged to punish it. If we</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">distinctly accuse, we are bound to prove, and if we prove, to condemn</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">and sentence.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“And is my case such a one?”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Your case is such a one.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Yet still I beg to be tried! For if _not_ to try them is often the only</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">way to save the guilty, to _try_ them is oftener the only way to clear</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">the innocent. Accuse me—hear my defence, and be yourself my judge. I ask</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">no other.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Of what avail were it to rehearse your acts of falsehood and treachery.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">You know them this moment even better than I do.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Falsehood and treachery—just Heaven!”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Yes, madam, those were the words I used.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“You are mistaken in attributing such wickedness to me but tell me the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">grounds of your suspicions; doubtless I can explain them, and clear</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">myself.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">He laughed a scornful, sardonic laugh, and replied, “Oh, doubtless a</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">woman of your diplomatic genius is fertile in explanations. Whether you</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">could by possibility clear yourself, is another question; for I</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">speak—not of suspicions but of positive knowledge.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">His strong conviction of her turpitude infected her with despair at</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">last. She said, very mournfully—</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“I know that it has sometimes happened that the innocent have been tried</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">and convicted—overwhelmed by a mass of circumstantial evidence—and that</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">may be my case; nevertheless, even they have had the poor satisfaction</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">of knowing for what they suffered. Tell me, I beseech you. I will still</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">hope that I can acquit myself. Not for my own sake, Archer, dear</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Archer—but for yours: it must be so agonizing to be forced to think ill</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">of one we have loved as you once loved me. I suffer very much in the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">loss of your esteem, but were it possible for our cases to be</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">reversed—were I forced to think evil of you, I do not know, indeed I do</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">not know how I could go on with daily life at all!”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“I think you had better cease discoursing and retire, your diplomatic</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">talent is not in high action this morning; you permit your words to</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">betray you.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“To betray me!”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Yes, madam; for if you felt yourself to be innocent, would you not</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">necessarily think very ill of me for treating you as a guilty woman?”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“No! no! I know that to have condemned me so promptly, so unequivocally,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">you must have, what you think, proof positive against me. But produce</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">it! I am innocent; indeed I am, Archer. I believe in Heaven’s justice. I</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">believe that if I call on the Lord, He will sooner or later, in His own</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">good time, enable me to prove it.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“I _will_ produce the testimony,” he said, going to an escritoir,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">opening it and taking from it a note in a gray envelope. Returning to</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">his seat, he laid it before her, asking “Is this your hand-writing?”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Catherine glanced at it—it was the envelope she had directed to Mrs.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Georgia Clifton, and she immediately answered—</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Yes, certainly it is.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Ah! it is; when was it written?”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“The last day of your dear mother’s life. Ah! now I remember, it was</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">from that day you took your favor from me.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Yes, madam,” he said, withdrawing the fatal note from the envelope, and</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">laying it before her, adding, “Do you acknowledge _this_ as your writing</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">also?”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Catherine looked at the note without heeding the words, and raising her</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">innocent eyes with wonder to his face, answered, without an instant’s</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">hesitation—</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Yes, assuredly, that is mine!”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Her perfect unconsciousness should have convinced him of her</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">innocence—would have done so perhaps, but that, prejudiced against her,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">he took her manner to be super-refined art; and determined to force her</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">to the point, he said—</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Would you swear it?”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Catherine took up the letter and examined it.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Ay! read it, read it.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Catherine read the note, turned deadly pale, fell back in her chair, and</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">let the paper drop from her hands—overwhelmed by the enormous wickedness</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">of the forgery. Scarcely restraining a bitter curse, he picked up the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">fatal note, pushed the door open with his foot, crossed the hall, and</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">entered his bed-chamber, banging the door after him.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">One stunned moment she sat thus, then started to her feet, bewildered,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">distracted, and with a wild impulse, fled across the hall and into his</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">chamber, and sank at his feet speechless, mute, but catching his hand,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">and clinging to it. When she struggled and recovered her voice, she</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">exclaimed, simply—</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“I did not write that letter, Archer. I did not write that letter.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">He twisted his hand rudely out of her grasp, and turned away, without</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">reply.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">She clasped her hands earnestly, exclaiming again—</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“I did not write that letter! It is impossible I ever should have</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">conceived, much less have written such a letter! I do not know who wrote</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">it. I never laid my eyes on it before!”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">An incredulous, insulting smile, was his reply.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Oh! what shall I say to convince you? _Indeed_, _indeed_ I did not do</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">it!”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Come, perjure yourself! Swear it.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">She was silent.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“I ask you to swear it.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">She was still silent.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Come, now—will you declare upon oath that you did not write that</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">letter?”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“God sees me! I did not!”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“That’s no oath! Here’s the New Testament, swear upon the Holy</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Evangelists of Almighty God that you didn’t write it, and, perhaps, I</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">will believe you, for well I know that many unprincipled people have a</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">sort of fearful respect for an oath, which in them is not piety, but</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">superstition. I think you just such a one! Come, now, swear that you did</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">not write it!” He paused for an answer, but she looked at him in great</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">trouble. “Will you do it?”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Major Clifton, I cannot!”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Not swear that you did not write it?”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“No, sir.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Then that only confirms and seals the truth of what I knew before,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">that, of course, you _did_ write it.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">She wrung her hands in deep distress, and said—</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“I cannot swear, Archer. I mean I _dare_ not swear, Archer, even to</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">prove my innocence, and get back your love.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“And why, pray?” he asked, with a mocking smile.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Oh, Archer! my Lord and yours has commanded us to ‘_Swear not at all_.’</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">I dare not break that command.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Tush, girl, you are clumsy. Do you presume to think I can be duped by</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">that affectation of super-righteousness?”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Oh, Heaven! Oh, Heaven! what shall I do?” said Catherine, in despair.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Swear, and I will believe you,” he answered, mockingly.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Oh! _why_ will not my simple word do? Oh! do you think I would tell a</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">falsehood even to save my life?”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Do I? Does not an astute diplomatist, like you, know that _I_ know a</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">woman who can be false, treacherous, hypocritical;—who, so young, can</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">plot so well, and succeed so entirely;—can also tell a falsehood to</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">conceal her baseness?” he answered, looking down upon her in</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">insufferable scorn.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Then her whole manner changed. She arose to her feet with a certain calm</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">and gentle dignity, and pushing back the veiling tresses from her noble</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">brow, answered nobly—</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Yes, it is true! If I could have conceived such treachery, and written</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">such a letter as that, I could also have lied to conceal it! There is</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">only one on earth that knows my innocence, the writer of that letter.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">But one in Heaven knows it, and He will make it manifest. I believe in</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">miracles, because I believe in the infinite power and goodness of God,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">and in the everlasting promises of the Bible.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Well done, Maria Teresa! really that is the best of all! Indeed, your</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">talents are quite lost upon such unworthy game as me and my poor</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">estate—good-bye!” And laughing bitterly, he left the room, and hurried</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">down stairs. A few minutes after she heard the clock strike ten—then she</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">arose and went to the window to look out. He stood upon the lawn, in</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">riding gear, near a group consisting of his servant Dandy, and three</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">saddle-horses. She saw him vault into his saddle, and ride away,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">attended by Dandy, mounted on one horse and leading another. As he</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">passed the outer gate, one look of love, sorrow, and despair, he turned</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">towards her window, and then vanished into the forest road.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">She did not see that look—she could not have seen it at that distance;</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">she saw that he was gone, and turning from the window, she sank down</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">upon the carpet in the collapse of deepest sorrow.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Gone! He was gone! His presence that had made all suffering tolerable</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">was withdrawn, and the place was empty—life itself was empty.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">He was gone—gone—not lovingly, after a lingering, tender</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">leave-taking—that would have been sorrowful enough; but it would have</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">been cheered by the promise of frequent interchange of letters, and the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">anticipation of re-union; how much more sorrowful this utter separation!</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Gone! gone! not in anger—that would have been bitter indeed; but it</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">would have been sweetened by hope that anger would subside, that</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">reflection would come, and reconciliation ensue; but how much bitterer</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">this hopeless disunion.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Gone in scorn! Gone in loathing! Gone to return no more but as a</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">stranger! Oh, insupportable grief! Oh, hopeless anguish! Oh, despair!</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">A few short weeks ago the heaven of her life had been so serene, so</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">divinely serene, and her soul had reflected back the beautiful “great</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">calm,” as a still lake the clear sky.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Now all was changed! Now all was clouds and storm and darkness! A</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">howling wilderness around! A howling tempest overhead! And her soul</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">answered back the tempestuous discord of life, as the storm-tossed</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">ocean, the storm-lowered sky! All was confusion, distraction, chaos!</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Wild impulses—suggestions of the fiend—darted meteor-like athwart her</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">mind:—to fly—to go away and leave a place, where she had been brought a</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">bride, full of love and hope and trust, and where every feeling of</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">womanly pride and delicacy had been ruthlessly, insultingly trampled in</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">the dust!</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">But simultaneously with this suggestion, arose the instinct of the wife,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">and the inspiration of the Christian, teaching her that scorned and</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">outraged as she had been, her only post of duty as of _hope_, was her</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">husband’s home. Yes, amid all the gloom and terror, she caught this one</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">glimpse of Heaven. Amid all the clash and clang of passion and despair,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">she heard this voice of God.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2"><span class="Apple-converted-space">                             </span>CHAPTER XXXIV.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2"><span class="Apple-converted-space">                          </span>CATHERINE’S REGENCY.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2"><span class="Apple-converted-space">                </span>But a trouble weighed upon her,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2"><span class="Apple-converted-space">                  </span>And perplexed her night and morn,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2"><span class="Apple-converted-space">                </span>With the burden of a station</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2"><span class="Apple-converted-space">                  </span>Unto which she was not born.—TENNYSON</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Slowly, very slowly Catherine recovered from the shock of that bitter</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">parting. And then she felt so lonely—so desolate; no mother—no sister—no</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">bosom friend, to give her one comforting look of sympathy, or one</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">sustaining word of affection. And she mourned afresh the loss of that</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">dear, sympathising, maternal friend, always so ready in her loving</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">wisdom, always so ready in any trial or affliction to give counsel and</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">comfort. And, oh! Catherine needed these—for, like the black, scudding</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">fragments of clouds left by the tempest, dark, despairing thoughts</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">drifted through her mind. Yes, she had need, and profoundly felt that</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">need, of counsel and comfort in this bewildering sorrow; but of whom</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">could she seek it? Of none—of none must she seek it. The true wife’s</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">instinct taught her that. For even when the retrospective image of his</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">dead mother, her own beloved bosom friend, recurred in the shape of a</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">once possible mediator between herself and husband, her mind intuitively</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">recoiled from the idea, and she knew that were that dear mother now</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">living, not even of her could she make a confidant—that the religious</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">unity, the integral sanctity, the cherished exclusiveness of marriage</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">would be invaded and broken, and the sweet charm lost by the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">introduction of a third party—beloved even as that dear, mutual</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">mother—into its sacred counsels. No, unhappy and bewildered as she was,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">she felt that by all her hopes of a future happy union, this wretched</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">division must be kept to herself—upon herself solely recoil the burden</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">and the pain—she “must tread the wine press alone.” And even when she</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">prayed for Divine inspiration to guide her, the response came from the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">depths of her spirit, “The Word of God is within you.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">And how empty the house seemed because one was away—how gloomy—how</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">funereal—even the light footstep of a chamber-maid in the distance</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">sounded hollowly,—sending a dreary echo through the many passages of the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">great, empty house—empty, for that he was gone.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">It seemed not worth while to go on with daily life at all—to keep up the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">fire on the household hearth, or to light the evening lamp, or to order</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">meals for herself alone.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">But if Catherine were for once tempted in her sorrow to forget her</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">duties,—her duties were not the least disposed to leave her long in</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">peace—no, not for an hour.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Catherine was roused from her fit of deep thought by the entrance of a</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">field woman, who, with the usual curtsey, and the customary greeting</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">of—“Sarvunt, ma’am,” stood before her.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Kate raised her heavy eyelids abstractedly.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Sarvunt, ma’am,” said the woman, again curtseying, “Aunt Field Mary is</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">well over it, ma’am. It’s a boy-chile, ma’am; a likely little boy-chile</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">as ever you see, ma’am. An’ Aunt Field Mary told me to tell you, ma’am,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">how, thank the Lord, an’ she’s fotch through safe, an’ how she wouldn’t</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">let dem sturve you las’ night, caze you wur so tired, an’ caze it wur</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">the lassest night Marse Archer had to stay home. An’ Aunt Field Mary</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">say, would you please to come down der to her quarter an’ see her dis</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">mornin’, and how she wants some green tea, an’ loaf sugar,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">an’—an’—_wine_, if you please, ma’am.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“What—what did you say?” asked Catherine, passing her hand over her</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">forehead, to dispel the concentration of sorrowful thought.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Aunt Field Mary, ma’am, it’s a boy-chile, ma’am, a likely little</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">boy-chile as ever you see, ma’am, an’ she’s fotch well through of it,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">thank Marster, ma’am, an’ she say, how will you come an’ see her, an’</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">send her some liquor, an’ things. Likewise, Uncle Jubilee, its daddy,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">ma’am, he say, can’t he have a holyday to-day, ma’am, an’ stay home</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">out’n de field, seein’ how it’s his firstest son an’ hier out’n seven</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">darters.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Passing her hand across her forehead slowly, Catherine dispersed the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">last lingering fragments of her bitter reverie, and stood up to her</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">simple, practical, household duties. And then her action was clear and</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">decided. She took up her little basket of keys, bade the woman follow</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">her, and went down stairs and into the pantry, where she filled a hamper</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">with tea and sugar, crackers, jelly, and other little matters, and gave</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">it to her attendant, saying—</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Take these to Field Mary, and say that I will be down to see her</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">presently.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Yes, ma’am, sure ’nough. But ’bout de liquor, honey? likewise Uncle</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Jubilee’s holyday, seein’ how it’s his firstest son an’ hier out’n seven</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">darters?”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Tell Mary that I cannot send her wine, it is not good for her now; but</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">tell her to mention any other want, and if it be a proper one, it shall</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">be supplied. Tell Jubilee to return to the field—his labor cannot</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">possibly be spared from it to-day. And stay—what is your name?”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Nelly, ma’am. ’Deed it is, honey. That’s my name, Nelly.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“I think I never saw you up at the house before, Nelly?”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“No, ma’am, likely not, chile, indeed. I lives quite distant off, down</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">der on Cedar Creek, unnerneaf of Bushy Hill der on de outskeerts o’ de</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">plantashum.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Well, Nelly, who is tending Field Mary?”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“_I_ is, ma’am. Hardbargain Henny, she long o’ her now. But _I_ tends</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">her. I tends all de wimmin hands when dey’s sick, ’deed I does, chile.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">But poor creeturs, dey alluz wants der miste’ss, _alluz_. I never knew</span></p>

<p class="p3"><span class="s2">you sturved, arter keepin’ on arter us all night to send for you; but I</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">telled her good I wan’t agoin’ to have the young madam wurritted long o’</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">her ‘fernal nonsense, bein’ as it was de lassest night Marster had to</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">stay at home.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Yes, there, go now,” said Catherine, waving her hand wearily.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Nyther wan’t it any sort o’ use, case I, myse’f, dough I should’n be de</span></p>

<p class="p3"><span class="s2">more credit and money for makin’ you well.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“There—there—there—there, Nelly, return to your patient.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Yes, mist’ess, I’m gwine now, ma’am, only I wanted to tell you while I</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">trought of it, how when eber you ’quire of de aid an’ comfort, you no</span></p>

<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Nelly, there is one thing that I must say to you now, and which I wish</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">you to remember. It is that when I give a direction I intend it to be</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">followed.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">The old woman looked mortified, and took up the hamper, settled it upon</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">her head, and went out. It pained Catherine’s gentle heart to speak so</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">peremptorily. But this was one among the abuses she felt it to be her</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">imperative duty to reform, the habits of idleness and listlessness, and</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">the propensity to stand and gossip among the domestics. Trifling as this</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">little incident was, it served to arouse Catherine and place her on her</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">feet, and she did not utterly sink again.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">The evening fire was kindled on the household hearth, and the evening</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">lamp lighted, though there was but one lonely woman to feel their</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">cheering influence.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">The next day was the Sabbath, and Catherine as usual attended church.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">She felt deeply the need of religious consolation. Her spirit hungered,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">thirsted, failed and fainted for the feeding, refreshing, strengthening</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">ministrations of the gospel. The old, sad, unanswered problem of</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">unmerited suffering perplexed her. She felt herself sinking into that</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">sad and nearly hopeless state of mind, induced by great and singular</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">trials to be borne perforce alone and in secret—when, wanting human</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">sympathy and failing of divine comfort, the soul loses sight of the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Merciful Father in the Omnipotent Creator, or in other words, of</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">especial Providence in general Providence, and falls sadly, despairingly</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">back upon its helpless self, and says that the Supreme Ruler of the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Universe, the Governor of countless millions of suns and systems, never</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">stoops to care for a poor, lost atom like itself. She needed to hear the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">gospel message of love and hope again. But when she entered her pew, and</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">raised her eyes to the pulpit, she was disappointed in missing from his</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">place the mild and venerable face and form of the parish clergyman,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">whose teachings every Sabbath morning sent her home with renewed love,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">and sustained her through the week, and she was pained to see in his</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">stead a young man, a mere youth in seeming, some student newly ordained,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">she supposed, and she sank back in her seat, saddened with the thought</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">that she would not get the greatly needed spiritual help from him; for</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">what could a student in his youth know of life’s dread trials? of the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">heart’s mournful experiences, or the spirit’s deep needs? She felt sure</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">he could not help her, and she sank back, resigning herself with a deep</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">sigh. The opening hymn was given out—</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2"><span class="Apple-converted-space">                 </span>God moves in a mysterious way</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2"><span class="Apple-converted-space">                   </span>His wonders to perform,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2"><span class="Apple-converted-space">                 </span>He plants His footsteps on the sea.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2"><span class="Apple-converted-space">                   </span>And rides upon the storm.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2"><span class="Apple-converted-space">                 </span>Ye fearful souls, fresh courage take,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2"><span class="Apple-converted-space">                   </span>The cloud ye so much dread</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2"><span class="Apple-converted-space">                 </span>Is big with mercy, and shall break</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2"><span class="Apple-converted-space">                   </span>In blessings on your head.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">The first words of this hymn fell upon Catherine’s surprised ear,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">filling her soul with awe—for it seemed a direct answer to her thought.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">And all that hymn, every stanza, every line, was filled with meaning for</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">her, and powerful in its effect upon her mind, in its peculiar state of</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">experience. She listened in penitent, grateful, reverent silence,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">folding her hands meekly, and saying within her heart—</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Father, forgive my doubts and fears! I will believe it! Yes, I will</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">believe that even this heavy cloud is laden with mercy, and will shower</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">blessings! I will believe that even this bitter trial—this bitter,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">bitter separation and disunion, is in some way necessary to our moral</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">growth and future welfare, and that I shall see it! I _do_ believe it,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">for I have had blessed answers before to doubts. ‘And we know that all</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">things work together for good to them that love the Lord.’ I do believe</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">it.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2"><span class="Apple-converted-space">                      </span>God is His own interpreter,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2"><span class="Apple-converted-space">                        </span>And He will make it plain,</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">were the solemn last words of the Divine Song that awed her into</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">stillness. This hymn was sung, Catherine’s beautiful voice joining the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">choir. And when it was ended, followed the prayer, so singularly</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">coincident, that every word gave voice to the deep silent cry in her own</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">suffering heart.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">And then the young minister arose to give out the text: Matthew x. 29.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Are not two sparrows sold for a farthing? And one of them shall not</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">fall on the ground without your Father.” And here followed the sermon.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">The manner of the young preacher was modest, natural, calm and sweet, as</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">befitted the gentle words of the text, and the consoling subject of the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">sermon—FAITH IN PROVIDENCE—the child-like faith that comes through the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">heart, and not through the head. Catherine had thought he could not help</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">her. Never had she been more in error in her life. That pale young</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">preacher had a divine message for her—for _her_; an answer to her</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">unsolvable problem; a message, providentially, the most direct, pointed,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">strong, startling that ever fell from lips touched with fire,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">revivifying the soul of the receiver; a message that satisfied every</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">doubt, and calmed every fear, and replied to every question as</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">perfectly, as satisfyingly, as if Heaven had spoken; a message that</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">aroused faith, revived hope, rekindled love, till all the soul glowed</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">with divine fire. She was wrapped, entranced, carried away by the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">eloquence, power and pathos of this divinely-inspired discourse. She</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">never saw the young preacher before or after, but he had dropped a</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">celestial treasure deep into where she kept it safe—a talisman through</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">all the trials of life.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">She left the church loving, hopeful, strong in faith, strong to act and</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">endure, patient to wait. So elevated and inspired was her soul, that it</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">illumined her whole countenance. And when the county ladies crowded</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">around her at the church door to condole with her on the departure of</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Major Clifton, and to press hospitalities upon her, and to urge her not</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">to mope in widowhood at home, their benevolent purposes were forgotten</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">in their surprise, and the first words were—</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Why, how brightly you look this morning, Mrs. Clifton!”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Catherine promised many visits, and extended many invitations, and</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">finally was glad to escape and enter her carriage, to dwell in lonely,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">loving reverence upon the words she had heard. And she reached home. And</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">the Word departed not from her, neither that day, nor the next, nor</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">through life. And with the perfect faith in God, perfect trust in her</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">future came. And again she whispered to herself the charming thoughts—</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“I will wait patiently—I will work faithfully. The post of duty, as of</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">hope, is my husband’s house and home. He trusts me, at least, even now,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">with the charge of this great plantation. Construe it as he may, it is a</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">mark of great confidence. I will be true to the trust.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">And then, indeed, as she whispered these words to her heart, hope, sweet</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">hope, inspired her more and more, and strengthened her more and more,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">and she felt that he still loved her—she felt it by that sure instinct</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">that teaches a woman when she is beloved, though no word, look, or</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">gesture reveals it to her. And she acted upon this feeling, although</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">almost unconscious of its existence as a _motive_. And she knew that she</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">would be useful to him, substantially useful to him where she was—for</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">with her it was not enough to be devoted, soul and body, to his</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">interests,—no, “wishing well” _must_ have a “body in it,” in order “to</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">be felt.” She communed with her heart, asking—</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“What, besides the service of God, do I really live for in this world?</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">For his happiness. Yes, my profound heart, that is it! For his good, his</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">interests, his welfare. I have not been an obstacle to his happiness. I</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">have not been a stumbling block in the way of his marrying another. No!</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">for I feel that he loves me as he never loved another; and I love him as</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">he was never loved by another; and has any other the instinct, the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">inspiration, the strength and patience to bear with him, that God has</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">placed in my heart? I will believe and trust in the Lord and His</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">inspirations. And heart, and brain, and hands,—all that I am, and all</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">that I have, will I devote to his service. And until he restores me,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">that alone shall make my occupation and my happiness.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">The next morning being Monday, she arose with the intention of taking</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">seriously in hand the business of the estate. This was now the first of</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">December, and there was a great deal to be done before the close of the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">year, in financial, as well as in domestic and agricultural matters. The</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">overseer and the hired farm-laborers had all been paid in advance, up to</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">the first of January. And Major Clifton had left Catherine twelve</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">hundred dollars in cash, for her own current expenses. All this money</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">she had at once determined to devote to another purpose—namely—to</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">lifting some of those notes which would fall due on the first of the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">year. She determined, also, in order to help to clear off the incubus of</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">debt for the coming year, to try to find a tenant for Hardbargain, and</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">to devote the rent to the taking up of the remaining notes. She went</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">into a patient and thorough examination of the overseer’s accounts, and</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">discovered, with much pain, that he had embezzled the funds trusted to</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">him for the payment of the hired hands; and a stricter review of his</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">conduct, resulted in the detection of other malpractices, that decided</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Catherine to give him warning. A very little observation convinced her,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">also, that the “baker’s dozen of hired laborers, all his own kin folks,”</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">were an unnecessary and expensive set of idle parasites, of whom she</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">determined to rid the plantation at the end of the year. She finally</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">concluded still further to lower the scale of expenditures, by parting</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">with her housekeeper. She reconciled herself to this last step, when she</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">heard of a place in the neighborhood to which Mrs. Mercer might go. Yet</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Catherine did not wish to make these important changes without again</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">consulting Major Clifton. And, perhaps—let the whole truth be</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">told—perhaps poor Kate was desirous to hear from him, and glad of a fair</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">business excuse to write. And she wrote the following note. She had some</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">trouble with it. It was the first (except the lines at the funeral,) she</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">had ever written him, and, under all the circumstances, she hesitated</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">how to begin, or how to end it. She disliked to address him as a mere</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">acquaintance, and she shrunk from any warmer manner of greeting.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Finally, she wrote, as she would have written to a friend—thus—</span></p>

<p class="p3"><span class="s2"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“DEAR MAJOR CLIFTON:—</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“After a very careful investigation of the affairs of the plantation,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>and much patient thought concerning them, I have concluded—if I have</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>your approbation and authority for doing so—that the establishment can</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>be cut down so as to reduce the annual expenditure to about one-half</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>its present amount—also, that the Hardbargain farm can be let for a</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>sum, double the annual amount of what we can save at White Cliffs.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>And, finally, that the aggregate of these moneys, saved and acquired,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>will be sufficient, in two years, to pay off the accumulated debts</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>oppressing the estate. (Here followed a more detailed account of her</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>plans.) Please write, and let me know if I have your authority for</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>proceeding.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2"><span class="Apple-converted-space">                                            </span>Yours, faithfully,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2"><span class="Apple-converted-space">                                                            </span>“CATHERINE.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">In due time, Catherine received the answer. She seized it with an eager</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">hand. She opened it with trembling fingers. She most unreasonably</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">hoped—poor girl—for some kind, relenting word—some token of approbation</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">or affection. Truly, she believed in miracles. This was the precious</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">epistle—</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2"><span class="Apple-converted-space">                                          </span>“HAMPTON, December 16th, 1812.</span></p>

<p class="p3"><span class="s2"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“MADAM:—</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Your favor of the 8th instant lies before me. I beg leave to</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>reiterate now what I said at parting—viz: that I have not the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>slightest hesitation in leaving the plantation to your own exclusive</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>charge and direction—having no doubt that self-interest will guide</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>your talent into the surest means of recruiting the resources of the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>estate. Let Hardbargain, by all means, if it pleases you to do it,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>remembering that I have nothing to do with that cunningly acquired</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>little piece of property of yours. Regarding the dismissal of the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>housekeeper, the overseer, and the hired farm-laborers, whom you</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>consider as supernumeraries, send them off, by all means, if you think</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>it proper to do so. I, myself, perhaps, should have hesitated, ere I</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>sent them adrift upon the world. But money-saving is, I presume, a</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>plebeian instinct.</span></p>

<p class="p3"><span class="s2"><span class="Apple-converted-space">                         </span>CATHERINE’S PROGRESS.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2"><span class="Apple-converted-space">               </span>And she grew a noble lady,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2"><span class="Apple-converted-space">                 </span>And her people loved her much.—TENNYSON.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Catherine’s arrangements for the year were all completed by the first of</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">January; and with less inconvenience to others, and consequently with</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">less pain to herself, than she had dared to anticipate.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">She heard that Turnbull, the cashiered overseer, had purchased a piece</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">of land in the valley—(doubtless with the embezzled funds, but of that</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">she did not think)—built upon it a log cabin, and set up as a farmer</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">upon his own footing; and that he had taken his tribe of sons and</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">nephews to assist him. She was very much pleased to know that they were</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">out of the way of swindling others as they had swindled Clifton, and</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">also that they were equally removed from want and suffering.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Mrs. Mercer, by her warm recommendation, had found a very eligible</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">situation as housekeeper to an elderly, single gentleman—a planter in</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">the neighborhood—and her benevolence was set at rest in regard to the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">old woman.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Lastly, she had let Hardbargain to excellent tenants—a young New</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Englander and his wife—who took it ready furnished and stocked as it</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">was; and designed to work the land and keep a school.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">The negroes had their usual carnival at Christmas, lasting till after</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">New Year—during which, all that had been engaged in the last twelve</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">months were married, and wedding parties were given and dances got up,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">etc., etc.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">But on the second of January, Catherine caused them all to be assembled</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">in her presence, and told them that she should, on the next Monday and</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">thereafter, set them to work in earnest; that their overseer was</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">gone—(“Thank Marster Lord for that,” exclaimed several)—but that she</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">herself would be their overseer for the ensuing year. (“You’ll be fair,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">young mistress! We ain’t afeard o’ you,” said the same.) She waved her</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">hand for silence and attention, and then informed them farther—that</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">though they should find her hereafter as heretofore, just and moderate</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">and merciful; ready to give ear to their complaints, and settle their</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">difficulties, and reward their zeal—yet that she should certainly</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">require a more steady and systematic application to their duties than</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">they had ever before given. She said, in conclusion, that their health,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">comfort, improvement and happiness, should be her care; but that even in</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">this also, she should need their co-operation—(“You shall hab it,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">mist’ess, ’deed you shall, honey;” from some of the older negroes.)</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Finally she dismissed them, telling them that she wished to see them all</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">together again on Sunday evening at early candle-light, in the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">spinning-room, where she desired that they should assemble quietly.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">On Saturday evening when the women were done spinning, Catherine</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">directed that all the wheels should be taken to one corner of the room,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">and crowded together, and that the settees and benches from the piazza</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">and lawns, should be brought in and arranged around the walls; and</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">finally that a little reading stand and chair should be brought for her</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">own use. These preparations occupied but ten minutes, and the room was</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">fitted up for family worship.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">On Sunday evening, at the appointed hour, Catherine met her assembled</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">laborers and servants there. When they were all seated and perfectly</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">still and attentive, she said to them—“I desired your presence here this</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Sabbath evening, that I might make a proposition to you. I have been</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">thinking that we ought not to finish every day without remembering and</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">returning thanks to our Heavenly Father for His daily bounties,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">protection and mercies to us, and asking a continuance of the same</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">blessings; and I think we should not dare to lie down and commit</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">ourselves to that helpless sleep that so resembles death, without</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">confessing to our Lord the sins we have committed against Him during the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">day, imploring His forgiveness of them, and asking His watchful care</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">over us during the darkness of the night and the defencelessness of</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">sleep. Don’t you think so?”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Yes, yes, mist’ess, we do, we do indeed,” answered several of the elder</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">negroes, clearly—while a modest murmur of assent ran through the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">assembly. The negroes are strongly inclined to worship, and ever ready</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">to co-operate in anything of that sacred character.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Catherine resumed—</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“We should each do this in private by our own bedsides, but we should</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">also do it together as a household—as the creatures of one God, the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">children of one Father.” She paused a moment in thought, and then spoke</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">again. “I have been also reflecting that you ought all to know more of</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">the Bible than you have as yet had any opportunity of knowing. And I</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">think that most of you would be pleased to know more.” She paused for an</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">answer.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Yes, yes, mist’ess, we do,” chimed in many eager voices, old and young.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“I know you do. Well, then, henceforth we will assemble in this room</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">every evening just before bed time, and as a household of the Lord, a</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">family of one Father, spend a short time together in reading and hearing</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">the Holy Scriptures, and in prayer. In beginning to read the Bible with</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">you, I shall commence with the first chapter of the New Testament, and</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">read a chapter every night, until we regularly read it through. And</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">afterwards, in the same manner, we will go through David’s Psalms and</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">the Prophets.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Catherine finished and sat down, made a sign for silence, and opened the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">New Testament and commenced her reading. Never had reader a more</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">attentive or interested audience. She passed over the long, hard</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">genealogical table in the first part of the chapter, and began with the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Angel’s visit to the Virgin Mary, and read also the second chapter,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">describing the birth and infancy of the Saviour, sometimes stopping to</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">give explanations, which she knew the simplicity of her audience made</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">necessary. The family service was concluded with a prayer, and the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">servants dismissed.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">And this evening service became thenceforth a daily practice. And</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Catherine’s people learned more of the life and doctrines of the Saviour</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">from her, than they would have acquired in a lifetime’s attendance upon</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">learned ministers, who preach only for the educated.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">On Monday morning, Catherine entered upon her assumed duty of overseer.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">And, never were the affairs of a plantation better administered than by</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">her. Her “good will was to it,” and all her faculties brought to bear</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">upon the business. And although she kept a firm hold upon the reins of</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">government, exacted the complete fulfillment of every duty, and kept</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">steadily at their post every man and woman, yet never was a mistress</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">more beloved and venerated. And certainly never was one so faithfully</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">served. All subordinates need—not harsh nor lax government—but a steady,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">systematic, rational government, which they can understand and be</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">satisfied with, and such an one was that of Catherine. Her</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">administration was for her people a very wholesome change from the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">capricious tyranny of the late overseer, who had been accustomed to</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">permit the utmost license and laxity among the laborers for four or five</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">days, and then, growing alarmed, to hurry and worry, and drive and</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">maltreat them for a week, to make up for lost time. Catherine’s</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">government was regular, firm, just and merciful. And she was loved,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">respected and served accordingly. There were some exceptions, but they</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">were very few and unimportant, and soon fell under the general rule.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">And thus, in the perfect performance of every duty, domestic and social,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">that devolved upon her as wife, friend, mistress and Christian,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Catherine passed the winter. The spring brought the usual accession of</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">busy work, and she gave herself up to its direction with untiring energy</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">and activity. She prayed, and labored, and trusted in Heaven, and Heaven</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">prospered her work, and all went well. Before the first of June, she had</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">paid off all those heavy notes, which had been accumulating interest so</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">long. There were other heavy debts, but she saw her way clearly through,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">discharging them before the end of the current year.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">But she never, never heard from Major Clifton. He seemed just as lost to</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">her as if the grave had received him. She took all the principal</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">newspapers, for the sake of keeping the run of the campaign; and oh!</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">often her cheeks and very lips paled, and her heart sickened and sunk</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">with terror, to read of the awful perils of war, and to think that he</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">was exposed to them. But terror was not the only emotion raised by these</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">descriptions of engagements. No—her whole soul glowed with patriotic</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">ardor, when she read of the gallant repulse of the combined land and</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">naval forces of the British, under Admirals Warren and Cockburn, and</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">General Sir Sydney Beckwith, from Craney Island, by a mere handful of</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">our troops; and her heart swelled with love and enthusiasm, when in the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">same account, she saw her husband’s name mentioned with the highest</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">encomiums upon his bravery, discretion, and invaluable services.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Autumn came, bringing along with its other associations intensely</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">distinct images of the last sweet, calm days she had passed at</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Hardbargain with her dying mother, and these vivid recollections</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">stimulated afresh her devotion and her energy. During her</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">administration, to clear the estate of debt, and at its close, to</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">restore it unincumbered into the hands of her husband, was now her dear</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">object. When the harvest was gathered in, she consulted several of her</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">most intelligent and enterprising neighbors, concerning the state of the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">agricultural markets, and afterwards proceeded to Baltimore in person in</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">order to obtain the best possible prices for her crops. She succeeded in</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">effecting highly advantageous sales, and with the proceeds she returned</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">home and paid off several of those heavy debts.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">And so the autumn passed, and winter came, with its leisure, its stormy</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">days, and its long nights. Nothing occurred to break the monotony of</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">daily life until the last of December, when she collected the half</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">year’s rent from Hardbargain, and paid off all the remaining debts,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">except one inconsiderable note of six hundred dollars. On the morning of</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">the first of January, she sent as usual to the village post-office for</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">her papers. When the boy returned, he handed her a letter directed in</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">the hand-writing of Major Clifton. Oh! joy at last!—she tore open the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">envelope, and seized the enclosure—it was nothing but a check upon the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Bank of Richmond for five hundred dollars. She let it fall unheeded,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">covered her face with her hands, and wept silently. But when her fit of</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">silent weeping was over, she arose, took the check, went and collected</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">what money she had left in the house, and ordered her carriage and drove</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">to L——, and lifted that last note. Then Catherine had the joy of seeing</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">the property entirely free from debt.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">And so passed the winter and came the spring of 1814. And still she</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">heard nothing from Major Clifton. And since reading the account of his</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">gallant conduct on Craney Island, she learned nothing of him. And still</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">from her loop-hole of retreat, she anxiously watched the progress of the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">war, seizing upon all the published accounts, and reading them with the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">greatest avidity. How diligently she searched the papers to find his</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">name, and how eagerly her eyes darted down upon any officer’s name</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">beginning with a C, which always turned out to be Crutchfield, Corbin,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Carey, anything but Clifton! Oh, how barren was all this war news, after</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">all!</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">But Admiral Cockburn’s piratical fleet was now in the Chesapeake,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">spreading devastation and terror through all its islands, coasts, and</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">tributary rivers; and every paper was filled with accounts of his</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">marauding incursions and savage atrocities, that defied just</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">description, much more exaggeration. Hear what a cotemporary historian</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">says of him:</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Throughout the waters and shores of the Chesapeake, Admiral Cockburn</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">now reigned supreme, ubiquitous and irresistible. The burglaries,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">larcenies, incendiarisms, and mere marauding, perpetrated by Admiral</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Cockburn, were as odious and ignoble, though less bloody and horrible,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">than the inhuman atrocities of the British savages in the West. Slaves</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">in large numbers, large quantities of tobacco, furniture, and other</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">private property, protected by the laws of war, and seldom taken, even</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">if destroyed by land troops, were seized upon by the sea-faring warriors</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">with piratical rapacity. The predatory attacks of the enemy in the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Chesapeake were limited to isolated villages, poor farm-houses, and</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">other indefensible objects taken or destroyed. Destruction was the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">punishment proclaimed and executed for resistance. The house and barn</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">were burned of whoever fired a shot, or drew a sword in self-defence.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Many respectable persons in comfortable circumstances were reduced to</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">poverty by these depredations. The poor were especial sufferers. With</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">shores so indented with creeks and bays, the whole force of a State</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">under arms would have been unequal to cope with such overwhelming</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">aggressors.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Reading frequently such accounts as this, and even more alarming ones</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">than this, is it strange that Catherine sickened with terror and anxiety</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">for the safety of him who was exposed to all the horrors of this</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">unsparing warfare.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">At length the shock came. It was on the evening of the day after</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">harvest-home, and she had given all her people a holyday, even down to</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">the messenger whose daily duty it was to bring her papers from the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">post-office, telling him that he might take the whole day, and bring her</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">the mail when he returned home at night. Thus, instead of receiving her</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">papers, as usual, in the morning, Catherine had to wait until the boy’s</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">return in the evening. She was sitting in the spinning-room, awaiting</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">the assembling of her servants, whom she had just summoned to evening</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">worship, when they all entered, and with them the post-boy, who came up</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">and laid before her the single paper that had come that day. She took</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">it, to lay aside until after the evening’s devotions were over—but a</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">magic name on the outside arrested her attention. She caught up the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">paper, and read in large capitals:</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“ENGAGEMENT AT ST. LEONARD’S. _British forces under Admiral Cockburn</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>repulsed with considerable loss. Major Clifton dangerously wounded._”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">She read no farther—the room swam around her—she reeled, and fell into</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">the arms of Henny, who sprang forward to receive her. Her people crowded</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">around her, in great anxiety. But only one moment she fainted thus—then</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">she recovered, controlled herself, resumed her seat, and after sending</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">the servants all back to their places, by a wave of her hand, opened the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Bible, and commenced the evening’s exercises. Her face was very pale,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">her hands quivered in turning the leaves, and her voice faltered, so as</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">to be nearly inaudible, but she persevered, and got through with the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">service, even unto the benediction. After it was all over, she detained</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">them a moment, by a gesture, and then said—</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Your master has been dangerously wounded.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Murmurs of surprise, grief and anxiety agitated the assembly, and</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">testified to their affectionate concern.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Go now quietly to your homes, and to-morrow perhaps I may be able to</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">tell you more.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">They dispersed slowly, turning glances of uneasiness and distress at the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">silent anguish of her countenance.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">She too, went out. How she spent the night is best known to Heaven. In</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">the morning when she appeared among her household—the wasted cheeks, the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">sunken eyes, the hollow temples, and the written agony of the brow,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">alone proved the consuming sorrow of her heart.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Jack—I want Jack,” she said, as soon as she reached her parlor. And the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">favorite servant appeared before her. “Jack, I think you love me,” she</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">said.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Try me, mist’ess dear, an’ see ef I doesn’t.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“And I think you love your master?”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Ah! my Lor’! Try me—jes on’y try me, mist’ess—dat’s all.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“I wish you to go to him from me.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Oh! do—do—do—_do_ sen’ me, mist’ess! It’s war I longs for to be.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“I shall. The distance is over a hundred miles. You must pick the best</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">horse in the stable, and start within an hour, and ride day and night</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">until you reach your destination.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“’Deed, mist’ess, I won’t let de grass grow onnerneaf of my feet.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Very well, then, go now—have you had your breakfast?”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Yes, ma’am.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Go now, then, and prepare for your journey, while I write you a pass.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">And when you are quite ready, come to me, and I will give you farther</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">directions about your journey.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Jack hastened out—and his mistress remained for a few minutes, with her</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">hands pressed to her heart, repeating to herself, with agonizing</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">earnestness—</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Would—oh!—would to Heaven, I too, might go.” Soon she started, as with</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">sudden recollection, and hurried off to write the pass, and the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">directions about the road. And when in less than half an hour Jack</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">appeared before her again, she was ready for him. “Here,” she said, “is</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">your pass, and written directions, lest you should forget what I tell</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">you.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Nebber fear me forgettin’, mist’ess, dear.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“You must take the road to Alexandria, which is seventy miles from here.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">When you reach that town, take the ferry-boat and cross the Potomac to</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">the Maryland side. Then inquire your road to the village of Benedict, on</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">the Patuxent, which is thirty or forty miles further down the country.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">When you reach the village, ask the way to St. Leonard’s. Arrived at</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">your journey’s end, find Colonel Wadsworth, or Major Stuart, or Captain</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Miller, show your pass and tell your errand, and they will direct you</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">where to find your master. Do you understand?”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Yes, mist’ess.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“All this that I have told you is written down here on this piece of</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">parchment; take care of it, lest you should forget, and lose your way.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Yes, ma’am, I’ll be berry cautiencious.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“And now listen to me, Jack;” her voice broke down, some emotion seemed</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">struggling in her bosom for expression—she quelled it and went on—“When</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">you find your master, write to me at once; thank Heaven I taught you to</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">write! write then to me at once, and tell me how he is. Will you promise</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">me that?”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Faithful, mist’ess—faithful.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“And, Jack, when you have once found him, _be faithful unto death_ to</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">him. Never leave him. Nurse him, wait on him, watch over him day and</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">night—_do so_, if you love him, Jack;” again the inward struggle choked</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">her voice, and when she resumed, it was with broken and faltering</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">accents, “and, Jack, attend—take this note—and _when his fever is</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">off_—mind you, _when he is calm_—give it to him.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Yes, mist’ess, dear.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“That is all I have to say to you. Now hasten. Good-bye; and may Heaven</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">bless and speed you.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>

<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Nearly a fortnight of extreme anxiety passed away, during which</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Catherine heard nothing from her messenger. On the evening of the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">thirteenth day of his departure, however, a letter was brought to her,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">directed in the well-known, but alas! not very familiar hand-writing of</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Major Clifton. Oh, joy! He was living then, and even well enough to</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">write. With a fervent ejaculation of deep gratitude to Heaven, she broke</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">the seal. But her face paled as she read—</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2"><span class="Apple-converted-space">                                    </span>“ON BOARD THE BRITISH SHIP ALBION, }</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2"><span class="Apple-converted-space">                                                  </span>“August 21st, 1814.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>}</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“CATHERINE:—</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Are you then destined to be forever fatal, not only to me, but to</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>every human creature that is faithful to me? See what your reckless</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>disregard of others’ lives has done!—doomed a poor, fond, faithful</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>creature to a felon’s death! Attend, woman! to what I am about to</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>write. I was not dangerously wounded, as the newspapers reported, but</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>slightly hurt, and taken prisoner, and conveyed on board this, the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Admiral’s ship—as they did not report. Thus, the poor fellow, whom you</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>sent on this death’s errand, not finding me in the American camp, and</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>hearing that I was a prisoner on board the British fleet, true to your</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>command, to find and communicate with me, and reckless of his own</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>danger, procured a boat at Benedict, and came out alongside this ship.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>You know the result, as well as I can inform you. The wretched boy was</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>taken and put in irons as a spy, and has been doomed to be hanged at</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>the yard-arm. He only waits the Admiral’s orders for execution. My own</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>inconvenience is nothing beside his cruel fate—yet, nevertheless, I</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>may as well inform you that I, who was upon parole, when your</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>messenger sought to communicate with me, have also to thank your</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>interference for being put under arrest, and nothing but the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>relaxation of strict discipline, incident upon the departure of the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>two commanders, and a mere fortuity, affords me the opportunity of</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>writing, and sending this note. Admiral Cockburn and General Ross are</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>now on their march to Washington City. And my object in writing to you</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>is merely this: to assure you, by all my hopes of salvation, that</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>unless you, in your unequaled machiavelism, find some way of saving</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>this boy from death, I will never see, or speak to you again.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>

<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Still clasping the letter, her hand and head fell with a gesture of</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">utter despair.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Why, what’s de matter, Miss Kate, honey? no bad news, I trus’,” said</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Henny.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">A deep, heart-breaking sob only answered her.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“My goodness, Miss Kate, deary, what is it den? is marster dead? Oh,</span></p>

<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">A gasp from Catherine, and a gesture imploring silence, while she</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">spanned her temples with both hands, and tried to think clearly.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“My gracious, Miss Kate, don’t look so ghashly, honey—don’t. _Is_</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">marster dead, sure enough?”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“He’s not dead, he’s not dead,” said Catherine, huskily, while she waved</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">her hand for peace.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Well, den, honey, long as der’s life der’s hope, an’ no ’casion for</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">’spair. Is he berry bad, honey?”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“He’s well—well,” said Catherine, in the same tone.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Well, den, long as he’s well, what ’casion you take on so, honey——Oh!</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">my Lor’—taint—taint poor brother Jack as anything’s happened to?”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Oh, Henny! Your master and Jack have both been taken prisoners by</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Admiral Cockburn!”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Oh, Miss Kate! Oh, my Lor’, Miss Kate! An’ dey do tell me how he eats</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">his prisoners ’live,” exclaimed Henny, falling down into a chair,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">flinging her check apron over her head, and beginning to cry.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Almost heedless of her handmaid’s violent demonstrations of grief and</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">terror, Catherine walked up and down the floor, with her hands clasped</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">around her temples, in the very agony of thought. To save the boy from</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">death—_how_ was she, at that remote distance, to save him? Oh! it seemed</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">a mockery, a snare, to put forgiveness upon such an impracticable</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">condition! Yet she thought him no setter of snares. She thought over the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">whole of the letter, searching for a _hint_; she needed not to look at</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">it again—every line and word was burned in upon her brain and heart—she</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">thought over the whole of it, earnestly searching for a clue to</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">action—she found it at length in the phrases, “He only waits the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Admiral’s order for execution,” and “Admiral Cockburn and General Ross</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">are now on their march to Washington City.” She thought if she could see</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">the Admiral, she might yet save his life—of so little worth as a</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">sacrifice to the enemy, but of such inestimable value to her. The date</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">of the letter was the twenty-first—this day was the twenty-third. “Oh!</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">he is probably executed by this time,” said Despondency. “But possibly</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">not,” said Hope. She tried to think clearly, to separate the dreadful</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">chaos of thought and passion, and to weigh and adjust circumstances, so</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">as she might decide and act promptly. Admiral Cockburn and General Ross</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">must be near Washington, if they had not already reached the city.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Washington was two full day’s journey from her home, but every hour was</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">precious, for life and death might hang upon it. She could perform the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">journey in a day and night. Her resolution was taken. Going up to where</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Henny sat crying, and rocking herself backward and forward, she said—</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Rise, Henny, and go and tell James to saddle my horse, _my rough coated</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">pony_, Henny, he is the strongest and the fleetest, and bring him around</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">to the door.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Oh, Miss Kate! does you think he’ll eat ’em sure ’nough?”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“What do you mean, Henny—are you crazy?”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Admirable Cockbu’n, honey. Does you think he’ll eat Marse Archy an’</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">brother Jack, sure ’nough? I hopes not, ’cause you see, chile, brother</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Jack, he’s so poor an’ lean, an’ Marse Archer, he mus’ be tough an’</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">stringy ’nough, too long o’ all dis yer warfarin’, but Lor’, ’haps he’ll</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">think der good ’nough for sojers rations, and give ’em to dem.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Henny that is all a notion.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“’Bout der eaten ’em, honey?”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Yes, yes—_don’t_ stop me now, Henny! hasten! hasten! quick! quick,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Henny! Have my pony caught, and then hurry back to me.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“But, Miss Kate, are you sure?”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Yes, yes, I’m sure. Oh! hurry, hurry!”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">The woman went out, and Catherine sat down and penned a hasty note to</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">her neighbor, the down-east tenant of Hardbargain, requesting him to</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">give a slight supervision of affairs at White Cliffs during her absence</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">for a few days. By the time she had sealed and directed it, Henny</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">re-appeared.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Go fetch my riding-dress, Henny,” was her next prompt command.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“My goodness, Miss Kate, where—”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Go, Henny, at once, and don’t stay to question me.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">The maid obeyed, and her mistress rang the bell, and gave the note she</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">had written to a boy, to carry to Hardbargain.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">As he left the room, Henny entered it with the riding habit.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Help me on with it at once, Henny,” said Catherine, meeting her.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“My goodness, Miss Kate! you to be goin’ out this time o’ night, an’</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">we-dem in so much trouble. You didn’ ax me to tell nobody who wur to</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">wait on you; but Jeemes, he’s gettin’ ready.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“No, no, I don’t want anybody.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Dear me, mist’ess, honey, where’s you gwine?”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Didn’t I tell you? To Washington City.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“To Washington?” exclaimed Henny, letting the dress fall from her hands,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">and looking up in stupor.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Yes, yes, didn’t I tell you—to Washington, to see Admiral Cockburn, and</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">save your brother. I do not believe of Cockburn—I never believe of any</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">one—as ill as is reported of them, and I think if I go and make a proper</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">representation to him, I shall be able to save Jack.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Henny stood gazing at her mistress in the same stupor.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Come, come, Henny! give me the other sleeve around here,” said</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Catherine, impatiently.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Still Henny stood and stared in a stupor, until suddenly all her muscles</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">and limbs gave way, and she sank down before her mistress, embraced her</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">knees, looked up into her face, and said, in tones of earnest, deep</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">affection—</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“_Don’t_ go, mist’ess, _don’t_ go—don’t trust yerse’f long o’ Admirable</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Cockburn an’ his hang-gallows sojers. _Don’t._”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“I must, Henny.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“_Oh! no, no._ Memorize what happened at Raison River, an’ at Ham’ton,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">how dey nyder spared sexes nor ages—nyder ole paralytic men nor little</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">babies, nor der young moders—dem leastes’ ob all. Don’t mist’ess, dear.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“I _must_ Henny. It is the only chance of saving your brother.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Oh, dear me! Oh, my heart’s ready for to break; but nebber mind—don’t</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">go, mist’ess, don’t go. Let him die, mist’ess, tain’t nothin’ only _but_</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">death arter all! an’ Admirable Cockburn, ’save his funnelly soul, can’t</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">do nuffin’ ’tall _but_ kill him. An’, poor fellow, he hadn’ long to live</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">no how, wid a’sumption in his breas’, an’ so it on’y comes a little</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">sooner an’ a little deffunt like. Don’t go, Miss Kate, dear, let him</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">die. I’se his sister, an’ I’se been a mammy to him, but I sez so, an’</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">_he’d_ say so, too, brother Jack would, ef he could on’y speak long o’</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">you! Sure he’d lay down his life willin’, an’ so would us all, sooner</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">’an you should fall in wid Admirable Cockburn.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“I know it, Henny! I know it! Don’t talk to me any longer, though every</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">word you say but fixes my resolution to go.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Oh, Miss Kate! oh! _don’t, don’t_,” exclaimed Henny, clasping her</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">knees, and repeating all the arguments and entreaties she had used</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">before. But Catherine was firm as sad.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“If you _mus’_ make an effort, sen’ a messenger long of a note, Miss</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Kate. Dar! do dat—now dat’s a good trought.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Ah, Heaven forbid! I have had enough of risking poor ignorant</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">creatures, who cannot keep themselves out of danger.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Well, den, Miss Kate, _who_ is you gwine for to take long o’ you, to</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">wait on you, chile?”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“There, give me my hat, Henny.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Yes, honey, _who’s_ you gwine to take wid you?”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“I told you no one, Henny—where are my gloves?”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Here dey is, honey. Oh, mist’ess, dat’s susanside, an’ nothin’ ’tall</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">else. Take Jeemes ’long o’ you! He’s brave as a lion—comes to ’fendin’</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">at _you_.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“No, James would need rest and food on the journey—I shall require—I</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">shall stop for neither. Besides there is not a horse here who could bear</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">his weight continuously for so long a journey. My strong little mountain</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">pony, I think, may carry my light weight to the journey’s end with very</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">little stopping.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Oh, Miss Kate! ’deed I shall pray for you.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Yes, do, Henny—that is the only way in which you can help me. Come, go</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">with me out.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Stay, mist’ess, stay one minute! Ise trought ob anoder trought.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Well?”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Long as you will go onattended, please don’t be ’noyed at what I’m</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">gwine to say.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Only be quick, Henny, that is all.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Well, den, ’long as you will go widout any ’fence or ’tection—”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Except the Lord, Henny.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Yes, honey, sure ’nough—’cept de Lord’s—hadn’t you better put</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">on—hem—a-hem—male boy’s clothes?”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“_What?_”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Wouldn’t it be more of a ’tection to you? Now, der’s a suit in de</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">house, you calls to min’, as ’ill jus’ fit you. Dem as ’longed to Miss</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Georgy, when she were a masquerade-play-actorin’ here wid de city folks,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">here one Christmas. Dey’d fit you to a tee.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“No, thank you, Henny!”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“You ain’t mad ’long o’ me for sayin’ of it, is you, Miss Kate?”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Mad? Poor girl! No, Henny.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Nor likewise ’noyed in yer feelin’s?”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“No, no, you did but mistake,” answered Catherine, getting into her</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">saddle, while James held the pony, and Henny affectionately arranged the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">riding skirt around her feet and handed her the whip.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“There, there, that will do; good-bye, all of you,” said Catherine,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">feverishly.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Henny burst into loud wailing. Catherine paused and laid her hand upon</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">her shoulder, silencing her while she said—</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“My poor girl, do not fear. I have committed myself to the Lord! I am in</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">His hands. I trust in Him, else I should not dare do this which seems to</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">you so much like madness. I trust in Him, and no evil can befall me.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“But oh! mist’ess, mist’ess! If you should arter al’ perish!”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“If I perish, I perish!—it will be no evil if the Lord permits it!”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“I doesn’t b’lieve de Lord am gwine fur to ’mit it! I feels safe ’bout</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">young mist’ess, _I_ does! I b’lieves how ef Admirable Cockburn or any of</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">his jail-birds was to come fur to sturve Mist’ess, trustin’ in Hebben as</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">she does, how a thunderbolt would strike him down sooner, an’ she as</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">puts her trus’ in de Lord, should come to any harm.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Yes, or a yethquake, if ne’ssary!” exclaimed the more ardent Henny. “I</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">ain’t ’feard for you no longer, mist’ess dear! Hebben is wid you!”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Catherine waved her hand in adieu, gave reins to her pony which bounded</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">beneath her, and seemed to fly over the lawn. She was fevered,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">excited—“mad inspired,” say either. Night was closing darkly around her,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">but its sedative shadows had no power to soothe her excited nerves—the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">dews were falling, but they had no efficacy to cool her fevered veins; a</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">long journey lay before her, but its length could not discourage her;</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">dangers were thickly strown about her path, but they could not appall</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">her; her only desire, her only anxiety, was to reach her destination in</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">season, if possible, to rescue this boy from death, because he was dear</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">to Clifton—dearer than she herself, his wife, was, she now thought; and</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">now her life itself seemed of little worth, since the hope that was</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">life’s earthly end, was laid low. Her only remaining hope was to save</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">this life—her only remaining fear, to fail in doing so.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Her path, for many miles, lay through the deep, interminable wilderness</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">of forest, that, rising and falling with the low mountain ranges,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">extended over more than half the county. Her path was so narrow, and the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">branches of the trees often so low and interlaced, that a single start</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">of her horse, or a single moment’s hesitation to bow her head, might</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">have dashed her brains out against the intersecting branches of the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">trees. And in the deep darkness of the night, and in the despairing</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">absence of her perceptive faculties, this danger beset her every</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">instant. But she rode on, like a monomaniac, strangely heedless, and,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">like a somnambulist, strangely preserved. As night deepened, and</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">lowered, and thickened around her in the awful depths of the wilderness,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">the distant howl of the hungry wolf, the nearer cry of the fierce wild</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">cat, and once the more fearful whistle-signal of some outlawed desperado</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">fell upon her ear. But even these appalling sounds struck no terror to a</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">heart, stunned by despair into insensibility to danger. And she rode on</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">through these terrific perils, strangely unconscious, and strangely</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">protected.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">At length, as she descended the last steep, and drew near to the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">outskirts of the wilderness, the lights of the small village of L——</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">gleamed through the interstices of the woods—appearing and disappearing,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">jack-o’-lanternlike, until she emerged from the forest and came full</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">upon the hamlet. It was so late at night, that all the houses were shut</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">and dark, and the only lights were those she had seen in the forest,—the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">lights of the stage and post-office. She passed like a meteor through</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">the gloomy street, eliciting only a “What the deuce was that?” from a</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">loiterer in the stage-office, who had seen her flight, and emerged again</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">upon an open plain, over which her road lay for many miles. Another</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">village gleamed up from the plains—was reached, passed, and left far</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">behind with the same lightning-like speed.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">She rode all night, less sensible to danger and fatigue than the hardy</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">little mountain pony that was carrying her light weight, but straining</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">every nerve and sinew in the service. The night was deeply dark—the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">clouds thick, heavy and lowering; she had no means of computing time or</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">distance, but farms, forests and fields continued to loom, appear and</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">vanish, as she fled past them. She watched the East with feverish</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">anxiety for day. But still mountain, meadow, and moorland came and went,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">as she approached and hurried by them, and still deep darkness hung like</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">a pall over Heaven and earth. Vainly she watched the East, for hamlet,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">village or town in turn was seen and reached and left behind, and still</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">a wall of dense blackness blocked up the Orient.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">A new and very serious danger threatened her every instant—her poor</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">horse, fatigued nearly to death, was ready to fall, and she did not know</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">it. He reeled and tottered, and stumbled and recovered himself many</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">times, and she did not see or feel it! nay, she mechanically exerted</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">every nerve and sinew to hold him up, and keep him on his feet, while</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">totally unconscious of her own exertion. Like a sleep walker was she in</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">her deep abstraction.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">She was in a deep forest again riding for life, and the veins in her</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">arms were swelled out like cords, with straining to hold the horse up on</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">his feet. She could no longer see the Eastern horizon, but it was</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">growing lighter, and she knew that morning was dawning. She rode on, and</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">on, and on, and at length came out of the forest in time to see the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">level rays of the rising sun striking redly across the fields. The</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">windows of a farm-house flashing back the early light gleamed upon her</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">vision, and at the same time her horse reeled and fell with her. “Good</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Lord!” “Are you hurt?” “Run here, Tim.” “Call your mist’ess, Peter.”</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Where are you hurt, lady? can you tell us?”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Catherine awoke as out of a dream, to see many people around her all</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">asking questions, and all attempting to extricate her from her saddle.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">She passed her hand across her brow, as was her wont when trying to</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">dispel thought, and she looked at them in perplexity.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“My Lord, I’m afraid she’s very much hurt! Can you speak, lady? Where is</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">your injury?” said the eldest man of the party, at length, lifting her</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">in his arms.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“I—no—I’m not hurt—not the least; is the horse?”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“We don’t know, ma’am; I’m sure it’s a blessed thing you’re not killed</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">yourself,” said another of the group, who, with several more, were</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">trying to raise the pony upon his legs.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Pray put me down upon my feet. Thank you. I’m not hurt. How far is</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Washington City from this place?” said Catherine, as she stood watching</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">her horse.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Good forty miles, lady. I don’t think he’s hurt, but poor fellow, he’s</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">trembling with fatigue,” said the farmer, answering her, and then</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">examining the horse, which was raised at last and stood trembling and</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">blowing.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Can he take me to Washington to-day?” asked Catherine, as she leaned</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">against the fence for support.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“_He?_—Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha! Why look at him, lady: Besides, can you go</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">there yourself anyhow? Why you’re ready to drop now! Better go in and</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">let the old woman put you to bed and give you some breakfast.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“It is true I’m very stiff and weary—having ridden all night. But I must</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">reach Washington without delay; there is one I care about under sentence</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">of death. If I reach there in time, I may get a reprieve and save him. I</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">_must_ go to-day.” Catherine spoke this, frequently pausing for breath.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">When she ceased—</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Some of her ‘lations gwine to be hung, an’ she gwine to see President</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Madison to get him off! May depen’, that’s it!” whispered one farm</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">laborer to another.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Can you let me have a horse to take me there to-day? I will pay</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">twice—ten times his value,” said Catherine, raising her heavy eyelids to</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">the old farmer’s kind face.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Lady, I’ll let you have another horse in two hours from this, on</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">condition that you go in to my old woman and take some refreshment, and</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">lie down to rest for that time. And not a minute sooner, and not on any</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">other terms whatsoever, even if it was your father was going to be</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">hanged—would I let you have a horse; because I see very clearly that,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">unless you take some rest, you will drop down dead before you get a mile</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">farther on your road.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“It is true—it is the voice of Providence, I think—I thank you very</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">much; I will rest. Please take care of my poor pony.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“He shall be looked after, lady. Take my arm.” And the worthy farmer</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">drew Catherine’s arm within his own, and carefully and respectfully</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">supported her to the house, where he gave her into the charge of his</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">wife, saying, “Here, wait upon this lady, honey! be a mother to her,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">honey! for she’s sorrowfully in want of one.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">The farmer’s wife placed her in a stuffed chair, drew off her gloves,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">untied her hat and removed it, unfastened her spencer, and asked her if</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">she would have breakfast, which was just ready to go on the table.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“No, thank you. You are very kind. The Lord reward you. But—rest, I want</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">only rest,” said Catherine, ready to swoon, for the sense of fatigue was</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">growing upon her.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Yes, _rest_, that’s all she wants, or rather that’s the most she wants</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">now! Put her to bed! let her sleep for two hours, and have a cup of</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">strong coffee and a broiled chicken ready for her when she wakes. That</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">will set her up again, and help her to reach her journey’s end,” said</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">the kind-hearted man.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Supported by the farmer’s wife, Catherine was guided up the stairs to a</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">cool and quiet room, where she dropped upon the bed. No sooner had her</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">head touched the pillow, than the room, the white-washed wall, blue</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">window-curtains, the evergreens on the whitened fire-place, the picture</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">of the annunciation over the mantle-piece—all reeled around her senses</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">as a vision, and wheeled off, carrying with them the outside world and</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">all consciousness of being.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">To her, existence was blotted out for two hours.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Wake up, lady: wake up! your breakfast is ready, and so is your horse!”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Catherine started up at the voice of her landlady, and gazed around,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">bewildered. Then memory flashed upon her, and she sprung to her feet,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">and began hastily and nervously to fasten her habit.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Here is water, lady, and napkins—and is there anything else I can bring</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">you?”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“No, thank you, you are very good.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“How do you find yourself?”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Better—I think. How long have I slept?”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Just two hours. I wished to let you lie longer, but my dear old fellow</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">insisted on keeping his word with you.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“I’m glad he did. It was very needful. But you are kind, and I thank</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">you.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Catherine bathed her head and face, and the good hostess combed and</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">arranged her hair, and fastened her habit and took her down stairs,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">where a comfortable breakfast awaited her. It was yet but seven o’clock,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">and the farmer assured her that she had time enough to reach Washington</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">by night-fall, and that she would be far better able to do it from</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">having had this rest. She hastily swallowed a few mouthfuls of food,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">drank a cup of strong coffee, that gave her a sort of fictitious</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">strength, and then arose from the table and quickly prepared to resume</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">her journey. The good woman followed her with many kind wishes, and the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">good man set her in her saddle, and while adjusting her comfortably,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">gave directions about the nearest way to W——, the next considerable town</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">upon the road. Then he gave her the reins, and prayed God to bless her.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">She thanked her kind hosts earnestly again, put whip to her horse and</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">galloped away, leaving her valuable pony in pledge.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">The farm-house, with its garden, orchard and vineyard, barns,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">wheat-stack and stubble-fields vanished behind her flying steed. The</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">country was now open, and she flew on and on before the wind. And now</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">she had entered the forest, and she hurried through its deep shadows,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">flecked with golden sun-glances. When she emerged again, and found</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">herself in the open meadows, it was high noon, and the August sun was</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">pouring down his burning rays with intolerable power. But on and on she</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">rode, unconscious of suffering in herself, and unheedful of the fatigue</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">of her panting and perspiring steed.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">It was two hours past noon when she reached the town of W——, and at the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">very first inn on the suburbs her horse stopped, of his own will, nor</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">could she, with all her efforts, persuade or force him to budge a step.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">A boy, a colored woman, and then the landlord, his wife and all the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">children came out, to see a lady riding, unattended, who could not make</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">her horse go.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“He wants food and drink, I suppose,” said Catherine, to the landlord,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">who at last came to offer her aid. And then she alighted, and requesting</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">the host to have the animal attended, very quickly, followed the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">landlady, who conducted her into the rustic parlor. She was now so</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">fatigued and stiffened, that the act of standing or walking was really</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">painful, so she sank down upon the lounge, and declining all the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">landlady’s offers of refreshment, waited a weary half hour, while her</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">horse was feeding. At the end of that time, she mounted again, and</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">resumed her journey. She passed through the town, and over the wooded</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">hills that environed it on the east, and came down upon the plains. The</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">heat of the afternoon was of that close, breathless, insufferable kind,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">that always forebodes an awful storm. The sense of suffering was</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">beginning to force itself upon her, and as for the animal she rode, she</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">could not, by any means, coax or drive him beyond a walk. Then her mind</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">became again anxiously concentrated upon the end of her journey, to the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">total exclusion of all other thought, and all sense. It was in this</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">state that she arrived at the foot of a steep hill, covered with</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">copse-wood, ascended its top, descended the other side, and reached a</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">small river at its foot. She drew up her feet, doubled her riding-skirt</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">up over the horse’s shoulders, and guided him into the ford, and—with</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">the water splashing around, and rising even to the animal’s neck, she</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">crossed the river—so mechanically, so unconsciously, that had people</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">asked her, thereafter, whether she had forded a stream in her journey,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">she could not have told them.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">The sun was declining to his setting, and the sky was heavy with clouds,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">while still the air was close, sultry, stifling and oppressive.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Everything indicated the approach before long of a tremendous tornado.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">The shades of evening were falling thickly around her when she was</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">passing through the dense, low-lying forest south-west of Washington.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">When she emerged from its deep obscurity and came out into the open</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">country, an alarming phenomenon arrested her attention; the eastern</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">horizon was luridly lighted by a low, dull, red glow, like the earliest</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">dawn of a wintry morning. Her road led directly towards this murky</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">light, and her eyes were fascinated to it. As she rode and gazed, the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">blood-tinged illumination seemed to glow and brighten on her vision, and</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">presently after, began to send up meteoric streams of fire towards the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">clouds. As the distance lessened between herself and the awful</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">conflagration, it began to illumine her path more and more distinctly</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">and fearfully, until every object for miles around was plainly visible</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">in the lurid glare. And then at last Catherine recognized it for a</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">burning city—the city of Washington wrapped in flames!</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">On descending the road towards the Potomac, a scene difficult to</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">describe met her view. All up and down the river and on either shore,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">were seen in the red glare multitudes of fugitives—some seeking to</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">cross, some in boats on the water, and some landed and hurrying in</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">disorder up the country. Soon after this, she met great numbers of</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">terrified women and children, flying from their desolated homes. The</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">greatest possible consternation and confusion prevailed among these</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">panic-stricken fugitives. The most terrific reports were rife: That the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">enemy were in hot pursuit—that the slaves had been incited to revolt,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">and mad with emancipation, and drunk with all manner of licentious</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">excess, were perpetrating more horrible and revolting atrocities than</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">those which at Hampton, the year before, steeped the country in blood</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">and shame.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Rendered by despair senseless as the dead to all those dangers,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Catherine laboriously pushed and threaded her way down the road, blocked</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">up with horses, carriages, foot-passengers, baggage wagons, cattle, and</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">all the miscellaneous emptyings of a hastily and fearfully evacuated</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">city. As she drew near the Long Bridge, she heard by the frightened talk</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">of the flying multitude, that the end of the bridge on the Virginia side</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">had been burned to prevent, or at least delay, the pursuit of the enemy.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">She then turned her horse’s head up the course of the river, with the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">intention of crossing by the Georgetown Ferry. She had no trouble in</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">picking her way through the thicket under the hills that bordered the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Potomac from this point, for every minutest object on the way was made</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">painfully distinct by the light of the burning city. When nearly</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">opposite Georgetown, she descried the ferry-boat put off from the other</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">shore, and propelled rapidly across the river. She stopped her horse,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">intending to wait and return with it. In less than five minutes it</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">touched the beach, and a carriage with a small party of ladies, escorted</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">by a guard of nine cavalry volunteers, landed.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">In the hurried consultation that ensued among them, Catherine learned</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">that the party consisted of Mrs. Madison and her friends and attendants,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">flying from the burning Presidential Mansion. When they had turned their</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">horses’ heads up the river road, Catherine rode down to the boat, and</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">addressed herself to the ferryman, asking to be taken over. The man</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">looked at her in astonishment, and when he saw that she was in earnest,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">advised her strongly against the trip, telling her that she had best</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">turn rein and ride as fast and as far as possible in the opposite</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">direction—that every one had fled or was flying from Washington, that</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">the city was in the undisputed possession of the enemy, who were</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">demolishing, burning and laying waste the metropolis at pleasure. There</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">was no need to tell that—the fact was awfully visible by the light of</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">the great conflagration. But Catherine still persisted in her purpose,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">replying to his objections that some one whom she did not wish to desert</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">was in the hands of the enemy; and at last prevailed upon him to put her</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">across.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">She was landed on the flats west of the city. Here crowds of women and</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">children, pale with terror, and weeping and wailing for their ruined</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">city and lost homes, waited impatiently to be taken across the river,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">out of the way of more horrible fates, which the atrocious reputation of</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Cockburn and his Cossacks reasonably taught them to dread. Catherine</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">left them hurrying in mad confusion into the boat, while she hastened on</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">to the very scene of peril from which they were flying. She passed</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">swiftly over the low and marshy fields that then lay between the river</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">and the heart of the city, and entered upon Twenty-first Street, above</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">the War Department, and turned into Pennsylvania Avenue.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">What a scene! Volumes of smoke, as from an enormous volcano, were</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">disgorged in massive clouds, and settled like a black canopy over the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">doomed city. The President’s Palace and the Treasury Building, swathed</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">in their shrouds of fire, illumined all the scene with terrific</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">splendor. Even at the distance of several hundred yards off, her eyes</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">ached with the insufferable light and scorching heat. At the distance of</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">a mile, the Capitol, wrapped in its mantle of flame, sent forth a</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">hail-storm of sparks and burning brands.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">In strange and awful contrast to this appalling progress of destruction,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">was the dread silence that reigned over the falling city. All the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">terror, consternation, hurry and distraction were left without. Here,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">upon the very scene of action, all was comparatively quiet. The houses</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">were shut up, and if they contained any inmates, they were hiding in</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">obscurity. The streets seemed forsaken by the conquerors, as by the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">conquered. There was no shout of soldiery, no martial music, no sign</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">expression of a grand military triumph anywhere, no sound to be heard</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">from the powerful enemy in possession, except a distant, dull, heavy,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">monotonous tramp, as of many retreating hoofs. The flames were doing</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">their work of destruction in silence, only broken by the occasional</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">crash of some falling roof, cupola, or pillar, or some reverberating</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">explosion. Catherine passed under the blinding glare and scathing heat</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">of the burning Treasury Building, and turning the elbow of the Avenue,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">came upon a sentinel, who instantly levelled his musket and challenged</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">her, with “Who goes there?”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“The Admiral,” said Catherine, drawing rein.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">The sentinel lowered his musket with a surly “Pass on,” followed by a</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">low, insulting comment. Catherine had merely intended to express her</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">errand, and had chanced upon the countersign.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Where shall I find your commander?” she next said.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“The General?”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“No—Admiral Cockburn.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Corporal,” said the soldier, in a low, distinct voice. The Corporal of</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">the Guard advanced.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“What did you want, mum?”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“To be conducted to the presence of the Admiral,” answered Catherine,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">with an imploring glance. Perhaps some thing in her countenance moved</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">the pity of the officer—perhaps he thought her a sufferer from the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">devastation of the city. At least he volunteered to be her guide, and</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">requesting her to accompany him, led the way down the avenue towards the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Capitol.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Did you know, mum, that a curfew had been proclaimed, and the citizens</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">forbidden to appear in the streets after eight o’clock in the evening?”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“No, and if I had, I should have been still obliged to disregard it, for</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">a matter of more than life and death hangs upon my interview with the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Admiral,” replied Catherine, speaking out of the fullness of her heart.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">The distance between the Treasury Building and the Capitol was about one</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">mile, and the glare of the conflagration at each end, revealed a line of</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">sentinels, posted at regular intervals the whole length of the avenue.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">A ride of ten minutes brought them to the encampment of the enemy on the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Capitol Hill, east of the burning edifice. Here, indeed, prevailed much</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">of the noise and disorder consequent upon the relaxation of discipline</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">after a day of severe action. Nearly four thousand men were resting,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">some leaning upon their muskets, some seated upon the grass, and some</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">flat upon the ground, in the death-like sleep of drunkenness or</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">exhaustion.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">A group of officers, with their gorgeous scarlet and gold laced dresses</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">resplendant in the glare, stood watching the progress of the fire.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Towards these the Corporal conducted Catherine. One from among them</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">advanced, laughing coarsely, as he exclaimed—“Who have we got here,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Corporal?—a woman, by George! and a young and pretty one, too, to judge</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">by the pretty figure. You’re welcome, madam. What, afraid? Well, I</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">suppose you have formed a terrible opinion of me from the newspapers,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">which delight to represent us all as devils. Never fear me. Satan is not</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">half so black as the saints paint him! You shall be far safer under any</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">government than under Madison’s. Ross says he makes no war upon letters</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">or ladies. Ho, ho, ho! Ross—_he’s_ sentimental, you know! Well! d——</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">letters, but _I_ make no war upon ladies either, except with Cupid’s</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">weapons—ho, ho, ho, ho, ho! What, afraid still. Come! let’s see your</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">face; never saw a shy woman yet that had not a face worth seeing.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Abashed at this manner of address, Catherine hung her head, until the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Corporal whispered—</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Rear Admiral Cockburn.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Then she stole a glance at the speaker.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">A flashy, overdressed, yet slovenly person, a florid complexion, a</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">clear, mirthful, audacious blue eye—a sensual mouth, and a free,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">dashing, insolent manner, marked the licensed Pirate of the Chesapeake,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">and the boon companion of the profligate Prince of Wales.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“What, shy yet! By your leave, my dear!” said the Admiral, chucking his</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">hand under Catherine’s chin, and raising her face. Poor Kate’s face, as</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">well as her hair and her dress, was stained with dust and tears and</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">perspiration, and her features were pale and haggard with sorrow,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">anxiety and extreme fatigue. The profligate dropped her chin with a</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">start, as if it had burnt him, exclaiming—</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Whisht! Ugh! Brownies and kelpies, and witches on broomsticks! Oh! ho,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">ho, ho, ho, ho! _Ugh!_ what a face! Here, Corporal, I pass her over to</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">you; you seem to be kindly disposed. There is no accounting for tastes,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">so—Oh! ho, ho, ho, ho, ho! I make you a present of her. _Oh-h!_ where</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">can I find a dozen pretty girls to get the cross out of my eyes?”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Mortified, repulsed, despairing, Catherine stood by her horse, with one</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">arm thrown around his neck, and her head resting upon it.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">A low hum of voices around her, seemingly incident upon some one’s</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">arrival on the scene of action, and then a sweet, deep-toned voice near</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">her, inquiring—</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Can we be so happy as to serve you in any way, lady, I should be most</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">grateful for the opportunity. To be able to render any service is always</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">a most soothing amelioration to me of the harsh duties of war.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Major-General Ross,” whispered the friendly Corporal, stooping to her</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">ear.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Catherine raised her head, and saw, bending towards her, a very handsome</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">man, in the early prime of life, of a grave, sweet, thoughtful, and</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">somewhat melancholy expression of countenance, who regarding her with</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">respectful sympathy, repeated his offers of service, saying—</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“If I am so fortunate as to be able to assist you, lady, pray do not</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">hesitate a moment to command me.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Thank you, thank you—I—wished to speak with the Admiral—but—”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“With _me_! oh, ho, ho, ho, ho! I beg your pardon! I beg to decline the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">honor! Talk to Ross—he’s sentimental, _and_—responsible! the father of a</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">family, etc.—‘a married man myself, with several sweet children, and</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">venerate the sanctity,’[3] etc. Eh, Ross? Oh, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho!”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Footnote 3:</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Words used by the generous and unfortunate General Ross, while trying</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>to soothe the fears of Mrs. E——</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Speak with me, lady. I shall be most happy to aid you. What is it? Have</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">you or yours suffered, or received any injury by our soldiers that I can</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">redress? Can I help you in any way?” asked General Ross, in gentle,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">earnest tones.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Yes, yes, I think you may have power to do me a vital service.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Name it, lady. My word is pledged.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“His word is pledged! Oh, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho!—pledged to a</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">scare-crow!—pledged to a kelpie!—pledged to a witch on a broomstick! Oh,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">ho, ho, ho, ho, ho! _Oh-h!_” shouted the coarse Admiral.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">The eye of Ross flashed for an instant, but sheathed its fire as he</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">turned to Catherine, and, taking her hand respectfully, drew her aside</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">from the proximity of the brutal Cockburn, who, in addition to his other</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">graces, was now doubly inflamed by drink and triumph.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“A tryste! a tryste with the Queen of the Kelpies! Oh, ho, ho, ho, ho,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">ho!” roared the Admiral, holding his sides, and bending forward to shout</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">his insulting laughter, and then stalking off.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Explain, lady. I shall be proud to serve you. Pray have confidence in</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">me, madam, and believe in the sincerity of my words,” said General Ross,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">still holding her hand, while she passed her other one slowly to and fro</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">across her forehead, as was her habit when embarrassed, trying to clear</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">her mind and arrange her thoughts.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">But as soon as she was relieved from the presence of the coarse and</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">insolent Cockburn, she recovered breath and self-possession, and spoke</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">clearly and to the point.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“I thank you, sir,—I deeply thank you. I will tell you. I heard, in my</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">distant mountain home, that my husband, Major Clifton, of the ——</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Regiment of Volunteers, had been dangerously wounded in the action at</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">St. Leonard’s. I did not hear that he had also been taken prisoner.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Believing him to be still in the American camp, and fearing that he</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">needed more constant attention than he could get, and feeling very</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">anxious to hear directly from him, I sent his favorite servant to find</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">him, directing the man to remain with him, and to write me of his state.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">He, this servant, was a poor, rustic negro, sir, totally ignorant of the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">usages of war. When he reached the American camp, he discovered that his</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">master was a prisoner on board the British fleet. He procured a boat and</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">boarded the Albion. He was taken as a spy, of course, and, to end the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">miserable story, awaits only the orders of Admiral Cockburn to be</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">executed. I heard that yesterday evening, and I instantly set off, and</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">between that hour and this have ridden more than seventy miles, almost</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">without stopping for food or rest, and entered the city to-night alone,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">when all were flying from it, to beg this man’s life from the Admiral.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Now, you know, _you know_, how vital is my request, my prayer.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“You could not have done more for your father, lady!” replied General</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Ross, with a gentle, earnest wonder on his fine countenance. “You could</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">not have done more for your father than you have done for this slave.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Do not wonder, sir. He would have laid down his life for us. But, oh,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">sir! time presses—death threatens!”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Be at peace, lady! The life or death of this slave, of such vital</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">importance to you, is really a matter of so little moment to Admiral</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Cockburn, that I have not the slightest hesitation in promising to</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">secure for you his pardon and liberation.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Oh, may the Lord forever bless you, sir! I never, never can tell you</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">how grateful I am—”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Peace, peace, dear lady. It is absolutely nothing. I would to Heaven I</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">could really do anything to merit your kind word and kind remembrance,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">when others are cursing me for what the stern duties of war force me to</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">do!”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“I shall ever remember you, sir, with the deepest gratitude.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“And now, Mrs. Clifton, you must have rest and refreshment. My</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">head-quarters are at Doctor E——’s. His amiable family are at home. They</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">will gladly afford you comfort and assistance. Permit me to conduct you</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">thither.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">He replaced her carefully in her saddle, and taking the reins, led her</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">horse until they reached the commodious mansion of Doctor E——. Here he</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">introduced Mrs. Clifton, who was received with respect and sympathy.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Leaving her in the care of the kind and hospitable family, he then set</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">out to seek Admiral Cockburn.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Catherine was shown to a chamber, and afforded the refreshments of a</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">partial bath and food. After which she lay down on a sofa, to rest, and</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">await the return of the gentle and generous Ross.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">In about half an hour she was summoned to the parlor, where she found</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">him standing. He advanced to meet her, and said—</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Mrs. Clifton, I have the pardon here, but I very much fear—” and his</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">face clouded over—“I very much fear it will be too late.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“‘_Too late!_’” echoed Catherine, sinking into a chair, as she repeated</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">the saddest words in the language—“Too late. Is he dead?” she asked,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">covering her face with her hands.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“No, Mrs. Clifton, but he has been ordered for execution at eight</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">o’clock to-morrow.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“IT IS NOT TOO LATE!” exclaimed Catherine, starting up, with electric</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">energy. “Give me—oh! give me the pardon!—I will take it there in time!”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Lady, the distance is over forty miles—and the necessary delays, and</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">the dangers that threaten a young female, traveling alone by night,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">through a country infested—”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“_Oh!_ give me the pardon! give it me, I implore you! I will take it</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">there safely, and in time! Heaven has protected me through dangers as</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">great, and Heaven will protect me through these! Oh, for the love of</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Heaven, do not hesitate! Every moment is inestimable when a ‘_too late_’</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">threatens us! Give me the pardon!”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Nay, lady, I can send a courier with the pardon, rather than that you</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">should go, for many reasons.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Oh, no, no, your courier would want to stop, to eat and drink—or he</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">might fall in with some of our people, and be killed or taken,—or if he</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">escaped, through his explanation of his errand—why, that very errand</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">would be rendered futile, by the time lost in investigation. _I_ shall</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">pause for nothing. Heaven will protect and speed me. Oh! give me the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">pardon. Do not delay! _All_ depends upon promptitude. Alas! excuse my</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">importunity! but give me the pardon!”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">General Ross attempted to dissuade her; but neither arguments nor</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">persuasions had the least effect upon her resolution. At last, overruled</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">by her earnestness, vehemence and faith, he yielded—handed her the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">pardon, and went out to see if he could procure her a fresh horse.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">When he entered again, after a successful search, he found her equipped</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">for her second night’s journey, and standing in the midst of her</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">astonished hosts. He informed her that her horse was ready, and also</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">that he had provided her a guard, to escort her beyond Bladensburg. Then</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">she took a hasty and grateful leave of her amiable entertainers, and</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">accepting the arm of the Major-General, left the house.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">As General Ross placed her in the saddle, and handed her the reins, he</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">said—</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Heaven protect and speed you, lady. Farewell—and sometimes remember</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">me.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“I will remember and pray for General Ross while I live,” said</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Catherine. And then she put whip to her horse, and rode away, upheld by</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">a wonderful energy.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>

<p class="p3"><span class="s2"><span class="Apple-converted-space">                               </span>THE GOAL.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2"><span class="Apple-converted-space">                </span>Thro’ waves, thro’ storms and clouds</span></p>

<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Incalculable is the power of the spirit over the flesh. In the intense</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">absorption of her soul by one hope, Catherine was carried above all</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">consciousness of the excessive exertion, and all sense of the extreme</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">fatigue that was oppressing and harassing her bodily powers almost to</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">dissolution. But a watchful Providence, that had already thrice arrested</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">her dreadful journey, now a fourth time interposed to compel her to</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">rest. She had parted with her escort, when past the British outposts,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">beyond Bladensburg. And by the time she had reached Long Old Fields, the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">storm, that had been threatening all the evening, burst suddenly, with</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">terrible violence, driving her for shelter into a farm-house. And again,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">wondering and compassionate hosts persuaded her to lie down and repose,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">and once more, as soon as her weary head dropped upon the pillow, deep</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">sleep, like an irresistible mandate of the All-Merciful, fell upon her,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">and, despite of pain of body and anguish of mind, she slept soundly for</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">several hours;—slept, as the prisoner sleeps the night before</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">execution;—slept, as the martyr sleeps in the intervals of torture upon</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">the rack;—slept, while the tempest raged with awful fury;—while the rain</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">fell in torrents, and the wind rushed through the forest, carrying</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">destruction on its wings; while gigantic trees were twisted off, or torn</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">up by the roots, and great rivers were swelled to floods;—she slept the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">deep, dreamless sleep “God giveth His beloved.” Probably to this</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Providential sleep she owed the preservation of her life, for the spirit</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">that can goad the flesh to exertion unto death, cannot save it from</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">dissolution.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">When she awoke, the storm had passed, and the stars were shining dimly</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">in the early dawn of day. She started up, remorseful and affrighted to</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">find she had slept so long, and to recollect that her journey was not</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">half over. It was now four o’clock, and she had yet nearly thirty miles</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">to ride before eight, or all was lost! Her pitying hosts tried to</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">persuade her to wait and partake of their early breakfast, which, they</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">said, would be ready in half an hour; but finding her bent upon setting</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">forward, they hastily got some refreshment together, and permitted her</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">to mount her horse and depart. But she had not proceeded many yards,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">before she found that the motion of her steed gave her great pain—pain</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">so sharp, as to force itself to be felt through all her intense mental</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">abstraction. She checked her horse’s trot, and put him into a gallop,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">whose smooth, wavy motion, somewhat relieved her distress.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">The morning was sparklingly brilliant after the storm: the forest trees</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">and the grass were spangled by the rain-drops, and the slanting rays of</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">the rising run striking deep into the foliage, flecked all its green</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">leaves with golden light. Her horse was fresh, his blood was up, and on</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">they sped like an arrow through the woods.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Suddenly she stopped and reeled backwards—that sharp pain again; it</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">pierced her side and chest like a sword; it caught away her breath, and</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">caused the drops of perspiration to burst from her pale forehead. But</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">not for pain, or even for the fear of death, must she pause. She might</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">perish, but her purpose must first be accomplished, if possible.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Bracing her nerves, and steeling her soul against the sense of</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">suffering, she put whip to her horse, and flew on, as before the wind,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">leaving forest, meadow and hamlet—farm-house, field and flood, far</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">behind her. Again and again the sharp agony arrested her, like the hand</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">of death—but in vain to stop her progress—each time the pang could only</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">delay her a moment, and then on and on she sped, spurning the ground</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">away in her desperate flight.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Before her, in the distance, glimmered the blue Patuxent, the longed-for</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">goal. Oh! that river; for an hour past it had seemed as near as now.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Would she ever approach it? On and on she sped, while woods and towns</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">and plains whirled behind her in a mad reel. A fearful change was coming</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">over her. The sense of pain, with all other sense, had gradually left</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">her. A stupor of weariness supervened; her brain reeled, her sight</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">failed. Oh! that river, how it gleamed and disappeared, and gleamed</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">again before her. Would she ever, ever be nearer to it? How dim the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">sunlight was, and how unsteady the ground; and the boundaries of the sky</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">and earth were molten together and lost; and it was no longer the action</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">of her horse, but the dreadful rocking and upheaving of the ground, that</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">kept her moving, moving, moving, forever. Oh! that river! how it</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">glimmered and sparkled, and sparkled and flashed into her brain. Would</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">she ever, ever, ever reach it, or was she going round in a circle</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">forever? Reason was failing at last—past, present and future—things that</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">were, and things that seemed, swam thickly together upon brain and</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">heart; surely the hour of dissolution had come, for dense darkness and</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">heaviness were settling like grave clods upon brain and heart. Oh! God,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">that river!—had she really reached it at last, or was it an illusion of</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">delirium? Its waves rolled and flashed in silvery splendor at the foot</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">of the hill, below her feet! But what was that? Angels in Heaven! what</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">was that? A sight to call back ebbing life! Down in the dell, the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">glitter of bayonets and the glow of scarlet coats—an open square of</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">British infantry, enclosing an execution scene! Clutching the pardon</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">from her bosom, and holding it aloft at arm’s length, she roused her</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">fast failing strength for a last effort, and hurled herself and steed</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">furiously down the hill upon the scene of doom. The flash of steel</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">around her—the gallows tree—the cart—the prisoner—the fatal noose—and</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">more than all, close beside her, the form of him—her own—her</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Clifton—madly loved in life and death, and then—darkness closed in upon</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">her life, and all was lost.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">As the reins fell from powerless hands upon the horse’s neck, the noble</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">animal stood stock still; had he lifted a leg, it must have been fatal</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">to the swooning rider; but he stood like a statue, while her form swayed</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">to and fro for a moment, and then Archer Clifton sprang forward and</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">received her in his arms. He picked up the paper as it fell from her</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">stiffening fingers, and guessing its purport, passed it to the officer</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">in command. Then he sank upon one knee, drew her insensible form to and</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">supported it against his breast, while he untied her hat and loosened</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">her spencer.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">A little bustle ensued around him; but he did not heed it, bending over</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Catherine. The execution was stayed, the prisoner released and poor</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Jack, half-dead with terror before and half mad with joy now, had still</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">strength and sense and affection enough left to run to a spring hard by,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">and dip up his hat full of water, and the next instant he was kneeling</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">with it by the side of his mistress, to bathe her hands.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Who is she?” “Where did she come from?” “What is her name?” “Who _is_</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">the lady?” “Do you know her, sir?” asked some of the officers, crowding</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">around with offers of assistance.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“This lady is my wife, gentlemen! Air! air, if you please!” exclaimed</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Archer Clifton, waving them off, and giving his sole attention to</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Catherine. “Kate!”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">The sound of that thrilling voice—the clasp of those thrilling arms, had</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">power to call back her spirit from the confines of the invisible world.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Her pale, pale eyelids quivered.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Kate!” he exclaimed again, raising her higher upon his breast.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">A shuddering sigh convulsed her bosom—her languid eyes unclosed.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Kate!”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Yes, Kate!” she echoed, nodding her head with that quick, nervous,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">spasmodic gesture common to her.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“And why have you done this thing? Why have you placed yourself _en</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">scene_ like a third-rate opera dancer?”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">She raised her fading eyes to his face, pleadingly, murmuring—</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Your wishes—the reprieve!”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Well, what of that? Was there no one to bring it but yourself?”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Too feeble to enter upon the long explanation required, she only shook</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">her head, murmuring at intervals—</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Forgive—forgive—I could not see him die. Patience, patience—indeed, I</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">will not trouble you, love,—I will go away again, far away! Maybe God</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">will let me die!”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">The last words were breathed forth in a long, deep sigh, and she sank</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">away again into insensibility.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Poor Jack, kneeling by her side, bathed her hand with the water he had</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">brought, and with his tears that fell like rain.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Major Clifton laid her head down upon the green sward, and rising to his</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">feet, addressed the officer in command, saying—</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Sir, I am a prisoner of war, as you know. Yet, my wife is in a dying</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">state here, and I wish to convey her to a place of safety and repose.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Major Clifton will consider himself on his parole, and command any</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">assistance we may be able to render him or his heroic wife,” said</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Captain ——, at the same time showing him a note from General Ross to</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">that effect, which had been folded in with the pardon.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“I think, sir,” added the officer, “that there is a farm-house near</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">here, belonging to a planter of the name of Greenfield, where your lady</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">would be hospitably received, and well taken care of; perhaps you had</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">better send your servant thither to borrow a carriage.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Thanking the officer for his civility and good advice, Major Clifton</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">immediately acted upon it by dispatching Jack to the house, while he</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">himself supported Catherine until the arrival of the carriage. He then</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">placed her in it, and she was driven slowly to “Greenwood.” Here she was</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">kindly received by the planter’s wife and sisters, who tenderly</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">undressed her and put her to bed. A physician was summoned, who, when he</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">arrived and looked at her and felt her pulse, and heard the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">circumstances, pronounced her insensibility to be not a swoon, but a</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">trance-coma—the result of excessive fatigue of mind and body. He said</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">that such stupors, if prematurely broken, might end in convulsions and</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">madness—or if left, too, to themselves, might terminate in death; that</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">her state was exceedingly critical, and that her rest was by no means to</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">be broken, unless there was a perceptible failure in her pulse, in which</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">case the stimulants and restorative he should leave must be applied and</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">administered, and himself instantly summoned. And so he left her.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Having seen Catherine thus at rest, and having received many assurances</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">from her gentle-hearted hostess that every care and attention should be</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">given her, Major Clifton took leave, and returned to render himself up</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">to his captors, who were just about to return to their ship. He went</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">with them. And when they had arrived on board the Albion, an agreeable</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">surprise awaited him. A gentleman in the uniform of an American general</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">stood upon the deck, attended by a flag of truce, and Major Clifton</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">immediately recognized Colonel (now General) Conyers, who instantly</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">advanced to meet him, and shaking hands heartily, exclaimed—</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“You did not expect to find me here? I have come concerning the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">arrangement of a change of prisoners. Colonel Lithgow of his Britannic</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Majesty’s —— Regiment and taken prisoner by our people in the same</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">engagement in which _you_ fell into the hands of the enemy, is now</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">offered in exchange for yourself.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Yes, sir,” said Captain ——, advancing towards them, “and I am</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">exceedingly happy to say that an exchange has been effected, and to</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">congratulate you on your restoration to liberty.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Major Clifton bowed deeply, and requested the use of a boat to leave the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">ship.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Nay—yourself and General Conyers will stay and dine with us?” asked</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Captain ——.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">But Major Clifton, thanking him for his invitation, and also for much</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">kindness and attention received during his sojourn as a captive among</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">them, declined remaining longer, and repeated his request for a boat.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Oh, _mine_ is here at your service. _I_ am going ashore with you of</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">course,” said General Conyers.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“I beg your pardon, sir! the boat you came in has been taken by Captain</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Fairfax, who has gone ashore with it.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Ah, true!”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“_Captain Fairfax?_” asked Archer Clifton.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Yes, my friend, Captain Fairfax. Frank accompanied me hither in search</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">of _yourself_. Some news of vital importance he had to communicate,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">which he did not impart to me. He could not wait for your return at all,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">so he went ashore in search of you. He would have found you sooner if he</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">had waited here, which proves the truth of the old proverb—“Most haste,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">least speed.””</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“The boat is manned, sir,” said a lieutenant to Major Clifton.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">General Conyers and himself then took leave of the British officers,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">entered the boat, and were rowed swiftly to the land. As soon as they</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">had stepped upon the beach, and found themselves alone, Conyers grasped</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">the hand of Clifton, and shaking it cordially, said—</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“So, you have won noble Catherine? Well, I congratulate you with a whole</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">heart, though you have won her from my hopes.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Won her from your hopes?”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Ay, Archer, I loved her.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Loved her?”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Yes, and love her!”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Love her?”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Yes, and shall _always_ love her, highly and purely though, as a saint</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">loves an angel.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“You astonish me!”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“And I shall astonish you more, perhaps. Three several times in one year</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">I wooed her, and three several times was my suit rejected by her.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“I say you astound me! Your suit rejected by Catherine! _Yours?_ Can</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">this be possible?”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Possible as that I was nearly driven to despair by her rejection.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Major Clifton threw his hand to his brow and gazed at the speaker in</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">amazement, while he compared the claims of General Conyers with his own.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">General Conyers, with his haughty and powerful connection in town and</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">country; his immense unincumbered estates; his high military rank; and</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">last, not least, his eminently handsome person, accomplished mind, and</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">graceful address;—General Conyers, in every social, official, and</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">personal dignity, highly superior. And himself, with his limited circle;</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">his debt-encumbered property; his medium post in the army; and his very</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">moderate share of personal attraction, and he exclaimed again—</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Catherine reject _you_?”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Three distinct times, most firmly.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Why, upon what possible pretext could she have done so?”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Ay, sure enough! Upon what possible pretext?” smiled General Conyers,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">ruefully. “Upon the plea that she did not love me, save only ‘as a</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">sister or a spirit might.’ I won her respect, esteem, friendship, all</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">but her love! She was a frank, high-minded, pure hearted girl. She gave</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">me the greatest proof of confidence she could possibly give, and at the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">same instant struck the only death-blow to dangerous hopes that she</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">could possibly strike, she told me that she could never be more than a</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">faithful friend to me, for that she loved another.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Major Clifton started, and grasped the arm of his companion, but</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">instantly recovering his self-control, he inquired, in a calm voice—</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“And who did she say was that other?”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Nay, she never breathed his name. She could not have done that. She was</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">trying to do me good when she informed me. I remember well her sweet and</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">holy looks and words. At first she flushed and paled, hesitating between</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">generous impulse and womanly reserve; and then as principle rose above</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">instinct, her face glowed with an expression such as I have seen in the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">pictures of St. Agnes;—a warm, high, holy look, an inspired look, such</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">as might well become the countenance of the Virgin Martyr, and she said,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">speaking to herself, ‘There is no good reason why I should not reveal</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">any secret of my heart, if the revelation can help any other soul to</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">tranquillity and strength.’ Then to me—‘Listen: You are not the only</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">sorely disappointed one. Who, indeed, is joyous that is past childhood?</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">I, too, have missed life’s crowning joy—the love of one I love. But what</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">then? If we cannot have joy in this life of probation, there yet remains</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">duty, and the peace its performance yields; and friends, and the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">cheerfulness their society gives; and God, and the divine comfort His</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">service brings.’”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“She said that? She said that?” groaned Clifton.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Yes. You seem strongly moved, Archer?”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“I am! I am! You do not know with how much reason! But go on! Tell me</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">more of her.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“She never breathed the name of him she loved to my ear, yet I knew her</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">whole secret. I had suspected it months before. Shall I tell you why?”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Yes! Go on!”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“It was at the Governor’s levee, where I was first introduced to her,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">and where you met after a long absence; I was present at the casual</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">meeting. I beheld the strong emotion that she could not conceal. Some</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">hours after that I was near her, when unobserved by all except myself,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">and unconscious of my presence also, she chanced to witness the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">reconciliation between yourself and your chosen bride. I saw her face</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">grow paler than death, and then the meek head bow in submission, and the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">meek hands fold as in prayer, and the meek voice murmur low and</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">fervently, ‘Thank God! Oh! God help me to say that sincerely.’ I had</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">been interested in her before; but I saw that, and I loved her from that</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">hour, the sweet, the lovely, the Madonna-like maiden! I loved her with</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">an affection as free from passion as it was from selfishness, and as</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">free from both as her own pure, saintly nature. And I offered her my</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">heart and hand, as I said. And she sweetly and gratefully declined them,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">as I might have known before;—unveiling the sanctuary of her priceless</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">heart, to quiet me forever with the revelation of another master there.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Oh, God! Oh, God!” said Clifton.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“What disturbs you so, Archer?”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Never mind. Never mind! And so, rejecting you as a lover, she won you</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">as a friend?”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“For life and death and eternity. Yes.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“That was a triumph! Rejected lovers seldom become friends! That was a</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">rare triumph! But then Catherine is a rare woman.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Very rare!”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Truly nick-named ‘Maria Theresa.’”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Catherine! ‘Maria Theresa?’ By whom? By some one, I suppose, who,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">recognizing her strong, practical mind, sees nothing better in her</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">nature—sees not the pure heart and the lofty spirit of infinitely higher</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">value than that.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Heaven bless you, Conyers, for your good opinion of Catherine. But I</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">wish to put a case to you, only an imaginary case, you observe,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Conyers?”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Yes! Well?”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Suppose you had married Catherine?”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“That is very imaginary! Well?”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“And suppose that you had discovered her to be unworthy of your good</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">opinion?”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Impossible! It could not have happened, because she could not have been</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">unworthy.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“But suppose that her unworthiness had been made manifest to you beyond</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">all chance of mistake or doubt?”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“D—n it! Don’t let me be profane. It _couldn’t_ have been made manifest</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">to me, I tell you! Could any person or anything demonstrate to me that</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">the sun darkened the earth, or the clouds dropped powdered charcoal, or</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">that fig trees bore thorns? There are some things that can’t be proved,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">because they can’t exist!”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Major Clifton thrust his hand in his bosom, and drew thence a letter in</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">a gray envelope, and handing it to General Conyers, asked—</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Do you know that hand-writing?”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Certainly, I do.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Whose is it?”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Mrs. Catherine Clifton’s.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Are you sure?”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Pooh! Of course I am! I am familiar with the writing!”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Could you swear to it?”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“You are very emphatic in this matter! Let me see the letter again. Yes,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">I could swear to it.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“And now will you do me the favor to read it?”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">General Conyers, with some hesitation, began to read, but before getting</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">half through, the blood rushed to his brow, and crushing the letter in</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">his hand, he hurled it beneath his feet, and setting his heel upon it,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">ground it into the earth.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“What do you think of it, now?” asked Clifton, bitterly.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Think of it!—it is an infernal forgery! If any man had brought me that</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">letter, and said that Catherine wrote it, I should have treated it just</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">as I have done now, to show my contempt for the forgery; and then I</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">should have raised it with my sword’s point, and thrust it down his</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">throat, to express my loathing of the forger or the accomplice.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“And yet, just now you could have sworn to the hand-writing.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Death! Yes! And for which presumption I earnestly beg your pardon,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Clifton!”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“And now you are quite as much convinced that she did not write it. How</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">can you explain this?”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Why, simply thus—that the whole of Catherine’s noble life is a</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">refutation of the slander contained in that letter. Sir, it is a d—d</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">forgery! Look at it! See how easy the hand is imitated! Give me a pen</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">and ink, and though I have not much talent for imitation, I will produce</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">you a fac simile of Catherine’s hand-writing. I repeat, I beg your</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">forgiveness for saying that that was Catherine’s. I said so, because it</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">strongly resembled hers, and I did not know the vile purport! Oh, I</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">trust, Clifton, that you signally punished the conspirator who wrote it!</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">I can well believe that you neither eat, slept, said your prayers, went</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">to church or into her presence, until you had pursued the forger, and</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">punished him or her to the utmost extent of the law!”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">They had now arrived at Greenwood, and Major Clifton, without replying,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">conducted his companion into the house, and introduced him to the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">planter’s family. On inquiry concerning the state of Catherine, he</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">learned that she still lay without any sign of life, except the faint</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">beating of her heart. Leaving General Conyers with his host, he went up</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">into his wife’s chamber. He wished to be alone with her. There is</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">something in a sound faith that always makes a strong impression. The</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">deep, thorough earnestness of confidence in Catherine’s perfect</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">integrity, exhibited by Conyers, had shaken Clifton’s firm convictions</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">of her guilt to their uprootings, as the whirlwind shakes the oak. Ay,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">and _he_ was shaken—literally shaken, terribly shaken, by strong</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">passion, as he exclaimed to himself—</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Oh, would to Heaven I could think as he does! I am no longer a youth,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">credulous of happiness, but if I could only thoroughly believe in Kate</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">as he does—or once see her innocence proved, it would fill my heart with</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">joy.” He entered the chamber, and went up to her bedside. There was a</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">pallor spread like death over her brow. “But she was always so pale,” he</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">said, in a voice tremulous with tenderness. So still she lay, so</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">profound was her repose, that her breathing could not be seen or heard,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">until, alarmed, he stooped and listened, and perceived that her</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">respiration was deep, soft, slow and regular. Her sleep was evidently</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">necessary, healthful and recuperative. He stood and gazed at her</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">sculptured, marble-like face, as her head reposed upon the pillow. He</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">had never seen that noble countenance in the deep repose of sleep</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">before. No, and waking, it had always been disturbed by care, or grief,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">or anxiety, or bashfulness. Now the noble face was in perfect rest. The</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">majesty of truth sat enthroned upon the fine, broad, open forehead, with</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">its eyebrows arched far apart, and more elevated, because the eyelids</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">were shut down, with their dark lashes lying long and still upon the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">pale cheeks. And the beauty of goodness lay folded in every curve of the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">lightly-closed and perfect lips. She looked a queen in repose—</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2"><span class="Apple-converted-space">                 </span>“A Queen of noble Nature’s crowning,”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">whom it were disloyalty to suspect, and treason to accuse. As he gazed,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">the earnest faith of Conyers came back with tenfold power to his soul.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">He more than half abjured his evil convictions, and a flood of</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">tenderness came over his heart. There was no one to see his weakness—not</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">even _her_—the sleeper. He went and closed the door, and returned and</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">kneeled by her side. He took her hand, and bowed his head over it. From</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">that trance-sleep there was no fear, because there was no possibility of</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">waking her yet. He kissed and pressed that hand with sorrowful</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">passion—murmuring—“For once—for this time, I will, _I will_ believe you</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">true, my own dear Catherine. My whole nature starves, it starves, and</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">withers, and dies for a perfect reconciliation, a perfect union with</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">you. Oh, for once, let soul and heart be satisfied—let me steel my mind</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">against the thought of evil, and fold you around with my love, and press</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">you to this still denied and hungering, perishing heart.” And he raised</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">her in his arms, and folded her to his bosom, pressing an ardent kiss</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">upon her lips. That passionate kiss sent an electric shock through all</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">her still life. A shuddering sigh shook her bosom; her lips parted in a</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">light, rosy smile; color dawned upon her cheeks, and light beamed on her</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">brow. Alarmed, and remembering the physician’s warning that a premature</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">awakening might be fatal, he cautiously laid her down again, and</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">anxiously watched her countenance. She did not awake; nor did the light</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">depart from her brow; nor the color from her cheeks; nor the smile from</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">her lips. “How she loves me. Her soul as well as her person is mine. How</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">she loves me, even in sleep—even in this trance-sleep, with all her</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">senses locked. How she loves me—my Kate! my own! my wife! How she loves</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">me—yet no more than I love her. Witness this worn frame of mine, that</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">sorrow, like years, has aged! My own—”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">A light step upon the stairs, and a rap at the door, and he hastened to</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">open it. It was the farmer’s little niece, Susannah, who came to say</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">that Captain Fairfax was in the parlor, waiting to see Major Clifton. He</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">turned back an instant, to arrange the coverlet, gave a last glance at</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">the beloved face, and then followed the child down stairs. The staircase</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">led directly down into the parlor, and as soon as he had reached it, he</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">saw Frank Fairfax, who immediately hastened to meet him, and—</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“My dear Frank!”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“My dearest Clifton!”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Were the words of affectionate greeting interchanged, as they shook</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">hands.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Well, and so you have been married these two years nearly, and I have</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">never had the opportunity of congratulating you till now! Well, better</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">late than never, though it is always a mere form to wish a man joy who</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">has an excess of it already! But, indeed, you have the jewel of the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">world! If you had only waited two years longer, until I had somewhat</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">recovered the despair of my own awful bereavement, I should have tried</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">to dispute the prize with you—not that I was in love with noble</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Catherine—I never was but once in love, and I never shall be again—but</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">that I think her just the most precious woman in the world. Nor am I</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">alone in that opinion. I have been in her neighborhood, looking for her,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">before I came down here to find you, and there I found that she was</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">deeply venerated by her people, and honored, sincerely honored, by all</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">the proud, county aristocrats. And General Ross, the gallant General</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Ross, ‘second only to Wellington himself——’ we had to see Admiral</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Cockburn about this exchange of prisoners, and met General Ross in his</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">company—I wish you had heard the brave and generous Ross speak of your</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">wife. As soon as he knew what we had come for, and recognized your name</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">and _hers_, he took Admiral Cockburn aside, and talked with him in the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">most emphatic manner, seeming to insist upon something—(and be it known</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">that General Ross exercises a considerable influence over Cockburn, and</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">has even restrained him from greater excesses in Washington than were</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">committed there, obliging him to spare private dwellings, etc.)—and then</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">they came back to where we stood, and the arrangement was effected. And</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">to General Ross’s admiration of Catherine’s character, and to his</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">generosity, I attribute the ease with which the business was completed.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">‘Sir,’ he said, at parting, ‘had your army at Bladensburg been composed</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">of men with spirits equal to that of this heroic woman, your city of</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Washington had not been taken.’ But, where is noble Catherine, now?”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“In a deep sleep, or rather a trance-sleep, superinduced by the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">excessive toil and fatigue she has lately gone through—”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“‘Like a warrior taking his rest!’”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“No—I wish you would not apply that line, great as it is, to _her_. She</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">is not heroic, which is masculine—my Kate—she is strong only through her</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">affections, and a very child in timidity at other times. But, my dear</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Frank, glad as I am to see you, I wish to know—you have not told me the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">‘business of vital importance,’ which Conyers says, made you his</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">companion in seeking me.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">The face of Captain Fairfax suddenly clouded over; he put his hand in</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">his bosom, and then hesitating, said—</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“You have seen in the papers the obituary notice of a dear friend?”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“No! Who is it? I have no very dear friend, out of this house, now—whom</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">do you mean?”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Mrs. Georgia Clifton is no more.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Major Clifton started back, and gazed at the speaker with an expression</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">of deep concern, exclaiming—</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“No! Impossible! How could that be? A woman in such fine health!”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Death is always possible; at all times, and to all persons.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“When, and where, and under what circumstances, did she die? I am very</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">sorry.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“She died a week since, at her house, in Richmond.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“I am very sorry. The cause of her death?”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“One of those virulent summer fevers prevalent in the city just at this</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">season. Her physicians think that hers was fatally aggravated by the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">life of excitement she had led, and by the friction of something that</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">preyed upon her mind.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Frank paused, and Major Clifton kept his eyes fixed with interest upon</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">his countenance. Frank sighed, and resumed—</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“A few days before her death, she sent for me. I went, and found her</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">laboring under great mental distress. She seemed half disposed to make</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">me a confidant; but after much painful hesitation, she reserved her</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">secret, whatever it may have been, and drew from beneath her pillow this</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">letter, which she gave me—exacting an oath, that after her death, and</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">not before—I would hand it to _you_ with the seal unbroken. She said</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">that the whole future happiness of yourself and your wife, was concerned</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">in your receiving it. And then, with many sighs and groans—for her eyes</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">seemed too dry for tears—she let me depart. I never saw her again. A few</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">days after that, I heard she was dead.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“The letter?”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Here it is. You seem very much agitated, Clifton!”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“With reason! Give it me!”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">And receiving the letter, Major Clifton hastened to the opposite end of</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">the room and began to read it. It was the confession of a guilty and</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">dying woman. She wrote, that on the borders of eternity there was no</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">false seeming, and no false shame—that all human feelings were lost in</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">remorse, in terror, and in awe. Then she confessed her mad and guilty</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">passion for himself, and all the crimes into which it had tempted her;</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">the slanders that had separated him and his cousin Carolyn—the forged</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">letter that had brought such bitter sorrow to himself and Catherine. All</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">was confessed and deplored. Finally she supplicated his forgiveness, as</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">_he_ hoped to be forgiven of God.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">The subtle self-love of a man can pardon much in a woman whose motive of</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">action is a strong passion for himself. Great as her wickedness had</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">been—great as the suffering it had caused him, he bore no malice to the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">dead Georgia. He even after a time resolved to cover her sin from all</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">eyes—to bury it in the grave with her. But merciful as he was in judging</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Georgia—he was stern enough in condemning himself for so readily</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">believing his innocent wife to be guilty. And he divided his broken</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">exclamations between severe self-upbraidings, and rejoicings at her full</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">acquittal—Frank watching him with curiosity and strong interest.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Oh! fool! fool! fool!”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“What is it, Clifton? Who’s a fool?”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Oh! fool! thrice sodden fool that I’ve been! Thank Heaven. Oh! thank</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Heaven!”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Thank Heaven that he’s a thrice sodden fool! That’s new cause for</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">thanksgiving! What’s it all about, Archer?”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Oh! folly! blindness! madness! Heaven be praised! Oh! Heaven be</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">praised!”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Heaven be praised for folly, blindness, and madness! Well, Heaven be</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">praised for all things! But what the deuce is it, Clifton?”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Mole! mole! Oh, God, how grateful—how rejoiced I am!”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Oh, Lord, how grateful and rejoiced he is, that he’s a mole!</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Clifton!—What the mischief! Don’t keep on striding about, talking to</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">yourself, with your hand clapped to your forehead, like a walking</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">gentleman in a melo-drama, which you always detested! Besides, you know</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">there is no legitimate dramatic reason for a married hero to stride</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">about and obstreperate, excepting only jealousy, and you’re not jealous?</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Come! cease starting and vociferating, and tell me the cause—‘the CAUSE,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">my soul!’”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Frank! I’ve been a fool!”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“That’s no news.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“And a brute!”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Who doesn’t know that?”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“And a cursed villain.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Nay, ‘I wouldn’t hear your enemy say that.’”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Oh! Frank, Frank, what shall I do?”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“I am sure I don’t know, unless you tell me the premises of action.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“I cannot, Frank! Dear Frank, I cannot. The memory of the dead should be</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">sacred; so should the differences of——I cannot tell you, Frank.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Hist! Here’s the doctor.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Old Doctor Shaw at this moment passed through the parlor, on his way to</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">visit his patient.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Major Clifton accompanied him up stairs to her chamber.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">When they reached her bed-chamber, he noticed that the smile had</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">departed from her lips, and the color from her cheeks. The old physician</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">put on his spectacles, and looked scrutinizingly at her face and hands,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">laid his hand upon her forehead and bosom, to get the temperature, felt</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">her pulse, felt her hands and feet, and finally pronounced her to be</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">doing very well.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“May she not be wakened up, sir?” asked Clifton, almost selfish in his</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">impatience for a reconciliation.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“By no means. She must be let alone—nature is her best physician, and</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">the sleep she prescribes, her best medicine.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“But, sir, I have something of vital importance to communicate to her!”</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">persisted Clifton.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Sir, it may be of vital importance to _you_, but it would be of fatal</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">importance to _her_, should you rouse her to communicate it, whatever it</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">is.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Major Clifton was obliged to restrain his eagerness. The physician</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">departed, leaving only one simple direction:—that as soon as she awoke</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">she should be put in a warm bath.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Archer Clifton was then summoned down stairs to join the family at</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">supper. There he found a lively, witty, eccentric personage, who was</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">introduced to him as “Our neighbor, Mr. Perry.” And when the evening was</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">over, this gentleman took an opportunity of drawing the officers aside,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">and confidentially informing them that the ladies of Greenwood were very</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">much crowded with the company of some relations that were staying with</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">them just then, and that although they would certainly press their</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">guests to remain all night, the latter could not do so without putting</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">their kind hostess to much inconvenience; he concluded by offering, and</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">heartily pressing upon the gentlemen the accommodations of his own</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">house. Thanking Mr. Perry for his kindness, they accepted his proffered</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">hospitality, and prepared to accompany him home.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Major Clifton went up stairs, intending only to press a parting kiss</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">upon the lips of his now doubly beloved Catherine, but when he reached</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">her chamber, he seemed to forget every thing but her, and sat down by</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">her bedside, watching the sweet, pale, majestic countenance in its</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">death-like repose.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Ay! gaze on, Archer Clifton, for when you have once turned your eyes</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">away, sharp heart-pangs must be yours ere you look upon that sculptured</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">face again!</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">He remained until summoned by Mr. Perry—then pressing a fond kiss upon</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">the calmed lips, he departed with a tacit promise to be at her side</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">early in the morning.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">In the morning!</span></p>

<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">The confidential communication made by Mr. Perry, was probably a ruse on</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">the part of that eccentric gentleman, for the purpose of obtaining the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">assistance of the officers in “making a night of it” over at his house.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Certainly, on reaching the home of their host, they found company</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">awaiting their arrival, and they passed the evening in the jolly</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">festivity of country hospitality. A luxurious supper was served late at</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">night, from which they did not separate until the “small hours.” Thus</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">many of the guests overslept themselves the next morning, which delayed</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">the family breakfast several hours. Therefore it was after ten o’clock,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">before Major Clifton, very much against the will of his odd entertainer,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">bid him farewell, and set out to return to Greenwood. It was eleven</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">o’clock when he reached the farm-house. The ladies were all in their</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">sitting-room, engaged in their various domestic occupations of netting,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">sewing, knitting, etc., when he entered, and gave them the morning</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">salutation And then—</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“How is Mrs. Clifton this morning, ladies? Can I see her immediately?”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Mrs. Clifton, sir!” said the eldest lady, looking up in surprise. “Mrs.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Clifton is gone sir. Did you not know it?”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Gone?” repeated Archer Clifton, incredulously.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Yes, sir.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“_Gone!_” he reiterated, in amazement.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Yes, sir. We certainly thought that you were aware of her departure.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Most certainly not! _Gone!_ When? how? excuse me, madam, but where has</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">she gone?”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“We do not know, sir, indeed, since you cannot tell us. We thought that</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">she had gone to join you, at Mr. Perry’s. We were very sorry, but—”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“How long since she left? How did she go? Pardon my vehemence, dear</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">madam.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“We partake of your anxiety, sir. Mrs. Clifton left us about four hours</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">since, at seven o’clock, immediately after breakfast. She went away on</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">the horse that was brought here yesterday as her own. She left us very</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">much against our arguments and persuasions. We would gladly have</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">detained her.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Gone! Good Heavens, was she _able_ to go.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“No, sir, assuredly she was not.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Archer Clifton sank into a chair, exclaiming—</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Pray, tell me, dear madam, the circumstances of this departure, and all</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">that occurred from the time I left, until she went away.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Why, sir, after you left, she continued in the same deep sleep until</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">nearly nine o’clock, when she began to show symptoms of awakening. I</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">sent out and ordered the hot bath to be prepared, and sat down to watch</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">her. As she drew near to consciousness, her face lost that look of</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">profound repose, which had previously marked it, and began to assume an</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">expression of suffering. Her brows folded, and her lips sprang apart and</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">quivered, as with a spasm of sharp pain, and her eyes flared open</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">suddenly, and she was awake. I asked her how she felt, but she shook her</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">head, and closed her eyes again, and shut her teeth tightly, like one</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">trying to bear silently some sharp, inward pain. The bath was then</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">prepared by the bedside, and we began to get her ready for it; but on</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">the slightest attempt to move her, she groaned so deeply, that we</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">scarcely dared to lift her for some minutes. I knew then how it</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">was;—that her muscles were stiff and painful, from the severe exertion</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">of such a long equestrian journey. And I knew also that the hot bath</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">would relieve her; and the doctor’s directions had been peremptory, so</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">we tried again, and placed her in the bath. And very soon the hot water</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">seemed to alleviate her sufferings. And when we put her comfortably to</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">bed again, she thanked us very sweetly. I asked her how she found</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">herself. She answered, ‘Better’—adding, that she thought, by her hard</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">exercise, she had hurt some part of her chest or side, which had given</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">her great pain, but which was now partially relieved.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Did she seem very much better? Was her voice strong in speaking?”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“No, it was very weak and faint, and frequently broken, as by some</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">inward pain, as I said.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Go on, dear lady.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“We brought her a cup of tea and a plate of toast, of both of which she</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">partook slightly. It was then after nine o’clock, and she begged that</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">she might not disturb us—that we would retire to bed—and said that she</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">was better, and would try to sleep again. She then composed herself to</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">rest, and the girls all left the room. I remained watching until I</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">thought she slept, and then I lay down to rest on the other bed in the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">same room. I think she passed a good night, for I could not divest</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">myself of uneasiness upon her account, and so I could not get to sleep</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">until after midnight, and during all that time I never heard her move,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">or sigh. After I did get to sleep, however, I slept very soundly, till</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">near six o’clock. And when I awoke, what was my surprise, to see her up</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">and dressed, as for a journey. She looked very pale and ill and</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">sorrowful, and in fastening her habit, she frequently stopped and leaned</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">against the bed-post for support. I arose quickly and questioned her</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">wishes, and begged her to lie down again. But she only waved her hand</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">against me, with a mute, imploring gesture. I expostulated with her, but</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">arguments and persuasions were alike in vain—she only answered, ‘I must</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">go.’”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Oh, Heaven! Where, where did she wish to go?”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“We do not know. She was not communicative, and we did not like to</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">question her.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Forgive me, dear madam. Indeed I fear my questionings must appear</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">almost rude, but my great anxiety must be my excuse.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Your anxiety is very natural, sir, and we share it.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Did she know that I was in the neighborhood? Did any one inform her?”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“We cannot tell whether she knew of your presence here. We did not tell</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">her, for, as I said, she made no inquiries, and there was a reserve</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">about her despair that shut itself in from all interference. Indeed it</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">would be scarcely doing justice to her look of deep sorrow, to say that</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">she was the most hopeless looking human being I ever saw in my life. She</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">seemed like one who had seen her last hope go down.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Merciful God!”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“We used every method, except force, to prevent her leaving us, though</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">we were impressed with the idea that she was going to you. And after her</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">departure, in consulting together, we were half sorry that we had not</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">essayed gentle coercion, for we all suspected that the lady’s reason was</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">clouded.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Great God! I have driven her to madness—perhaps to death!” thought</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Archer Clifton, but then he exerted self-control enough to conceal the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">depths and extent of his anxiety, and asked, “What road did she take?”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“The North-west road, sir, which branches off towards Mr. Perry’s a</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">quarter of a mile up, which was one of our reasons for supposing that</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">she had gone to join you.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Taking a hasty leave of the family, Major Clifton remounted his horse,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">and rode furiously up the road, meeting General Conyers and Frank, who</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">had lagged behind on their return home. Stopping them, he communicated</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">what had happened, but concealed his worst fears, and merely said that</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">he presumed that Catherine had left for her Virginia home, in ignorance</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">of his liberation, and his presence in the neighborhood, and that he</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">wished, if possible, to overtake her, before she had proceeded far upon</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">her road. Frank immediately turned rein to accompany him, while General</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Conyers, with many expressions of regret and concern, took leave of</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">them, to return to Greenwood, and explain their absence.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">The road lay for many miles through a dense forest, and they galloped</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">onward for hours without meeting a single traveler or seeing a solitary</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">house. Near the outskirts of the forest they came upon a party of</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">stragglers, whom they judged to be deserters from the British army. But</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">these men, when questioned, gave cautious and unsatisfactory</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">answers—sulkily insisting that no lady riding alone had passed that way.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">They next inquired of some field laborers, who were stacking grain a</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">little farther on. They replied that a lady in a dark riding-dress,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">riding on a bay horse, and a boy, mounted on a white mare, attended her.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Perhaps this was Catherine, and her attendant some chance passenger.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">They questioned more particularly, and the description given answered to</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">her personal appearance. They asked what road she had taken, and being</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">told “straight ahead,” they set off in a gallop. A few miles further on</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">they again inquired, and were told that such a lady, attended by a boy,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">had passed about an hour before. Full of hope, they put spurs to their</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">horses and hurried on, congratulating themselves that they were gaining</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">on her so fast.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">At length they reached a school-house in the woods, where, tied to a</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">fence, they saw the bay horse, with a side-saddle, and a white pony,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">with a boy’s saddle. Dismounting quickly, Captain Fairfax hastened to</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">the school-room door, and inquired of the master to whom the animal</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">belonged?</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“To Mrs. Jones, who has just brought her son to school,” answered the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">teacher, full of surprise at the question.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">And there, indeed, sat “Mrs. Jones” and young Hopeful, looking as if</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">they considered such investigation into their property very impertinent,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">to say the least.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Disappointed, Frank returned to Major Clifton with this explanation, and</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">they looked at each other in chagrin and perplexity—Major Clifton with</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">great difficulty maintaining his self-possession, and concealing the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">dreadful forebodings that overshadowed his mind. They were now thirty</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">miles from Greenwood, and the sun was getting low.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“I do not see anything better to do, Archer, than to keep on till we</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">reach Washington City. No doubt you will see her there, if you do not</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">overtake her before.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Again putting whip to their horses, they galloped on, passing the great</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">belt of forest, and entering upon the bare lowlands, lying south of the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">city. It was late in the night when they descended the road leading to</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">the Anacostic bridge. They found that the bridge had been destroyed, and</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">they experienced much difficulty and delay before finding a boat to take</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">them across. They entered the ruined and blackened city a little after</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">midnight. At that hour little opportunity of search was afforded, and</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">that little was fruitless. They had much trouble in finding a night’s</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">lodging in the desolate city, but at length obtained indifferent</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">shelter, and retired, with the determination to pursue their</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">investigations in the morning. At an early hour they arose, and went</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">out, making inquiries in every direction, but in vain. No one had seen</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">or heard of the missing lady though many cheerfully suggested that she</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">had fallen into the hands of the British soldiery, who were on their</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">retreat through the low counties. Strongly impressed with the idea that</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">she must be in or near Washington, they were unwilling to abandon their</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">search, but remained in the city all day, and through the next night,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">before resigning all hope of finding her there. Even upon the second</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">morning, Major Clifton and Captain Fairfax were divided in their opinion</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">as to whether they had better go back to St. Mary’s, or go on to R——.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Major Clifton, full of the darkest presentiments, was disposed to turn</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">back. Captain Fairfax, on the contrary, full of hope and confidence,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">urged his friend to push forward. While they were debating, General</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Conyers rode up and joined them. He said he had but that morning reached</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">the city, and had been an hour in search of them. In answer to their</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">anxious questions, General Conyers informed them that up to late the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">night before, no news had been heard of Mrs. Clifton—that she evidently</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">was not in the neighborhood he had just left. He seemed grieved and</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">alarmed to find that they had not yet overtaken Catherine, but expressed</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">a strong conviction that she must be on her way home. He advised them to</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">pursue the journey, and regretting that peremptory duty called him to an</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">interview with the Secretary of War, and prevented his bearing them</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">company, took leave, and rode away—turning back once to beg that as soon</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">as they had found Catherine, they would write to him at Washington, and</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">let him know. Major Clifton and Frank procured fresh horses, and leaving</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">their own, set forward on their anxious journey.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">The gloomiest forebodings darkened the mind of Archer Clifton. There was</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">one scene ever present to his mental vision—where, at the end of her</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">dreadful journey, fainting from incredible exertion, Catherine had</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">fallen into his arms, and he had received her with a harsh and stern</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">rebuke for making a scene:—one look and tone of hers, that filled his</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">soul with remorse and terror prophetic of doom—her last despairing</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">gaze—her last despairing tones, before she sank into insensibility. How</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">plaintively they echoed through his heart——“Patience, patience,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">patience——Indeed I will not trouble you, love——I will go away——Maybe God</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">will let me die.” Would he ever forget those words, that voice, that</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">gaze of unutterable but meek despair!</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“I have broken her heart. I have killed her. I have killed her. Woman’s</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">nature could not live through what I have driven _her_ through! _Poor,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">poor girl!_—so bitterly slandered!—so cruelly tortured! Persecuted unto</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">death—or worse—unto madness! And where is she now? Perhaps the waves of</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">the Patuxent roll over her cold bosom—calmed at last; or perhaps she</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">lives—a mad and houseless wanderer; but I will not believe this, I will</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">not believe it! She may be dead; she must be broken-hearted, but not</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">mad! All-Merciful God!—not mad! She may be dead—and that would be just,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">for it would secure her happiness and my own retribution, in the only</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">way that both could be secured, perhaps.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Not a hint of this prophetic despair was breathed to Fairfax. Clifton’s</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">indomitable pride, regnant even over this anxiety, forbade the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">communication of his remorse and alarm, and the great reason he had for</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">both. Yet Frank observed and tried to cheer his friend’s deep gloom.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Come, rouse yourself, Archer, we are nearing L——, and shall be at White</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Cliffs by night-fall, and who, but Mrs. Clifton will meet us at the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">door, with her gentle smile and gentle welcome, and then shall we not</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">all spend a jolly evening, laughing over our cups of tea at the famous</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">wild-goose chase we have had?” But little effect had Frank’s words on</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">his drooping fellow traveler. Only as they drew near White Cliffs his</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">depression rose into feverish excitement. Arrived at L——, they inquired</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">if Mrs. Clifton had passed through there, and were informed that she had</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">not. It was long after night-fall that they reached White Cliffs. Here</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">the terrified house servants, roused up from their sleep, answered to</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">all inquiries upon the subject, that they had not seen or heard from</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">their mistress since she left to go to Washington. Henny pushed foremost</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">of all to inquire about her “dear mist’ess and brother Jack.” But with a</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">gesture of desperation, Major Clifton sent her off unsatisfied, and</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">turned an agonized look upon Frank. Fairfax was almost discouraged, but,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">nevertheless, he answered that silent appeal hopefully, saying, “Oh!</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">doubtless she will be home to-morrow, or the next day, at farthest. We</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">ought to have remembered that she had not recovered from her fatigue,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">and that she would probably take her own time in returning. We have</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">outridden her, evidently.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Major Clifton rejoined by a groan. He ordered refreshments for his</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">guest, and soon after attended him to his room, and retired to his own,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">not to rest, but to walk about distractedly, and then he burst into</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Catherine’s vacant chamber, and threw himself down upon her empty bed,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">in the very anguish of bereavement. His long residence in the lowlands</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">of the Chesapeake, during the hot summer months, had pre-disposed him to</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">illness. His long journey, under the burning sun of August by day, and</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">heavy dews of August by night, fatigue and anxiety, loss of food and</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">sleep, all conspired to bring on the pernicious fever, and before</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">morning Archer Clifton was tossing and raving in high delirium. Summoned</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">by the alarmed servants, Captain Fairfax was early at his bedside, and</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">seeing his condition, dispatched a messenger for the family physician.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">For many days, his state alternated between delirium and stupor, and his</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">life tottered upon the edge of the grave. And in his delirium all his</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">raving was of Catherine—still Catherine—now adjuring her as his</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Nemesis—now wooing her by the most tender epithets of affection—calling</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">her his “poor wounded dove,” his “broken-hearted child,” etc. Often, he</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">repeated plaintively her last sorrowful, hopeless words.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">At length the crisis of the disease came. The delirium arose to a</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">frenzy. His spirit, as well as his flesh, seemed to be passing through</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">the very fires of purgatory. He raved incessantly—now of Carolyn, now of</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Georgia, then of his mother, and always of Catherine—sometimes calling</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">down the bitterest imprecations upon his own head, sometimes severely</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">reproaching Georgia, sometimes pleading his cause with his mother, and</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">always breaking off to soothe and coax Catherine, as if she were circled</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">in his arm.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">At length the frenzy fairly exhausted itself, and he sank into a</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">comatose state, to dream of Catherine, to see visions of Catherine, to</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">feel her gentle presence, and healing ministrations all about him. Then</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">came insensibility, which lasted he did not know how long, for all sense</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">of time and place and existence itself was blotted out.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">And at last he awoke—the burning fever had gone out from his blood, and</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">a delicious coolness ran through all his veins—the terrible nervous</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">excitement had subsided, and a luxurious calm lay upon mind and body,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">until memory came to disturb it, perhaps to torture it. He was</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">experiencing the delightful sensations of restoration and convalescence,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">and his physical state alone would have been a sufficient cause for</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">happiness, but for one aching, aching spot, one sharp point of agony as</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">it were in his heart’s core. And when the cry in his bosom found its</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">corresponding expression, the word was “Catherine!” “Catherine!”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">His eyes had opened on his darkened chamber, where, upon the hearth,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">glimmered a feeble taper, that scarcely sent its weak rays beyond the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">edges of the hearth. He knew it must be near day, for the low, melodious</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">detonating sounds of early morning were echoing through the mountains.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">The chamber seemed deserted—not if Catherine had been living would his</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">sick bed have been so abandoned, he thought. He turned and groaned from</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">the depths of his bosom—“Oh, Catherine! Catherine.” His room was very</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">dusky—he could not see the presence by his couch—but now gentler than</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“tired eyelids upon tired eyes” fell a soft hand upon his brow.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Surely there was but one touch like that in the world!</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">A new born, feeble hope was trembling at his heart, a hope that he</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">feared to disturb lest it should die in disappointment; that he dared</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">scarcely submit to the test of certainty, lest that certainty should</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">bring not joy but despair. At last, trembling with doubt, he murmured,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Am I dreaming, or, dear Kate, are you here?”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“I am here,” she answered softly.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Darling, are you well?”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Very well—but _you_ are not well enough to talk yet,” said Kate,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">gently.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Dear Kate—how long have you been home?”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Since the day you were taken ill,” replied Kate, at the same time</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">encircling his shoulders with one arm, and raising him, while with the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">other hand she placed a glass to his lips.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Whether the medicine were a potent sedative, or whether her gentler</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">touch had a soothing effect, or whether both these influences acted upon</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">him, I cannot tell; but certainly the nervous excitement, just raised by</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">the discovery of her presence, subsided into perfect calmness, and he</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">lay with his hand folded in Catherine’s, until he fell asleep.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">When he awoke again it was sunrise, and his room looked cheerful, and</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">the family physician and Frank Fairfax stood at his bedside, with their</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">congratulations on his convalescence. And while they staid, his eyes</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">were roving restlessly around the room, in search of some one else.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">And when they went away, Catherine entered, bringing cold water, and</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">came and sponged his head and hands. And then she went out, and returned</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">with his light breakfast. She sat upon the bed, supporting his head and</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">shoulders upon her bosom while he ate. At last—</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Take it all away, dearest Kate,” he said, “and sit where I can see you.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">It is you who are my restorative.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">When the service was removed, and his pillows were arranged, and he was</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">comfortably laid back upon them again, he said—</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Dearest Kate, do you know that I know at last, how deeply you have been</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">injured?”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">She stooped down to him saying, softly—</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Please do not try to talk to-day. Yield to the inclination you have for</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">sleep. It is so needful to you, and will prove so restorative. And</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">to-morrow, when you are better, we can converse.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">He smiled upon her, and laid his hand in hers, and while she clasped it,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">fell asleep.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">With a strong constitution like that of Archer Clifton, the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">convalescence is rapid. And Catherine’s presence, as he said, was his</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">true restorative.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">The fourth morning from this, he was very much better, and reclined</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">comfortably upon his couch watching Catherine, who moved quietly about</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">the room setting things in order. He was much wasted by illness, and his</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">face looked still more sallow and haggard for the dark, dishevelled hair</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">and whiskers that encircled it; but his countenance wore an expression</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">of subdued joy as he lay and watched Kate. At last—</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Are you so much afraid that Henny will disturb me by rattling a cup and</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">saucer, or jingling a teaspoon, that you must do all yourself? My</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">devoted Kate, I am not so ill. Come and sit upon the lounge by me, and</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">let me talk to you,” he said, holding out his arms.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">She went and sat upon the side of the couch, and he encircled her with</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">his arm, while he said—</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“My dear Kate, do you know that I thought I had lost you?”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">She raised her eyes in gentle wonder.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Yes, I thought your great and undeserved misfortunes had killed or</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">maddened you.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“It was the approach of your illness that gave you such dreadful</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">thoughts,” said Catherine, gently.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Not entirely, dear Kate. It was your last words when you fainted on my</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">bosom—do you remember them?”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“No—I remember nothing very distinctly from the moment I threw myself in</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">among the soldiery, and saw the bayonets glittering around me, until I</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">awoke and found myself in the farmer’s house.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Ah! don’t you remember that in answer to my harsh question—harsh Kate,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">because I was still in blindness—you answered—‘Patience, patience,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">patience; indeed I will not trouble you, love—I will go away; maybe God</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">will let me die.’”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Did I really use those words?”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Yes, and with such a look of hopeless resignation! I thought that I had</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">lost you, Kate. I thought that you were dead or mad, or at least had</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">been driven from me, for you said so earnestly, ‘I will go away?.’”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Did I say that? I do not remember. But I suppose I meant that I would</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">go home. And, oh! do you think—</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Think what, dear Kate?”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">She paused, and her face flushed. She had been about to say, “Do you</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">think that anything but your own will would have driven me from you?”</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">But her old shyness returned upon her stronger than ever.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">He understood her, and told her so by the tightening pressure of his</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">arm.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“And, dear Kate, we could hear of you nowhere. You were long in</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">returning, Catherine.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Yes, when I started I was still very unequal to the return journey, I</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">had weakened myself, and was obliged to ride slowly. And then I lost my</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">way coming back—that was how you missed me.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“And does my Kate know that I know now how deeply she has been wronged,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">and how nobly she has borne those wrongs—returning always good for evil.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">And can she guess the remorse and sorrow of heart that hurried on this</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">fit of illness?” Then suddenly overcome with emotion, he exclaimed: “Oh,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">my God, Catherine! can you imagine how I suffered?”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Yes, yes, indeed I know it all! I learned all—all—in the raving of your</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">delirium. Others thought it _mere_ raving but I knew.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“And do you know who forged that fatal letter, Kate?”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Yes.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Who was it, then?”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“You said, Mrs. Georgia.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Yes. It was strange you never suspected that, Kate.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“I did suspect it.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“You did suspect it!” exclaimed Archer Clifton, in surprise.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Yes.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“And you never breathed that suspicion!”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“No, because I had no certain evidence against her. It would have been</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">wrong to have acted upon a mere suspicion.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Just and upright in all things!”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“I only believed God’s promises. I left my cause to Heaven.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“And Heaven has vindicated you, my Kate! You have seen my sufferings</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">since discovering how unjustly you had been condemned; but, oh, Kate, I</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">suffered also when I madly believed you guilty.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“I know you did. I do know you did. It was that that gave point to my</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">own sorrow.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“When I cast you into the fire, while you were tortured, _I_ was</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">scathed! I loved you too perfectly not to suffer with you. You were too</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">really a portion of myself, for me not to suffer through you. I am</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">thinking of that Archbishop, Kate—whose name I have forgotten—”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Cranmer?”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Yes, Cranmer! See how our very unspoken thoughts rush together, dear</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">wife. Yes, Kate, I was thinking of Cranmer, who thrust his offending</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">hand into the flames, and held it there, until it burned to cinders, and</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">dropped off. Oh, my Kate! was it his hand alone that suffered, or did</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">not his whole body agonize with it? And so, my Catherine, when believing</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">you unworthy, I thrust you into the fire, did I not suffer through you</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">in all my nature? I did! I did, Catherine! Lift up the hair from my</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">temples, and tell me what you see?”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Kate lifted the clustering dark curls, and answered—</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“A few white hairs.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“_The tears I made you shed, bleached them, Kate._”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">She did not reply, except by meeting his gaze with a look of earnest</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">affection.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">He resumed—</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Yes—even then, when insanely I believed it possible for you to be</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">guilty—even _then_—every look of anguish on your brow wrung my</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">bosom—every tear you dropped, fell hot upon my heart. Stoop down. Let me</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">tell you one little simple thing—I sometimes saw—oh, I used to watch you</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">so closely, because I could not help it, Kate;—when I was harsh and</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">stern, I sometimes saw your chin quiver—like a grieved child’s—and,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Kate, my whole soul would be overflowed with tenderness, which, to</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">conceal, I had to start up and leave the room, with every appearance of</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">anger that I could falsely assume.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Kate wept—her tears fell fast upon his hand, that she had clasped</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">between her own.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“And, oh, Catherine, to think that all this trouble I have suffered, and</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">have inflicted upon you, should have been so unnecessary!”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Catherine slid from the edge of the couch down upon her knees beside it,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">and her countenance grew earnest, and inspired with faith and love, as</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">she clasped her hands, and said—</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Oh, no! it was _not_ unnecessary. God suffered it to be, and it was</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">well—_very_ well! ‘All things work together for good, to them that love</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">the Lord.’ And every pang that has ploughed our hearts in the past, will</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">make them fruitful of good in the future. One fruit is, that the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">suffering of the last two years has drawn our hearts together as nothing</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">else could have done. Because—”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Again in the full tide of her earnest thoughts, the old bashfulness</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">flushed her cheek, and silenced her tongue. She wished to say, “Because</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">I think you would never have known me so well, or held me so dear, if</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">you had not proved me by fiery trial.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">And again his heart rightly interpreted her silence, and he answered her</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">unuttered thought by saying—</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Yes, you are right, my own dear blessing! You are right, for I never</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">should have known your full value but for the trial you have passed</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">through. Yet not now only, but always have I loved you, dear wife. I</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">denied it to myself—I denied it to others—but there it was, the perfect,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">vital love, as sure as fate. When I first saw you, Kate, I met in your</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">face, your voice, your manner,—yes, in every look and tone and gesture,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">in your whole unity—something that I had vainly sought through</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">life—something homogenial to my nature—something perfectly satisfying.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">You seemed, dear Kate, not so much a separate existence as the</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">completion of my own. What did you say, Kate? Your voice, too, is ‘ever</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">soft, gentle and low,’—but speak again dearest. It is something that my</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">heart listens to hear.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“I said that I, too, when we first met,” she hesitated, and her cheek</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">crimsoned, but feeling that he listened breathless for her words, she</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">continued,—“Well, only this: I felt as if I were wholly yours, Archer—I</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">have felt so ever since.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Again she paused from native bashfulness.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Kiss me, Kate,—you never kissed me in your life.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Blushing and timid as the girl that she was, she stooped and lightly</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">touched his lips with hers. But laughing fondly he threw his arm around</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">her, exclaiming—</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“You child! you child! Married two years and cannot kiss me!” and</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">pressed her to his bosom, for one instant, in a passionate embrace, that</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">sent life and gladness through all her veins, and then he said, “I am</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">not ill, Catherine. I have drawn health from your lips. See who is at</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">the door, love.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Kate went and admitted Frank, who came in accoutred for traveling.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Ha! where now, Fairfax?” asked Clifton.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“For Richmond to-day.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“No! You will not leave us so soon?”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Yes,—the truth is, I _must_. I have an engagement to fulfill there on</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Thursday.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“An engagement! Of what nature, Frank, if a friend may ask?”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Why, the fact is,” said Captain Fairfax, growing very red in the face,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">with the effort of pulling on a pair of gloves, “I am going to be</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">married.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Married! Oh, Frank! and not to tell us anything about it till now.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Hem! There was no proper opportunity till now,” stammered the young</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">man.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Well, who is the lady, Frank?” asked Clifton, while Catherine looked</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">and listened with interest.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“The only friend that my dear Zuleime found in all her adversity—Mrs.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Knight,” said Frank, and then he added, quickly, “It was a long time</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">before my mother’s pride could be reconciled to this, but Ida’s genuine</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">goodness won her at last.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">After the first involuntary expression of surprise, Catherine and</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Clifton exchanged glances, and Catherine said,</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Well, Captain Fairfax, as soon after the marriage as</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">convenient,—instantly after the ceremony, if you please,—you must bring</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">your bride down, and pass some weeks with us.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“I thank you, Mrs. Clifton; I profoundly thank you, but we are going</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">immediately to England. Ida pines to see her father, who is a country</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">curate, in Devonshire. She has never been reconciled with him since her</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">first unfortunate marriage. I have promised to take her to him, and so</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">immediately after the ceremony, we four—that is, Ida, myself and our two</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">little girls—are going to embark for Liverpool.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Well, altogether, this has put a surprise upon us, Frank,” said Major</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Clifton, meditatively running his fingers through his hair; “but, when</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">you return you will make us a visit. By the way, how long do you intend</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">to be absent?”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Until the spring. And now I must really bid you good-bye, regretting</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">very much that I cannot carry you both along with me.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">They shook hands cordially, Clifton saying—</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Well, Frank, our very best wishes attend you. May you have much</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">happiness!”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Captain Fairfax turned to take leave of Catherine, but she said that she</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">would attend him down. She left the room with him. And when the door</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">shut behind them, Clifton clasped his hands upon his brow and closed his</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">eyes, as in deep thought or prayer. When Kate re-entered the room</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">softly, he said—</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Come hither, Catherine!”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">And she came and knelt by his side, and he encircled her with his arm,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">and drew her face down to his bosom, and raising his eyes toward Heaven,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">said—</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“‘A wife is from the Lord!’ Even so, oh, God! How shall I thank Thee?</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Hear me consecrate my whole future life to Thy service, in</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">acknowledgment of this, Thy gift.”</span></p>

<p class="p3"><span class="s2">reading matter. No library is either attractive or complete without a</span></p>
