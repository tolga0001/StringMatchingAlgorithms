PREFACE.


Of the period of which this book treats, there have been political
histories, and scurrilous books written anent the Royal Family, _ad
nauseam_: and the Diaries which have been published, bearing on this
time, deal only with the acts, and sayings, of the higher
classes--leaving the life of the vastly greater proportion of the
population--the middle classes--untouched. No better source of
information as to their mode of living, their amusements, the tattle,
and passing follies of the times, can possibly be found, than in the
Newspapers of the day; and I selected the commencement of the _Times_,
1 Jan. 1788, as the starting point of a picture of the Social Life at
the end of the Eighteenth Century.

The copies of the _Times_, however, are very imperfect,--nay, in some
years, totally missing--until 1793-1794--from which date they are
perfect; so that, when anything noteworthy occurred, I have drawn from
another source; and, to establish the undoubted authenticity of each
quotation, I have given the title of the Newspaper, with its date. The
daily Newspapers of those times were totally different to those to
which we are accustomed. The absence of Railways, Steamships, and
Electric Telegraphs, combined with a very high rate of Postage,
prevented the publication of all News, either from foreign or
provincial sources, except it were of real importance; and, as the
daily sheets must be filled, it followed, as a matter of course, that
a substitute was found in detailing the social life of the
Metropolis--and the daily Newspapers, which now give us the latest
news from all parts of the globe--had to be filled with social
paragraphs, anecdotal, satirical, or otherwise. They were as open to
correction, or contradiction, then, as now; so that we may put trust
in them; and when these paragraphs are collected, and somewhat
classified, they afford a view of the daily life of the period, such
as is utterly unattainable elsewhere. This collection must, of
necessity, be valuable to the student of those times, besides being of
great interest to the general reader.

The difficulty of obtaining contemporary illustrations, fitted for
this work, from books, or pictures, has compelled me to draw freely on
the satirical prints of the period--which are abundant, and perfectly
well suited to the purpose, if the reader will only bear in mind, that
they are sometimes a little exaggerated. Still, on the whole, they so
truthfully represent the manners, costume, &c., of the age, that they
could not be omitted; and that they are faithful reproductions of the
originals, I can guarantee, for I drew them all myself.

                                                  JOHN ASHTON.

OLD TIMES.


Although this book does not pretend to be a history of the times of
which it treats, still, it will materially help the reader, if, at the
outset, some of the principal events which occurred during the period
are succinctly narrated.

We start with the year 1788--and one of the first items of importance
is the founding of the colony of New South Wales; for Captain
Phillips, on 28th January, landed the first batch of convicts,
consisting of 561 men, 192 women, and 18 children, also a military
force of 212 men. As soon as they were all on shore, Phillips ordered
the King's Commission to be read, and assumed the office of Governor.
Such was the modest foundation of our great Australian Empire. On the
same day at home, Lord George Gordon, of Protestant rioting memory,
was brought before the judges of the King's Bench, to receive sentence
on two libels, one against the Queen of France, and another on the
criminal justice of the country. His sentence for the former, was
three years' imprisonment, for the latter, two years, to pay a fine of
£500, and find security for his good behaviour for fourteen years. He
fled to Holland, was arrested, brought back, and lodged in Newgate. He
did not live to regain his liberty, but death set him free 1st
November 1793.

An all-absorbing topic of conversation in this year was the trial of
Warren Hastings, for his conduct whilst Governor-General of Bengal.
The trial commenced on the 13th of February, and it took place in
Westminster Hall, which was fitted up with a throne and canopy, having
the woolsack for the Lord Chancellor in front. On either side the
throne was a private box, one for the use of the King, the other for
the Queen: the King never used either throne or box, but, when he went
to the trial, he went _incognito_.

There were seats covered with green baize for the accommodation of
members of the House of Commons, but all the rest of the hall was
glowing with red baize. Boxes were also provided for the Ambassadors
and _Corps Diplomatique_. The grand show commenced at eleven A.M. with
the entrance of the committee appointed to manage the impeachment, all
of them in full dress, followed by Burke, who headed the members of
the House of Commons.

Hardly had they taken their seats when a buzz of excitement filled the
hall, for no one less than the Queen, attended by all her daughters,
entered. She did not go to the royal box, but sat in part of the Duke
of Newcastle's Gallery. This attracted the attention of all, until the
coming in of the peers, including the judges, and the Bishops, the
string of Dukes being closed by the Prince of Wales (as Duke of
Cornwall), and the Dukes of York, Gloucester, and Cumberland. Lord
Thurlow, the Lord Chancellor, came last. The peers all wore their
robes and collars, the robes of the royal dukes being borne by pages.
Then the Chancellor's mace-bearer cried "Oyez, Oyez, Oyez," and
notified to all, that Warren Hastings had come to take his trial, and
that his accusers might come forth and make good their charges against
him. The Lord Chancellor addressed the prisoner, and told him to be
prepared with his defence, to which Hastings replied, "My Lords, I am
come to this high tribunal equally impressed with a confidence in my
own integrity and in the justice of the court before which I stand."
As this trial will not again be mentioned, I may state the fact, that
it lasted seven years and three months, and ended in his acquittal,
17th April 1795.

Another remarkable event happened in this year, for on 31st January
there died at Rome, at the age of sixty-seven, the young Pretender,
Prince Charles Edward Louis Casimir Stuart, grandson of James II.;
and, with him, died all hope for the Jacobite party, for he left
behind him but one natural daughter, on whom he conferred the empty
title of Duchess of Albany. It is true that he left his pretensions to
the throne of England to his brother, Cardinal York, but all this
Prince did to claim regal honours was to strike a medal, on which he
styled himself Henry the IXth. He knew there was no use in continuing
the struggle, so accepted a pension from George III., which was paid
him until his death.

There is little worth chronicling until we come to the (to Englishmen)
most painful event of the year, namely, the King's illness. In July
his physicians remarked symptoms in him which gave them grave concern,
but he visited Cheltenham, and improved in his health. In October,
however, rumours began to get about that all was not well. The
_Morning Post_ of 30th October mentions that "On 28th His Majesty
complained of a pain in his bowels, and by the advice of his
physicians, and the rest of His Majesty's attendants, he is not
expected to leave Windsor for the course of a week or a fortnight."
Next day we hear that "the chief symptom is said to be a swelling in
the legs." Then news is brought, that on the 4th November he had a
relapse; on the 7th he is reported better, though, as a matter of
fact, he was delirious at dinner on the 5th. On the 9th they say he is
better; on the 10th he is MUCH BETTER, and HOPES ARE ENTERTAINED OF
HIS RECOVERY. The bulletins of the 11th are vague; that of the 12th
reports that he "was not better," and the newspapers of the 13th
openly speak of a Regency. In the _Morning Post_ of November 14th it
plainly states that "his mental faculties were more deranged." Then
his physicians quarrelled amongst themselves as to his treatment, and
wrote daily contradictory bulletins, until Dr. Willis took his patient
under his sole charge, with good effect. And so ends 1788.

       *       *       *       *       *

1789 opens with a great frost, one of the heaviest on record. It
commenced on the 24th November 1788, and continued, with one
intermission (from December 24th to December 26th) until 13th January
1789. On 10th January the Thames at Irongate--which is below London
Bridge, by the Tower, was frozen over, and several booths were erected
on the ice. The day previously an ox was roasted whole, and eagerly
bought by the people who were skating and sliding. The _Annual
Register_ thus describes the sight:--"The scene on the Thames is very
entertaining; from Putney Bridge upwards, the river is completely
frozen over, and people walk to and from the different villages on the
face of the deep. Opposite to Windsor Street booths have been erected
since Friday last, and a fair is kept on the river. Multitudes of
people are continually passing and repassing; puppet shows,
roundabouts, and all the various amusements of Bartholomew Fair are
exhibited. In short, Putney and Fulham, from the morning dawn till the
dusk of returning evening, is a scene of festivity and gaiety. On the
12th a young bear was baited on the ice, opposite to Redriffe
(Rotherhithe), which drew multitudes, and fortunately no accident
happened to interrupt their sport." The outward-bound vessels at
Deptford and Gravesend cleared out with all despatch, lest they should
be caught in the ice and detained or damaged.

The usual royal gift of £1000 to the poor of London was this year not
forthcoming, so the Prince of Wales ordered that sum to be given from
his own treasury. He also sent large sums to the poor of Edinburgh
and Brighton.

A Bill to make the Prince of Wales Regent had been introduced in both
Houses of Parliament at the latter end of 1788, but was negatived in
each; in the Commons by 251 to 178. There had been great squabbling
over this Bill, especially between the rival leaders, Fox and Pitt;
the former asserting that the Prince of Wales had an _absolute right_
to succeed to the Regency, and the latter would only admit that he had
an _irresistible claim_.

But the King did not get better, and something must be done, yet it
was not thought fit to invest the Prince of Wales with altogether
regal powers: there must be some limitation. Therefore Pitt wrote to
His Royal Highness, detailing the plan intended to be pursued, which
was, that the Queen should have the care of the King's person, and the
disposition of the royal household, by which means she would enjoy the
patronage of 400 places, amongst which were the offices of Lord
Steward, Lord Chamberlain, and Master of the Horse: but the Prince
should have no power of granting any office, reversion, or pension,
for any other term than during the King's pleasure, nor might he
confer any peerage.

This, no doubt, was prudent, but was extremely distasteful to the
Prince, who wrote a dignified remonstrance to Pitt, at the end of
which, however, he consented to accept the terms, being convinced of
the evils which might arise were there no Regency. Fifty-five peers,
together with the Dukes of York and Cumberland, signed a protest
against the limitations, but the Commons cared but little for it. They
went on with their work, and, on the 12th February, sent up the Bill
to their Lordships for consideration; and they were debating it when
the proverb of "There's many a slip 'twixt the cup and the lip" was
fulfilled. On the 19th February the Lord Chancellor announced to the
House that the physicians reported that the King was rapidly
recovering from his malady. On this the House adjourned, and
practically no work was done, either by Lords or Commons, for three
weeks.

On 27th February the prayer for his recovery was discontinued, and, in
its stead, a form of prayer, and thanksgiving for his restoration to
health, was ordered to be read in all churches and chapels throughout
England and Wales. So completely had he recovered, that he ordered
Parliament to be opened by Commission, which was done on 10th March.
The 23rd April was appointed for a general thanksgiving, and his
Majesty, accompanied by the Queen and the Royal Family, went in solemn
state to Saint Paul's, to render thanks to the Almighty for His great
mercy.

The following account is much condensed from the report in the
_Morning Post_ of 24th April 1789:--"They started early, for,
precisely at eight o'clock in the morning, the first carriage that led
the procession reached St. Clement's Church in the Strand. After the
usual state pioneers, came the members of the House of Commons,
followed by the peers according to their several degrees, then the
Archbishops, and the princes of the blood royal, after whom came the
Prince of Wales, whose equipage outshone all others. Their Majesties'
Household came next, and lastly their Majesties themselves.

"The Queen seemed inexpressibly happy: the loud huzzas, which from
every quarter rent the air, testified to her, that _he_ who was
dearest to her was dearest to the people.

"The King, as if impressed by the weight of the obligation which he
owed to Heaven for his recovery, and full of the religious solemnity
with which he was going, _publicly_, to acknowledge that obligation to
the Almighty, seemed to be unusually grave and silent; and behaved, at
this first appearance in public since his recovery, in a manner which
filled the spectators with reverence and awe.

"His Majesty appeared to be much reduced in point of size, but he
looked as if in perfect health."

It was a quarter-past three when the procession, on its return,
reached Temple Bar, and it was noted that the King looked more
cheerful, whilst the Queen was in high spirits.

London was, of course, brilliantly illuminated at night.

This is the principal event of the year, and with it we will close
1789.

       *       *       *       *       *

As far as England, and its social economy, is concerned, 1790 is very
barren. In France, there was the commencement of that dreadful
revolution which terrorised all Europe, yet strangely enough all
allusion to France was omitted in the Royal Speeches to Parliament,
either on 21st January or 26th November.

The navy sadly wanted manning, so much so that a proclamation was
issued for encouraging seamen, and landsmen, to enter themselves on
board His Majesty's ships of war; that officers on foreign stations
should join their respective corps, and recalling, and prohibiting
seamen from serving foreign princes, and states. This was all very
well, for the fleet was in urgent need of men, owing to the number of
ships being put in commission, and ordered to be got ready for sea
with the greatest expedition: for instance--

  At Deptford, 3;
  " Woolwich, 3;
  " Chatham, 3;
  " Sheerness, 3;
  " Portsmouth, 10 (one 100, and another 98 guns);
  " Plymouth, 7 (one 100 another 80 guns);

besides others which were expected to be commissioned in a few days.

Ordinary means were not sufficient to provide men, and resort was made
to impressment, a mode of obtaining seamen which is of ancient
practice. In 1378 a statute of 2 Richard II. speaks of it as being
well known, and so it must have been, for the first commission for its
use was issued 29 Edward III., 1355. In 1641, Parliament declared the
practice illegal, either for the land or sea service; but this has
always been ignored when the necessity for seamen arose. It has been
regulated by Parliament even so lately as 1835, when, by the statute 5
and 6 William IV., compulsory service is restricted to five years.

How should we feel if some day, in reading our morning paper, we
should come across such a passage as the following:--"A very hot press
took place in the river Thames, and at all the outports"?--Would you
like to know what a "hot press" means?--then learn from the following
excerpts from the _St. James's Chronicle_, May 4-6, 1790:--

"The report of the number pressed in the river on Tuesday night was
delivered to the Lords of the Admiralty yesterday morning, which
amounted to about 1500 taken in Wapping, and in Southwark, &c., more
than 600; amounting in the whole to upwards of 2100 men, besides those
at the different seaport towns, reports of which were not received."

"Four tenders went down the river yesterday morning, crowded with
impressed men, to be shipped on board a vessel of war lying in
Long-reach, ready to receive them. The same tenders were expected up
again with the return of the tide, upon the same errand."

_Extract of a letter from Chatham, May 5._--"Yesterday morning,
between six and seven o'clock, an express arrived from the Lords of
the Admiralty to Commodore Pasley, at this port, containing impress
warrants: accordingly, a great press commenced about twelve o'clock
last night, both in this town, Rochester, &c. &c., and on the river
Medway, when many persons were taken, four of whom were lodged in the
guardhouse in the yard, and this morning sent on board the 'Scipio,'
of 64 guns, lying as guardship at this port, and commanded by
Commodore Pasley. A great press likewise commenced last night at
Sheerness."

"In consequence of the press warrants, stocks felt a most
extraordinary depression yesterday; the Consols opened at 76, and
fluctuated from that price to 75-1/4 until very nearly three o'clock."

This then, was a "hot press"--but very little was ever said about it,
except a passing notice. The impressed men themselves accepted their
fate as inevitable, and, according to the testimony of an old seaman
whom I once knew (himself a pressed man), he assured me that, after
the first shock was over, they set to work with a will, and did their
duty as well as the volunteers. There were supposed to be exceptions,
such as apprentices, who were exempt, but I fear, when once in the
hands of the pressgang, it was a very poor chance of any one's getting
off.

A social note worthy of being recorded, in this year, was that a man
named John Frith, lieutenant of the second battalion of Royals, threw
a stone at His Majesty's coach. He seems to have done no harm, and was
evidently a lunatic, for no one in their senses would have endeavoured
to injure a king who was just then in the zenith of his popularity.
That he was insane the jury thought, for, on his trial for high
treason on 21st May, he was acquitted as being of unsound mind, but he
was put under safe watch and ward in Newgate, and only liberated on
11th December 1791, on bail being given to take proper care of him.

       *       *       *       *       *

The year 1791 is remarkable for its uneventfulness, nothing of
national importance occurring during the twelve-month. Impressment
still went on, as we see by the _St. James's Chronicle_, April
16-19.--"Friday night the press in the Thames, and on both sides the
river, was the warmest that has been at all since press warrants were
last issued. No fewer than eleven gallies were rowing about between
London Bridge and Deptford. Every one of His Majesty's frigates and
sloops on Channel service, as well as those in the North Sea and on
the Irish coast, have received orders to proceed upon the impress
service. The smaller vessels, as soon as they have procured forty
seamen each, are to deliver them over to the receiving ships at
Spithead and the Nore."

In 1787 a society was formed in England having for its object the
suppression of slavery, under the auspices of Granville Sharpe,
Clarkson, and others, and Mr. Wilberforce (by whose untiring efforts
its downfall was at last obtained) joined it. On the 18th April 1791,
the House of Commons resolved itself into a committee "to consider of
the African slave trade." Wilberforce made an eloquent speech, in
which he depicted the horrors of the trade. Among other barbarities he
mentioned the whipping, and holding red-hot coals, to the mouths of
those (in order to compel them to eat) who were desirous of putting an
end to their existence, by starving themselves to death; and, to prove
the preference given by those unhappy creatures of death to slavery,
he quoted part of the evidence, which told how they took every
opportunity of leaping overboard, and that, in the agonies of death,
when drowning, they would hold up their hands for joy in having
escaped from their tormentors.

He mentioned many cruelties which had passed unpunished, and
particularly one, which was committed by a master upon his female
slave, a girl about six years old, by cutting her mouth from ear to
ear; he showed how injurious the slave trade was to our mercantile
navy, quoting from the muster rolls of Liverpool and Bristol, that in
one year, out of 12,263 seamen employed in the slave trade, 2643 had
died.

After many other arguments, he concluded with a motion, "That the
Chairman be directed to move for leave to bring in a Bill for
preventing the further importation of African negroes into the British
colonies and plantations."

The debate was continued, and adjourned until the next day--when the
battle _pro_ slavery or its abolition waxed fierce; but when it came
to a decision, the numbers were--for the motion, 88; against,
163--majority against the abolition, 75.

       *       *       *       *       *

1792 opened, as we would fain have our financial years open
now-a-days, with an increase of revenue over the preceding year of
£300,000, and a surplus of more than £900,000, besides paying the
annual million in reduction of the national debt. Pitt repealed
£200,000 of burdensome taxes, added £400,000 to the million to
extinguish the debt, and discreetly kept the balance in hand for
eventualities. Trade had vastly increased, as we may see from the
following figures:--In 1783 the exports were valued at £14,741,000;
and, in 1791, they had risen to £20,120,000.

On 2nd April, the House of Commons being in Committee, Mr. Wilberforce
again brought forward the question of the slave trade, and, after an
eloquent speech, wound up with the motion:--"That it is the opinion of
the Committee, that the trade carried on by British subjects, for the
purpose of procuring slaves from Africa, ought to be abolished." After
a debate, Mr. Secretary Dundas moved as an amendment, to insert the
word "_gradually_" immediately before the word "abolished."

This was carried by a majority of 68, and the motion, so altered,
being put, the numbers were--Ayes, 230; Noes, 85--majority for the
motion, 145. The Chairman was then ordered to move the House for leave
to bring in a Bill, pursuant to the said resolution.

England could not but be affected by the French Revolution. At the
commencement of the movement there was some sympathy shown by the
Whigs to a people who were struggling to free themselves from the
trammels of despotism, but that sympathy rapidly grew cold, and faded,
on witnessing the excesses committed by the people of Paris, and some
other large cities, until the capture, and imprisonment of the Royal
family, turned it to absolute loathing, and hatred.

There was great uneasiness throughout the country as to whether the
tide of anarchy might not reach us, especially as numbers of fugitives
were daily reaching our shores. Take, for example, two instances
quoted in the _Annual Register_, both of the date 12th September:--

"_Southampton._--One Ayland, a fisherman of Hamble, a village about
seven miles from Southampton, was fishing for lobsters on the coast of
France on Thursday last, and had taken in about half his cargo, when
he espied two boats full of men, seemingly in great distress; on which
he bore down, and received them on board. They had swam to their boats
to get away from the coast, and many of them were much bruised and
pelted with stones by others on shore. They begged the fisherman to
land them somewhere in England, to prevent their being murdered; which
he promised to do, and offered them subsistence till he had completed
his lading. They represented the danger of being intercepted, if he
did not immediately proceed to sea, and offered him any sum he should
ask, to land them as soon as possible. He waived his own interest, set
sail, and landed them at the above village; but with a spirit of
humanity, which does honour to human nature, he absolutely refused any
reward whatever, although he had not completed his fishing, which is
the maintenance of his family."

"_Lewes._--Upwards of 500 unfortunate emigrants were, last week,
landed on our coast, who have had the fury of the elements to contend
with, after escaping that of their countrymen. The Brighton packets,
heavily laden with them, were driven by the winds far eastward off
their usual track, and with difficulty made Hastings, Pevensey, and
Eastbourne. At the former place, on Wednesday morning, 76, all
ecclesiastics, came on shore, among whom were the Bishop of
Auvranches, the Dean of Rouen, and several other dignitaries. The
Bishop with great difficulty escaped from Auvranches by the assistance
of one of his grand vicars, who, with domestics, accompanied him to
Rouen, where they were for some days concealed. The populace having
again discovered them, they were again obliged to travel on foot, in
disguise, to Dieppe. They arrived in the night, took refuge a few
hours in an hotel; and, at the time appointed for the departure of the
packet, ran to the sea side, and, it providentially being high water,
were enabled to get out of reach of the rabble, who, in one minute
after, pursued them to the shore."

Take again an extract or two from the _St. James's Chronicle_ of
11-13th September 1792. "Between daybreak and eight o'clock yesterday
morning, thirteen broad-wheeled waggons, crowded with _French
emigrants_, passed through the Borough. During the night, and the
whole of yesterday forenoon, waggons, carts, and chaises, and
carriages of almost every other description, continued arriving in
town with emigrants, by way of Westminster, Blackfriars, and London
Bridges."

"It is a known fact, that upwards of _forty thousand French_ men,
women, and children, are at this moment in England: two-thirds of them
of the lowest class, who, taking advantage of the convulsed state of
their native country, come over under the plausible title of _exiled
aristocrats_."

"There are three powerful reasons why the very great number of
arrivals here from France should excite the immediate attention of
Government. One, that it may occasion a rapid rise in the price of
provisions, already at a height that occasions much complaint among
the lower orders of people. Second, lest under the appellation of
fugitives, a multitude of insidious and evil-designing persons should
intrude themselves, with the intention of raising similar disturbances
in this kingdom. Third, lest it should be the means of introducing a
great number of rascals, thieves, and villains, who are always
cowards, and cannot have principle enough to take any side; these,
therefore, are the first to run. An inundation of them, added to the
bad among our own people, might not only render private property very
precarious, but even prove dangerous to the state."

The Government was fully alive to this great influx of Frenchmen, and
the possible effect it might have on the people of England; so they
introduced, and passed, the "Act for establishing Regulations
respecting Aliens arriving in this kingdom, or resident therein, in
certain cases," 33 Geo. III. cap. 4. After the preamble, the gist of
which has been given, this Act enacts that all masters of vessels are
to give to the officer of the Custom, at the port of arrival, a
written declaration specifying the names, &c., of foreigners on board.
All aliens arriving after 10th January 1793 were to give to the port
officer of the Customs a written declaration of their names, rank, &c.
If they failed in so doing, they were to depart out of the realm, or
be transported for life. The officer of Customs had to furnish them
with a certificate, and, if they wished to change their abode, they
were to have a passport, which they were to show, or be committed for
trial. They must also depart from the realm when ordered by His
Majesty's proclamation, &c. &c. &c.

[Illustration: Edmund Burke.]

This was a somewhat severe ordinance, but as far as I know, it was
never acted on, for the French _emigrés_ were a quiet, law-abiding
people, thankful for the refuge they had received. It was during the
debate on this Bill that Burke made his historical _coup de theatre_,
the dagger scene in the House of Commons. I quote from the _St.
James's Chronicle_ 27-29th December 1792:--Burke _loquitur_. "It had
been declared by a noble Lord (Granville) in another place, that there
were known to be _nineteen assassins_ in this country with daggers
for the extirpation of kings--but it had been said that nineteen were
of no consequence; he thought differently, for there were in that
number seven more than necessary to destroy the whole Royal family;
the number to him was alarming, for he knew not how many apprentices
those murderers might have, nor how many encouragers in this country;
the knowledge of nineteen French murderers having arrived, was a full
justification of the present Bill. He thanked His Majesty's Ministers
for having brought it forward; it might prevent the arrival of
nineteen times nineteen of those monsters, and it might counteract the
intentions of that Englishman who had ordered the manufacture of 5000
daggers at Birmingham--how many for exportation, or how many for home
consumption, he knew not. He had, however, strong reasons to believe
that they were intended to introduce _French fraternity_ into the
bosoms of Englishmen--to introduce murder and desolation, for '_there!
there!_' exclaimed Mr. Burke, _throwing a dagger upon the floor of the
House_, 'is the _fraternity of freedom_; that is the fraternity they
wish to plunge into the heart of our Sovereign; into the heart of
every virtuous Englishman who was loyal to his King, or worshipped his
God,'" &c. &c.

This rodomontade was only provocative of mirth, and it is said that
Sheridan asked--"You have thrown down the knife--where is the fork?"
which convulsed the House with laughter.

       *       *       *       *       *

1793 opened gloomily with the trial, sentence, and decapitation of
Louis XVI. (sentenced 17th January, beheaded 21st January); and our
national sympathy towards the martyred King was shown by an order for
a general mourning, which it was hoped would be universal. "As our
Court has ordered an etiquette mourning for Louis XVI., there can be
little doubt that the people will, as one man, clothe themselves in a
garb expressive of their detestation of his murtherers."

Our relations with France had been very strained, for some time past,
and war had long been expected. In December 1792 a proclamation had
been issued, embodying and calling out the militia. Vessels were being
hurriedly equipped, and commissioned, and nobody was surprised, when,
on 1st February, Parliament received a message from the King,
informing his people that M. Chauvelin had left this country, and that
there was an urgent necessity for augmenting the sea and land forces.
The number of French in England became a source of uneasiness, and an
Order of Council was issued on 2nd February, directing all aliens,
save such as were excepted by the Alien Act, to reside within fifty
miles of the standard on Cornhill, and ten miles from the sea coasts,
and dockyards.

The French had already begun hostilities, by laying an embargo on all
British shipping in French ports, and, on 5th February, we retaliated
by acting in the same manner; but the terms were not equal, for there
were but six, or eight, French vessels in our ports, whilst it was
reckoned that the French had got hold of over 1000 of our seamen. But
sailors were forthcoming to man the fleet, for we read, under 7th
February, that "Upwards of 2000 sailors entered the Royal Navy last
week."

On 11th February, the King sent the following message to Parliament:--

"George R.--His Majesty thinks proper to acquaint the House of
Commons, that the Assembly now exercising the powers of Government in
France have, without previous notice, directed acts of hostility to
be committed against the persons and property of His Majesty's
subjects, in breach of the law of nations, and of the most positive
stipulations of treaty, and have since, on the most groundless
pretensions, actually declared war against His Majesty and the United
Provinces; under the circumstances of this wanton and unprovoked
aggression, His Majesty has taken the necessary steps to maintain the
honour of his Crown, and to vindicate the rights of his people; and
His Majesty relies with confidence on the firm and effectual support
of the House of Commons, and on the zealous exertions of a brave and
loyal people, in prosecuting a just and necessary war, and
endeavouring, under the blessing of Providence, to oppose an effectual
barrier to the farther progress of a system which strikes at the
security and peace of all independent nations, and is pursued in open
defiance of every principle of moderation, good faith, humanity, and
justice.

"In a cause of such general concern, His Majesty has every reason to
hope for the cordial co-operation of those Powers who are united with
His Majesty by the ties of alliance, or who feel an interest in
preventing the extension of anarchy and confusion, and in contributing
to the security and tranquillity of Europe.

                                                  G. R."

The Government was determined to do nothing by halves, and, as the law
of nations had not yet condemned the practice, they (on the 12th
February) caused to be issued, by the Admiralty, letters of marque,[1]
and reprisals against the French shipping--whilst pressgangs scoured
the streets and boarded all vessels for seamen. As, for instance (16th
February), "A press broke out in the river yesterday morning, all the
seamen were taken from the colliers, and the gangs were very
successful." And every means were taken to get sailors to volunteer,
vide the following extract out of a letter from Rochester, 15th
February:--"Three guineas are given to an able-bodied seaman, two
guineas to an ordinary seaman, and one guinea to a landsman (above the
King's bounty), to those who shall enter within a month in this city;
being the voluntary generosity of the Mayor and corporation here." And
this example was followed by many other corporations.

          [Footnote 1: Power, license, or extraordinary commission,
          granted by a State to its subjects, to make reprisals at sea
          on the subjects of another, under pretence of
          indemnification for injuries received.]

War being declared, preparations for it were carried on with the
utmost vigour. The Duke of York, colonel of the Guards (afterwards on
12th April made general), addressed the three regiments on parade,
told them that he would accompany them to Holland, and asked for
volunteers. This met with an unanimous response, but the number
required being limited, such men, only, were selected, who were judged
fittest for the service, and they started on their expedition on 25th
February, after having been inspected by the King.

It is no part of the scheme of this book to follow the fortunes of the
war, and, as there is little else noteworthy in the year 1793, we pass
to the next year.

       *       *       *       *       *

On the 22nd February, 1794, His Majesty sent a message to Parliament,
calling attention to the expediency of increasing the land forces,
and, consequently, a large increase in the militia, and an addition to
the fencible corps, were voted, and the Secretary of State sent a
circular to all the Lords-lieutenant of Counties, recommending them to
solicit voluntary contributions towards carrying on the war.

Wilberforce still continued to agitate the slave question, although
not on the same lines as formerly. He changed his tactics, and, as the
sense of the House, on a previous occasion, was in favour of gradually
doing away with it, he introduced a Bill for abolishing that part of
the slave trade which related to the supply of foreign plantations. Of
course it met with opposition, Sir William Young moving that it be
read a second time this day (26th February) six months, but it was
carried in the Lower House, the numbers for the second reading being
56 against 38--majority, 18. The Bill, however, was thrown out in the
Lords, owing to the opposition of Lord Grenville, who argued that such
a Bill should not be introduced whilst the House was instituting
inquiry into the whole question. And so, for a time, it dropped,
perforce.

Many amongst us seem to think that Sir Rowland Hill originated the
penny post, but such is not the fact. That it was mainly through his
instrumentality that letters could be sent to all parts of England,
Scotland, and Ireland, at the uniform price of one penny, and that he
did much to re-organise the vast establishment of the post-office, is
beyond doubt; but the penny post existed long before that. There is a
squabble between Dockwra and Murray as to which of them commenced it
in 1683; at all events, the Government took it from Dockwra in 1690,
and afterwards gave him a pension of £500 a year, and he was made
Controller of the District Post; but he was finally discharged, on
account of some charges of malversation, &c., brought against him.

In 1711 an Act was passed abolishing the penny post, and on June 23rd
of that year a proclamation was issued, putting it in force. But it
was resuscitated, for we find, in the Parliamentary intelligence of
the _Times_, 26th February, 1794: "House of Commons, 25th February.
The House having gone into Committee, Mr. Long proposed some
resolutions to be adopted as an improvement on the mode of carrying
letters by the penny post. It was proposed that letters sent by the
penny post should be carried six times every day, and that an
additional duty of one penny should be paid to the King,--that is, as
we understand it, that the person who receives the letter shall pay a
penny in all cases, as well as he who sends it. Another resolution
was, that the postage of letters in the islands of Guernsey and Jersey
should be the same as in England." Pitt explained that the extra penny
would, probably, only cover the extra cost involved in having six
deliveries, and, after a short debate, the resolutions passed the
Committee.

The _Times_ (28th February 1794), commenting thereon says--"The new
Penny Post Office is likely to prove such a very great accommodation
to the public, that the only wonder is, it has been so long neglected.
Instead of the numbers of deliveries, and the hours of despatch
varying in different parts of the town, as at present, there will be
six deliveries each day in all parts of the town; by which means a
person living at Mary-le-Bonne may send letters to, or receive letters
from, Limehouse, a distance of seven miles, five times a day....
Persons putting in letters by nine in the morning, at the distance of
ten miles from the chief Penny Post Office, and later, at less distant
parts, may receive answers from London the same afternoon."

The Revolution in France still continued, as did then emigration, for
a return was made of the number of _emigrés_, who had been brought off
from Toulon by the British Fleet, and this report avers that they
numbered 14,877 men, women, and children. No wonder, then, at the
passing of the Alien Act.

The French Revolution, no doubt, stirred up the discontented, and
disaffected, in England: the perusal of Paine's "Rights of Man" in no
ways tended to soothe a rebellious feeling, and the mob, on several
occasions, was very riotous. Societies, like the "Corresponding
Society" and the "Society for Constitutional Information," were
founded in London, and the Government, feeling itself strong enough,
was determined to strike a blow and crush them: so, on the 12th May,
the King sent a message to Parliament, saying, that "having received
information that the seditious practices, which have been for some
time carried on by certain societies in different parts of the
country, have lately been pursued with increased activity and
boldness," &c.... he "has given directions for seizing the books and
papers of the said societies in London, which papers have been seized
accordingly, and these books and papers appear to contain matter of
the greatest importance." He directed them to be laid before
Parliament for consideration, so that they might take "measures
thereupon, as may appear to be necessary, for effectually guarding
against the further prosecution of these dangerous designs."

John Thelwall (political lecturer), Daniel Adams, and Thomas Hardy
were taken into custody. The latter two were examined before the Privy
Council on the 13th, the former on the 14th, on which date a Royal
Messenger went to Earl Stanhope's house, and arrested his lordship's
private secretary, the Rev. Jeremiah Joyce. A famous agitator, the
Rev. John Horne Tooke, was also taken. Their trials took place in
October, November, and December 1794, and ended in the acquittal of
the prisoners, after which the Government abandoned similar
prosecutions.

But a patriotic feeling was abroad, more than enough to
counterbalance these turbulent spirits. The vast majority of the
population was loyal, and volunteers hastened to band together for the
defence of their country. One or two instances will suffice. "On the
17th April the Court of Common Council of the City of London agreed to
open a subscription for raising, and disciplining, a regiment of
infantry and a troop of cavalry for the defence of the city, to be
called the 'Loyal London Volunteers.'"--"_Rutland Volunteers Troops of
Cavalry._ On the 5th instant, 154 men and horses, consisting of the
high sheriff, the noblemen, gentlemen, and yeomen, who intend forming
this corps, met at Oakham.... Uniform, French gray and buff. Every
person who belongs to this corps binds himself, under £50 penalty, to
attend when called upon."--_Times_, 21st April. These two instances
shew the wide range the volunteers' movement--then in its very
infancy--took.

The feeling, however, of the nation was not altogether unanimous in
favour of war. There was then, as now, a peace party. On 6th March Mr.
Whitbread moved an address to the King, strongly disapproving of the
policy of the Government, and of their conduct, not only preceding,
but succeeding the war. The Earl of Guildford did the same in the
Lords, but in both Houses the motions were negatived by large
majorities. Nothing daunted by this, on 30th May, the Duke of Bedford,
in the House of Lords, reviewed the causes which led to the war, and
also the foreign policy of the Government, ending by moving fourteen
resolutions, of which the most material were the two following:--"That
it appeared expedient to that House, that it should recommend to His
Majesty to adopt such measures as might lead to a negotiation for
peace."

Or that, "if His Majesty, in his wisdom, thought it advisable still
to prosecute the war, that he would be most graciously pleased to
state what the object of it was."

After a debate, which lasted till half-past one o'clock, it was
adjourned till the following Monday.

In the Commons, Fox took the same tone, winding up with--"The
advantages we had gained by sea and land were favourable for the
negotiation of a peace, as they served as so many funds to induce the
enemy to treat; and, should we fail, we should thereby justify our
pacific intentions to the world." He concluded by moving resolutions
similar to those of the Duke of Bedford. The result was--For the
previous question, 208; for Mr. Fox's resolutions, 55--majority, 153.
And no more was heard of the Duke of Bedford's resolutions.

The next, and last, great incident was, Lord Howe's great naval
victory over the French off the coast of Ushant, on "the glorious
first of June." Two 80 and five 74 gun ships were the substantial
fruits of this victory, although "Le Vengeur," one of the 74's, sunk
soon after capture, drowning some 300 men. No one knows the French
loss in this battle, but we do know, that on board the prizes taken
there were found 1200 dead bodies. Our total loss was 904. The news
travelled very fast, for that day; Sir Roger Curtis, Howe's first
captain, arrived at the Admiralty with despatches on the evening of
the 10th June.

The jubilation was great, nor was practical sympathy with the widows
and orphans of our seamen wanting. In less than one hour a thousand
guineas were subscribed at Lloyd's for their relief. The popular
rejoicing took the form of illuminating the houses, smashing Earl
Stanhope's windows, and much beer drinking. The thanks of both Houses
of Parliament were given to Earl Howe, and, on his arrival at
Portsmouth, the King, Queen, and the Royal family went down and paid
him a visit on board his own ship, on 29th June. As there is a
crispness, and freshness, about contemporary accounts of events, let
the _Times_ (July 1st) tell the story.

"On the King being received on board the 'Queen Charlotte,' he
presented Earl Howe with a diamond hilted sword. His lordship,
perceiving His Majesty's intention, threw the sword he had on his side
upon the deck, and, kneeling, received from the Sovereign's hand this
distinguished proof of approbation. His Majesty also presented a gold
chain, to which a medal is hereafter to be annexed, to Admiral Sir
Alexander Hood, and Rear-Admiral Gardner; the like honour was
conferred on Lord Howe's first captain, Sir Roger Curtis. The wounded
Admirals, Bowyer and Pasley, who consequently could not attend, have
been distinguished with similar marks of His Majesty's favour."

Poor Admirals Bowyer and Pasley had to be pensioned off, on account of
their wounds, in February 1795, the sum awarded to each being £500 per
annum.

       *       *       *       *       *

At the commencement of 1795 the French took possession of Utrecht,
Rotterdam, and Dort: the treasure of the Prince of Orange was sent to
London, and the Stadtholder and his family had to make a hurried
flight for their lives in an open boat, luckily reaching Harwich
safely. The French having thus occupied Holland, the English
Government laid an embargo on all Dutch vessels in our ports.

The Opposition still attempted to embarrass the Government on the
question of the War, and, on 26th January, Mr. Grey, in a very lengthy
speech, brought forward a motion, recommending peace with France. Pitt
came forward with an amendment, to the purport that there could be no
security for peace whilst the Government of France was an irregular
one, and, on its being put, it was carried by 269 to 86.

Wilberforce still kept "pegging away" at the Slave Trade, and, on 26th
February, introduced a motion, "for leave to bring in a Bill for the
abolition of the slave trade, at a time to be limited." Pitt lent him
the weight of his influence, but it was a small House, and he lost it
by a majority of 17.

Fox, naturally (being in opposition), was always baiting the
Government, and on 24th March he moved, "That the House should resolve
itself into a Committee to inquire into the state of the nation;" but
he suffered a severe defeat, the numbers against his motion being 219;
for, 63.

The English troops in Holland had met with a series of misadventures,
and were compelled to retreat. A fine array of 35,000 men left our
shores for this expedition, and but about a fifth part could be
mustered when they reached the town of Bremen, on the 27th and 28th of
March--and right glad were they to embark on board the transports
lying in the Elbe, ready to receive them.

       *       *       *       *       *

The harvest of 1794 had been bad, and bread and provisions generally
were so dear as practically to amount to a famine among the poor.
People, as a rule, will, unfortunately, not starve quietly, so we
hear of food riots occasionally. On 11th April a mob at Portsea
attacked the butchers' and bakers' shops, and compelled them with
persuasive eloquence to sell, the one, meat at 4d per lb.--the other,
bread at 6d a quartern loaf. Again on 20th April, the Oxford Militia,
with loaded guns and fixed bayonets, went to Seaford, where, having
confiscated all the beef and mutton they could lay their hands on,
they sold it at 4d per lb., and then, going to Newhaven, they seized
2000 sacks of flour, and sold it at their own price. This flagrant
breach of military discipline was, however, soon punished, for the
Horse Artillery and Lancashire Fencibles came up and took the rioters
prisoners. But similar riots were rife all through the Midlands.

In the autumn things got even worse, and Parliament was assembled
earlier than usual to deliberate on a remedy for this state of things;
the outcome of which was an order for a bounty of twenty shillings per
quarter on wheat from the Mediterranean, fifteen shillings on wheat
from America, and five shillings per quarter on Indian corn. Bills
also were passed prohibiting the manufacture of starch from wheat, and
also the distillation of spirit from grain.

This scarcity of food, and the heavy burdens, both in taxation, the
levying of men, and the pressgangs, fell sorely on the poor, who
murmured loudly,--a fact which was duly taken advantage of by the
demagogues for their own seditious purposes. They agitated for
universal suffrage and annual parliaments, and the movement gathered
strength. On the 26th October, the Corresponding Society held a mass
meeting in Copenhagen Fields, and the inflammatory speeches there
delivered, no doubt, bore their fruit three days afterwards, when the
mob stoned the King. As the _Times'_ account of this assault is very
meagre, compared with that in the _Annual Register_, I copy the latter
_verbatim_.

"_29th October._--On the occasion of His Majesty's going to the House
of Lords, the Mall and the Parade of St. James's Park, and Parliament
Street, were completely choked up with spectators. The crowd was by no
means so great at the Coronation, and, to see the King go to the
House, there never were before more than a tenth part of the numbers
of this day; for they, at least, amounted to 200,000. Several noblemen
and Cabinet Ministers passed through the Park from Buckingham House
about two o'clock. The Earl of Chatham, Duke of Gloucester, &c., were
hissed, and the Duke of Portland was very much hooted.

"About twenty minutes afterwards the King left Buckingham House, and
was violently hissed and hooted and groaned at the whole way; but no
violence was offered till he arrived opposite the Ordnance Office,
when a small pebble, or marble, or bullet, broke one of the windows.
In returning, the moment His Majesty entered the Park the gates of the
Horse Guards were shut, for the purpose of excluding the mob who
followed the carriage; at which, as it passed opposite Spring Gardens
Terrace, another stone was thrown, but it fortunately struck the
woodwork between the windows.

"The crowd now pressed closely round the coach, and His Majesty, in
considerable agitation, signified, by waving his hands to the Horse
Guards on each side, his anxiety that the multitude should be kept at
a distance. In this way he passed on through the Park, and round by
the Stable Yard, into St. James's Palace, at the front gate, the
bottom of St. James's Street. A considerable tumult took place when
His Majesty was about to alight, and one of the horses in the state
coach took fright, threw down an old groom of the name of Dorrington,
and broke one of his thighs, but it proved, fortunately, a simple
fracture; his other thigh was considerably bruised, but not
dangerously.

"A few minutes after His Majesty had entered the palace, the mob
attacked the state coach with stones, and did it great injury. In its
way along Pall Mall to the Mews many things were also thrown at it.
After a short time the King went, in his private coach, from St.
James's to Buckingham House; but, on his way through the Park the mob
surrounded the carriage, and prevented it from proceeding, crying out,
'Bread! Bread! Peace! Peace!'--The Guards were, however, speedily
brought up, and they protected the carriage till His Majesty got safe
into Buckingham House.

"When His Majesty entered the House of Peers, the first words he
uttered were these, to the Lord Chancellor: 'My Lord, I have been shot
at!' This alluded to the substance which had broke the window while
passing the Ordnance Office.

"Three or four persons were apprehended on suspicion of having thrown
stones, &c., at the King, and one of them was charged with having
called out, 'No king,' and other such expressions. They were all
examined at the Duke of Portland's office; and, waiting the result of
this business, nothing was done in the House of Lords till near six
o'clock, when Lord Westmoreland, who rode in the carriage with the
King, having previously moved 'that strangers be ordered to withdraw,'
stated the insult and outrage with which the King had been treated;
and added that His Majesty, and those who had accompanied him, were of
opinion that the glass of the coach had been broken by a ball from an
air-gun, which had been shot from a bow window of a house adjoining
the Ordnance Office, with a view to assassinate him.

"The King, through the whole of the riot, displayed the cool
magnanimity for which the family have ever been distinguished. At the
time that the glass of the coach was broken, he said to Lord
Westmoreland, 'That is a shot;' and, instead of leaning back in the
carriage, or striving to avoid the assassin, he pointed to the round
hole in the pane, and examined it. But this was not all; he went into
the private coach, to go from St. James's to the Queen's house, in the
midst of the wildest commotions of the multitude, thereby exposing
himself, almost without guards, to their fury; and then it was that
His Majesty's person was most imminently in danger."

"_30th October._--Confident in the attachment of his people,
notwithstanding the alarms of the preceding day, the King, accompanied
by Her Majesty and three of the Princesses, visited Covent Garden
Theatre, and, at their entrance, was received with the usual burst of
applause. 'God save the King' was sung twice, and, by a considerable
part of the house, over-zealously called for a third time; this, in a
corner of the gallery, provoked a few hisses, which, however, were
soon overruled, and one or two of the most active of the turbulent
party were turned out; after which the performance went on."

Five persons were apprehended for this outrage, but with the exception
of one, Kidd Wake, aged 27, a journeyman printer, who owned to his
hissing and hooting at His Majesty, and who was committed to take his
trial on 14th November, I cannot trace their fate; probably they were
discharged for want of evidence.

A Royal Proclamation was issued, offering one thousand pounds reward
to any one "who shall give information, so that any of such authors,
actors, or abettors, as aforesaid, shall be apprehended and brought
to justice."

In November there were fearful storms, especially on the 6th, which
were extraordinarily destructive, both to life and property. One of
these storms was so severely felt at Weymouth, that nearly 1600 dead
bodies were, at different times, thrown up on the beach, 300 being
buried at one time, and, had not the Gloucestershire Militia helped in
burying them, there would, doubtless, have been a pestilence.

On 8th December Pitt, in the House of Commons, delivered a message
from the King, in which occurs the following passage, which must have
been hailed with thanksgiving throughout the length and breadth of the
land:--"His Majesty, on this occasion, thinks proper to acquaint the
House, that the crisis which was depending[2] at the commencement of
the present session, has led to such an order of things in France, as
will induce His Majesty (conformably to the sentiments which he has
already declared) to meet any disposition to negotiation on the part
of the enemy, with an earnest desire to give it the fullest and
speediest effect, and to conclude a treaty for general peace, whenever
it can be effected on just and suitable terms for himself and his
allies."

          [Footnote 2: (?) impending.]

At the commencement of 1796 the Royal Family were still in bad odour
with a certain section of the public,--nor can it be wondered at by
any one who has studied the satirical prints of the day. Every foible
of Royalty was noted, exaggerated, engraved on "perennial brass,"
exhibited most freely in the shop windows, and most eagerly purchased.
Farmer George, and his simple, and somewhat mean habits, the Queen's
avarice, the Prince of Wales' licentiousness, and extravagance, and
all the scandals (and they were many) appertaining to the rest of the
Royal Family, were ruthlessly laid bare, and mercilessly exposed to
the public gaze.

That this must have tended to lower the Royal Family in most men's
eyes, there can be no doubt, so that we are not very much surprised at
the occasional practical manifestations of the mob. On the night of
1st February, there was more stone-throwing on the part of the
populace, which the _Times_ of 3rd February thus describes:--"On
Monday night, as the Royal Family were returning from Drury Lane
Theatre, just as they reached the middle of Pall Mall, a stone was
flung at the coach in which were their Majesties and the
lady-in-waiting, which broke the glass, and, entering the carriage,
struck the Queen on the cheek, and fell into Lady Harrington's lap.

"A deposition of the circumstances was taken yesterday at the Duke of
Portland's office, at which his Grace and some of the Bow Street
Magistrates were present; when four of the footmen attending their
Majesties were examined; a reward will be immediately offered to
discover the offender." And so it was to the extent of £1000, but
nothing came of it.

Whilst on the subject of the royal unpopularity, I may mention that
Kydd Wake, who last year was apprehended for hissing and hooting at
the King, was tried before Lord Kenyon, for "trespass, riot, and
misdemeanour," and found guilty--sentence being deferred. This,
however, was pronounced upon him by Mr. Justice Ashurst at the Court
of King's Bench 7th May. His judgment was somewhat long-winded, and he
concluded thus:--"It now becomes my duty to pronounce the sentence of
the Court; which is, that you be committed to the custody of the
keeper of the Penitentiary House, in, and for, the County of
Gloucester, and be kept to hard labour for the space of five years;
and, within the first three months of that time, that you stand in,
and upon, the Pillory for one hour, between the hours of eleven and
two o'clock in the afternoon, in some public street on a market day;
and that you give sureties in £1000, for your good behaviour for the
term of ten years, to be computed from the expiration of the said five
years; and that you be further imprisoned till you find the said
sureties."

On the 15th February, Mr. Grey, in the House of Commons, again
ventilated the subject of peace, this time in the shape of an address
to the King, praying him to communicate to the executive government of
France, his readiness to meet any disposition to negotiate a general
peace. Both Pitt and Fox spoke on the subject, but the motion was lost
by 189 to 50.

There was one crumb of comfort to the nation, which had hitherto been
suffering from a grievous scarcity of bread-stuffs, and this was the
great fall in wheat, which took place on 31st March. On that date,
owing to the large importations of foreign wheat, this grain fell 13s.
per quarter.

Joy, too, must have sprung up in the national heart when the King made
his speech on the opening of both Houses, 7th October. He said:--"I
have omitted no endeavours for setting on foot negotiations to restore
peace to _Europe_, and to secure, for the future, general
tranquillity. The steps I have taken for this purpose have at length
opened the way to an immediate and direct negotiation, the issue of
which must either produce the desirable end of a just, honourable, and
solid Peace for Us, and for Our Allies, or must prove, beyond dispute,
to what cause alone the prolongation of the calamities of war must be
ascribed. I shall immediately send a person to Paris with full powers
to treat for this object, and it is My anxious wish that this measure
may lead to the restoration of General Peace; but you must be sensible
that nothing can so much contribute to give effect to this desire, as
your manifesting that We possess both the determination and the
resources to oppose, with increased activity and energy, the farther
efforts with which We have to contend."

The "person" who was to go over to France as Plenipotentiary, was Sir
James Harris, who had lately been made Lord Malmesbury--and he arrived
at Paris on 22nd October. The usual diplomatic fencing took place, but
this was brought to an end by a squabble respecting the annexation of
the Netherlands to France. Lord Malmesbury wished to communicate with
his Government on this point, but the Directory meant to force his
hand, and required his ultimatum within twenty-four hours, and, as he
still asked for time, he was told his presence in Paris was useless,
and that he must depart within two days. He replied that he would
leave next day, and demanded his passports. On the 20th December he
left Paris for England, and so ended, for a while, all hopes of peace.
That the French had but faint hopes of a successful end to the mission
is evident, for, during the negotiations, on 2nd November, the Council
of Five Hundred passed a decree, prohibiting the importation of
British goods into the Republic.

As a proof of the patriotism of the English people, and their thorough
reliance on the Government, Pitt asked for a loan of eighteen
millions. This loan, called "The Loyalty Loan," was opened on 5th
December, and in _15 hours 20 minutes_ it was all subscribed. The
_Times_ of 6th December says--"Yesterday, soon after 11 o'clock, the
SUBSCRIPTION for EIGHTEEN MILLIONS STERLING, for the services of the
ensuing year, closed at the Bank; and such was the general desire to
subscribe, that the Court Room was a scene of the utmost confusion.
Many gentlemen were altogether disappointed; and those who could get
near the books to put down their names, did so with the utmost
difficulty. There was very little remaining to be subscribed; for a
great number of orders had been received by Mr. Newland in the
morning, from the country, which claimed a preference; and,
accordingly, the doors were shut some time, until these commissions
were written down. There is no doubt but that many millions more would
have been subscribed, if the public service had required it. There
cannot be a greater proof of the patriotism of all ranks of people in
thus assisting Government, because, at the time the loan was opened,
the other funds were considerably the cheapest purchase."

Nor was it money only, that our forefathers gave. In October 195,000
men were voted for the land service for the year 1797, and 120,000
seamen and marines for the navy. There was also a levy of 15,000 men,
from the different parishes, for sea service, and recruiting the
regiments of the line, and a supplementary militia was raised, of
60,000 men, not to be immediately called out, but to be enrolled,
officered, and completely trained, so as to be ready in a moment of
danger, and a force of 20,000 irregular cavalry was also embodied.

The year closed with a frost which exceeded in severity any known for
many years. Many people were frozen to death, and the thermometer was
34, and 35 degrees below freezing point.

       *       *       *       *       *

1797 opened very gloomily; finance, the backbone of a nation, was
somewhat dislocated. People were alarmed at the rapid growth of the
National Debt, and, selling out of the funds, found other investments
for their capital: there had been an enormous drain of bullion to
subsidise the allies, and Pitt had borrowed from the Bank in the most
reckless manner. It was in vain that the Bank remonstrated with him,
but still he borrowed, so that at last he had to be told that if he
took any more, it would probably lead to the insolvency of the Bank.
There was a run upon the country banks, and its effects were soon felt
in London; and, on 26th, an order of the Privy Council was made,
forbidding the Bank of England from making cash payments, until
Parliament had been consulted. On inquiry, it was found that the Bank
was not only perfectly solvent, but, after payment of all liabilities,
its capital would amount to £9,660,290. Under these circumstances Mr.
Pitt brought in a bill (37 George III. cap. 28), permitting the Bank
to issue notes from 20s. upwards, in lieu of cash. This measure
brought relief, and saved the National credit.

Perhaps one of the chief National events in the year, was the mutiny
of the fleets. Looking at it from this distance of time, one can
hardly wonder at it, especially when we consider the way in which the
crews were procured, by impressment and otherwise, their hard fare,
the bad accommodation for them, the frequent punishments, from 50 to
500 lashes, at the discretion of a possibly irate captain, frequently
for venial offences; add to this, small pay, and constant work, and we
are fain to acknowledge that the men who could stand such treatment
tamely, were almost more than human.

Yet they stated their grievances very properly, and quietly, sending
petitions, either in February, or March, to Lord Howe, begging him to
use his influence with the Admiralty, to procure them an increase of
wages, and an improvement in the quality, and quantity, of their
provisions. No notice whatever was taken of this temperate
remonstrance, so the men, finding no help came to them, tried to help
themselves, and secret communication was opened between all the
vessels of the fleet. No one can defend the gross breach of discipline
of which they were guilty, but it must be remembered that they were
ignorant men, smarting under a sense of injury, rendered especially
galling, by their just complaints, and moderate demands, being utterly
ignored.

Their plot to seize the ships, and expel the officers, came to be
known, and, on 15th April, Admiral Lord Bridport, in obedience to
orders from the Admiralty, signalled for the fleet to sail. But the
men refused to put to sea (unless an enemy was known to be at sea),
until their grievances had been examined into, and redressed. A
deputation, of two men from each ship, met in the Admiral's cabin, and
another petition was drawn up. On the 18th, a Committee of the Lords
of the Admiralty went to Portsmouth, to investigate the seamen's
claims; and the result was, that Admiral Bridport returned to his ship
on 23rd April, and, having hoisted his flag, he told his crew that he
brought with him the redress of all their grievances, and the King's
pardon for all offenders.

One would imagine that this would satisfy them, coming as it did from
the mouth of their "father and friend," but when, on the 7th of May,
he signalled to put to sea, no ship would obey him. The fact is, the
men were suspicious; they had been so badly treated with regard to the
granting of their moderate demands, that they thought the order for
sailing was only a ruse to get them away, and then faith would not be
kept with them. This mutiny was unfortunately accompanied by
bloodshed, and it lasted until the 14th May. On the 11th, Lord Howe
visited the fleet, saw the delegates, and assured them, that before a
Royal pardon could be proclaimed, they must express contrition for
their conduct. This they did, but solemnly declared they would never
again receive on board those officers they had sent on shore. This was
agreed to, and Lord Howe, on the 14th of May, showed them an Act of
Parliament, which granted what they wished, and the fleet at St.
Helens were, for a time, content.

But, at the Nore, there was much discontent, or rather open mutiny;
the men had forced the Admiralty to grant their demands, and now
thought they could go in for more; and, to enforce it, they attempted
to blockade the Thames, and prevent any vessel from entering or
departing,--and they did fire on several that attempted to run the
blockade. Of course, such a state of things could not last long, and
the removal of all the buoys, by the Admiralty, helped to bring about
a surrender. Their provisions began to run short, and the Government
peremptorily refused to accede to their demands. Some of the fleet
left, and returned to their duty, on the 9th June. On the 10th, more
struck the red flag, and on the 12th, there were but seven left that
were not flying the Union Jack; and next day, five of them sought the
protection of Sheerness.

The mutiny was now at an end, and it only remained to deal with the
ringleaders, the chief of whom was named Richard Parker, and he, and
several others, were duly hanged. Many who were sentenced to death
were, however, pardoned, and a general veil of oblivion was wisely
thrown over the whole affair, as soon as the men returned to their
duty.

Earlier in the year occurred a curious page in our history, nothing
less than a practical invasion of England by the French, details of
which can best be learned from contemporary accounts.

     "London Gazette, Extraordinary, February 25.

     "A letter this day received by the Duke of Portland, from Lord
     Milford, Lord-Lieutenant of the County of Pembroke, dated
     _Haverfordwest, February 23rd, 5_ P.M., contains information that
     two frigates, a corvette, and a lugger, appeared off the coast of
     Pembrokeshire the 22nd inst., and on the evening of that day
     disembarked some troops reported by deserters to be about 1200,
     but without field-pieces."

       *       *       *       *       *

     "London Gazette, Extraordinary, February 26.

     "_Haverfordwest, February 24, 1797, 6 o'clock_ A.M.--Since I had
     the honour of writing last to your Grace by Express, I have
     received information of the French ships having sailed, and left
     300 men behind, who have surrendered themselves prisoners. The
     great Spirit and Loyalty that the Gentlemen and Peasantry have
     shown on this occasion exceeds description. Many thousands of the
     latter assembled, armed with pikes, and scythes, and attacked the
     enemy, previous to the arrival of the Troops that were sent
     against them."

     "_February 24th, 9 o'clock_ P.M.--I have the honour and pleasure
     to inform your Grace, that the whole of the French troops,
     amounting to near 1400 men, have surrendered, and are now on
     their march to Haverfordwest."

And so ends the invasion of England.

On 14th February, Admiral Sir John Jervis, with fifteen sail of the
line, attacked the Spanish Fleet of twenty-seven sail of the line, off
Cape St. Vincent, captured four large vessels, and dispersed the
fleet. The news reached England on 3rd March, when London was
brilliantly illuminated.

The Whigs moved heaven and earth in order to oust Pitt and his
Government, but without success. On March 3rd the inhabitants of
Westminster met in Palace Yard, and resolved to petition the King to
dismiss his Ministry. In the City, too (the bones of whose _patres
conscripti_ would shake with indignation, could they but know of the
present wave of Conservatism, which has flowed over this Corporation),
loud, and many, were the calls to the same purport. In vain were
Common Halls convened, in vain did the Remembrancer, and the Sheriffs,
wait upon his Majesty with petitions; he would have none of them, but
would be glad to see them at a Levée; and so Pitt kept in,
notwithstanding the growls all round.

France was making peace with its enemies, one by one, and it could
easily be foreseen that, very shortly, England would have to bear all
the brunt of the war; therefore, on the 1st June, a note from Lord
Grenville was presented to M. de la Croix, the French Minister for
Foreign Affairs, in which was expressed the wish of the English
Government to negotiate preliminaries of peace. Of course there was
some diplomatic fence; but, finally, it was settled that Lord
Malmesbury should again go as Plenipotentiary. He arrived at Lisle on
6th July, but the demands of the French were outrageous, and, after,
in vain, combating their absurd requirements, he demanded his
passports, and left Lisle on 18th September.

On 11th October, Admiral Duncan attacked the Dutch fleet off
Camperdown, and, after a terrible action, defeated it, capturing
eleven vessels, and sinking one.

About the last event of national interest, occurring in this year, is
the formation of the French "Army of England," which was destined for
our invasion, and which was to be under the command of General
Buonaparte, which is about the first time our great enemy came into
active collision with us.

At the commencement of 1798, the financial pressure on the nation,
caused by the war, was very great. A triple assessed tax, a loan of
£15,000,000, additional duties on salt, tea, dogs, horses and
carriages, and a tax on armorial bearings, came home to every one.
Yet, English patriotism was sound to the core, and the people helped
the Government nobly, by means of voluntary contributions. A few
examples will show how every class vied with each other in
subscribing. They are taken from the _Times_.

_February 7th._--"Yesterday the Marquis of Buckingham subscribed at
the Bank, the profits of one year's income from his Tellership of the
Exchequer. On Monday the Duke of Marlborough subscribed £5000 at the
Bank. The city of Oxford has subscribed £500 as a voluntary donation,
to be continued for three years, if the war lasts so long."

_February 8th._--"The subscriptions yesterday at the Bank amounted to
upwards of £30,000. Among the subscribers were--the Earl of Carlisle
£4000, and the Bishop of Litchfield and Coventry £1000. But the
largest individual subscriptions are expected from Manchester, from
whence letters were yesterday received, stating that three mercantile
houses in that opulent town had subscribed Thirty-five Thousand
Pounds, and that Mr. Peele's house gave £20,000."

On the 9th February a meeting, on this subject, was held at the Royal
Exchange, the Lord Mayor, Aldermen, and most prominent citizens being
present--and the result is thus stated in the _Times_, 10th
February:--"As soon as the meeting was dissolved, four separate books
were opened on the Hustings; and at the close of the day, the exact
sum subscribed _in cash_, was _Forty-six Thousand, Five Hundred, and
Thirty-four Pounds, Three Shillings and sixpence_, which, if
calculated for the time the books were opened, is at the rate of £400
a minute. The number of subscribers was 218, and the subscriptions
from one guinea to £3000, which last sum was the donation of Boyd,
Benfield, & Co., with the promise of continuing it annually during the
war."

_14th February._--"The City of London yesterday subscribed £10,000
towards the contributions to the Bank. Yesterday the sum of £18,900
was subscribed by the merchants on the Royal Exchange."

It would be wearisome to detail all the subscriptions, but yet two or
three more may be recorded. The Bank of England gave £200,000, and the
King and Queen £20,000, and £5000 respectively, out of their private
purses; and on 20th September the amount of the voluntary
contributions then subscribed, was £1,514,993, 12s. 9d.

Ireland, this year, was more than disaffected: it was in open
rebellion, and, on 30th March, a proclamation was issued by the
Lord-Lieutenant, for suppressing such rebellion. That it was a most
serious one, is evidenced by a paper in Lord Edward Fitzgerald's
handwriting, that, at a meeting held 26th February 1798, a return was
made that there were in Ulster, Leinster, and Munster, 269,896 armed
men, and that their treasurer had £1485, 4s. 9d. in hand. That this
was not altogether an exaggeration, is shewn by the fact that, in the
year 1797, there were seized by the Government, in the provinces of
Leinster, and Ulster, alone, 49,109 guns, 1756 bayonets, 4463 pistols,
4183 swords, 248 blunder-busses, 119 musket-barrels, 106 sword-blades,
22 pieces of ordnance, and 70,630 pikes, besides other weapons
voluntarily surrendered. In the same year, 14,973 pikes were
surrendered in the county of Kildare alone, and in Dublin, on 11th May
1798, 5 pieces of cannon, and 500 pike handles, were seized.

On 24th May, seeing that war was being openly waged against the
Government, the Lord-Lieutenant issued a proclamation warning the
people that they were put under martial law, and, on the morrow, the
rebels were defeated, with much loss, near Carlow, and, after the
engagement, about 200 of them were hanged, or shot. Then the rebels
gained a slight advantage, especially at Enniscorthy, where they
compelled the garrison to retreat. This, and a few other small
successes, were amply avenged by Lord Lake, on 21st June, at Vinegar
Hill, a position which the Irish had held since the 28th May. Their
rout was complete, and their slaughter must have been immense, for no
quarter was given by the Royal troops. Then came the trials of the
ringleaders, and the gibbet was in constant requisition.

And, now, the French must needs have a finger in this pie, although
their attempt at invasion was simply ludicrous. The following is the
first official news, and it is a letter from the Duke of Portland to
the Lord Mayor:--"_27th August._ I think it right to inform your
Lordship, that, by official accounts received this morning from the
Lord-Lieutenant of Ireland, it appears that three French frigates,
unaccompanied by any transports, appeared in the Bay of Killala, on
the evening of the 22nd instant, and landed about 700 men, who
immediately took possession of the town of Killala, and made a small
party of the Prince of Wales' Fencible Regiment, consisting of an
officer and 20 men, and some yeomen, prisoners; a large force is
collecting from different quarters, and every necessary preparation
making for attacking the enemy."

This expedition, consisting of 1030 privates and 70 officers under
General Humbert, had sailed from Rochelle, with the intention of
rendering material help to the Irish rebels--and, after the capture of
Killala, they marched on Castlebar, where was a force of from 2000 to
3000 regulars, under Lord Lake. The English artillery, however,
expended their ammunition too soon; a fact the French did not lose
sight of, but, charging, put the English force to flight, and
they then occupied Castlebar. But here was the end of their
success--General Lake and Lord Cornwallis surrounded them, and the
French had to surrender, but no quarter was given to the Irish. The
number of French troops, on their surrender, was 96 officers, and 748
non-commissioned officers and privates, the rest having been lost
since their landing at Killala. This force was intended to be the
vanguard of a larger expedition, which was prevented joining, by want
of funds.

Another little expedition set sail from France, to help General
Humbert, consisting of one ship of the line, eight frigates, a
schooner, and a brig. It was met by Sir John Borlase Warren, who was
cruising, with seven sail of the line, off Lough Swilly. They engaged,
and, after an action of three hours and forty minutes' duration, the
French three-decker, and three of the frigates, hauled down their
colours, and of the five frigates that then escaped, three were
subsequently captured.

The rebellion in Ireland was now virtually at an end, the rebels were
dispersed, and their leaders accounted for. Still, this result was not
arrived at without a fearful expenditure of treasure and life; it
being estimated that not less than 30,000 lives had been sacrificed.
£1,000,000 was voted by Parliament, as compensation for injury done to
the Loyalists in Ireland, and that sum was reckoned as only being a
third of their actual losses.

On the 1st August of this year was fought the battle of the Nile; the
news of which, however, did not reach the Admiralty until the 2nd
October, and great were the rejoicings, and illuminations, on the 3rd.
With this welcome news, the chronicle of the year may well end.

As far as we can judge, from the lights of history which are left to
us, nothing was going particularly wrong with the national arms, or
the national prosperity, considering we were at war, but the powers,
that were, thought things might possibly go better, if they had a
General Fast, so, on the 1st February, 1799, a proclamation was
issued:--

"George R.--We, taking into Our most serious consideration the just
and necessary War, in which We are engaged, for the Maintenance of the
Independence of Our Crown, for the Defence and Protection of the
Commerce, and of the Rights and Liberties, Civil and Religious, of Our
Subjects, and putting Our trust in Almighty God, that He will
graciously bless Our Arms, both by Sea and Land, have resolved, and
do, by and with the Advice of Our Privy Council, hereby command that a
Publick Fast and Humiliation be observed throughout that part of Our
Kingdom of _Great Britain_ called _England_, Our Dominion of _Wales_,
and _Town of Berwick upon Tweed_, on _Wednesday_, the Twenty-seventh
Day of this instant _February_; that so both We and Our People may
humble Ourselves before Almighty God, in order to obtain Pardon of Our
Sins; and may, in the most devout and solemn Manner, send up Our
Prayers and Supplications to the Divine Majesty, for averting those
Heavy Judgments which Our manifold Sins and Provocations have most
justly deserved; and imploring His Blessing and Assistance on Our
Arms, and for restoring and perpetuating Peace, Safety and Prosperity,
to Us and Our Kingdoms," &c. &c. There were special forms of prayer
for morning, communion, and evening services.

In January, and February, there was much agitation as to the union
with Ireland, to which the Irish Parliament, by small majorities, was
agreeable; but it was reserved till 1st January, 1801, to become an
accomplished fact.

After besieging St. Jean d'Acre for sixty days, in vain, Napoleon
determined to raise the siege, and, on the 20th May, his army began
its return march to Egypt. He threw his heavy artillery into the sea,
not being able to transport it across the desert, and the English had
previously captured his battering train. It need scarcely be said that
there was great rejoicing in England.

Volunteers had sprung up as if by magic, and it was felt that it would
do good, if they received some direct recognition from royalty, and
were reviewed by the King. Accordingly, the time was fixed for the 4th
of June, and the place, Hyde Park. I know I shall be pardoned if I
give a list of the corps who were then reviewed, as so many of the
modern Volunteers must be ignorant that their progenitors were present
on this occasion.

In all, there were 8193 effective men, and the Review was very
successful, the only exception that was taken to it being, that some
of the newly-embodied Corps did not fire with perfect regularity.
Every Londoner is familiar with the statue in Pall Mall, of George
III. on horseback, doffing his cocked hat. Well, that was how he
appeared at this Review, which happened on his birthday. On the 21st,
he, and all the young Princes, inspected some 12,200 men, in a very
curious fashion. The Corps were not brigaded, as in Hyde Park, but
were inspected in their different districts. The Royal party started
at a quarter before 9 A.M., returned to Buckingham House at 6 P.M.,
and then set off for Windsor, a good day's work! especially as it all,
with the exception of the journey to Windsor, had to be done on
horseback. The King, and party, were to have gone to Leman Street,
Whitechapel, to inspect the Shoreditch, Whitechapel, and Mile End
Volunteers, but he could not get so far, so turned up Houndsditch, to
Finsbury. The only refreshment, and rest, the Royal party seem to have
had, was breakfast with the Lord Chancellor, at his house in Upper
Guildford Street, where they remained an hour and a-half.

The history of the remainder of the year is centred in Napoleon
Buonaparte. On 23rd of August, he suddenly left Egypt, affairs in
France requiring his presence there, if he would look after his own
interests. Had he not done so, it is probable that the world would
never have heard so much of him; as it was, he was elected the First
Consul of the three,--Cambacérès, and Le Brun, being his coadjutors.

On the 25th December of this year, Napoleon committed a solecism in
diplomatic etiquette, by writing an autograph letter direct to George
III., pointing out how each nation was wasting its strength and
resources, and suggesting the possibility, and desirability, of peace.
Lord Grenville replied to this letter, through Talleyrand, much to
Napoleon's disgust, and expressed his regret that the English
Government did not yet see its way to enter into negotiations for a
peace, which would not, in all probability, be a lasting one.

This year will close with a report of the number of French prisoners
in England, taken December 31, when they were delivered over to our
Transport Board, the Consular Government refusing to provide for them
any longer.

MEN'S DRESS.


The latter part of the last century was noticeable for the great, and
grave, mutations which took place in masculine attire, and, most
particularly, during the times here treated of. Previously, the wig,
and dress (quaker cut) coat, had long had a successful run, but people
visited the Continent more, especially France, and brought back French
fashions, which at this time were particularly fantastic. The Prince
of Wales, too, delighted in fine dress, and was "_arbiter
elegantiarum_" of his sex. At every levée, and public appearance, his
dress was always expatiated on, and the "gilded youth" of the period,
dressed _up_ to him, and copied his manner, even to his bow.

We, in our days, cannot afford to jeer at the accompanying
illustration, when we see, in the advertisement sheets of some of our
periodicals, men's stays advertised, and even vividly depicted; and,
therefore, we must not throw the first stone of laughter at the
fashions of 1788.

Here we see the transition stage, the modification of the old courtly
wig, with its accompanying powder, and black silk bag for the _queue_,
now only to be seen pinned on to the coat collars of court officials,
and extremely magnificent _major domos_, &c., and, also, we see the
old court dress coat has now taken unto itself a collar, of that
exaggerated description which was so much in vogue during the next
twenty years. Frilled shirts, and ruffles, still existed, and the
curious custom of wearing two watches was the fashion. Here, again,
history has somewhat repeated itself in our modern double watch-chain,
except that now only one watch is worn, the other side guarding a
sovereign purse.

Brighthelmstone or Brighton--beloved of George the Magnificent,
whether as Prince, Regent, or King--was the place where the
fashionable youth congregated, and therefore we may take the following
extract from the _Morning Post_ (the _doyen_ of the Daily Press) of
18th September, 1788:--

     "Brighton Dress.

     "The fashionable bathing dress, at Brighton, is chiefly a pair of
     _buff trousers_, with a slight jacket.

     "This is adopted by all the young men of the place, and a number
     of idle, sauntering _land lubbers_ meet the eye every morning on
     the Steyne, that one cannot help wishing for a sturdy _pressgang_
     to give them useful employment, or at least keep them out of
     mischief.

     "After breakfast they are accoutred for the sports of the field.

     "The _sporting dress_ is a _brown jacket_, with a multiplicity of
     pockets, on each side, that reaches from the bottom to the top,
     so that, from this appearance, it is somewhat difficult to
     determine which the fashionable tribe most resemble--a set of
     grooms, or a company of smugglers.

     "When the dinner hour arrives, after these sprightly and heroic
     gentlemen have '_slain their thousands, and ten thousands_,'
     according to their own account, in the field, with as little
     _winking and blinking_ as Major Sturgeon himself, they then
     attire themselves in order to enjoy the pleasures of the table,
     and, however deranged they may afterwards be by convivial excess,
     they march or _stagger_ away to _the Rooms_, as circumstances may
     determine, and entertain the Ladies with _elegant_ and _decent_
     gallantry."

[Illustration: The Prince's Bow "Monstrous like the Prince! The very
bow, demme!"]

[Illustration: Tight Lacing.--1788. "These tight Stays will be the
death of me!"]

About this time flourished that curious being, the "_Macaroni_," but
most of his portraits are evidently such gross caricatures, that I
have not cared to reproduce them. I have been compelled to draw upon
the satirical prints of the period, as a future historian would take
the pictures from _Punch_, if he wanted to hit the passing folly of
the day; but we must not forget that the satirical prints of the last
century, did not their spiriting so gently as our modern
caricaturists, but exaggerated in every way, in facial expression, and
in costume.

The following brace of _Macaronis_ is taken from a print of the "_Mock
Duel, or a trip to Flanders_," 26th May, 1789: and, although the
costume is scrupulously correct, yet one can hardly help thinking that
the designer of the wig, which was typical of the genus, has somewhat
"drawn upon his imagination for his facts." The name _Macaroni_ was
applied, in derision, to those youths who had made the _Grand Tour_,
and were fond, on their return, of shewing off their superior graces,
and extolling the polished manners, and superior civilization, of the
countries they had visited. In those days you were nothing unless
classical. Modern languages were rarely taught, Science was all but
unknown, Latin and Greek were the chief branches of education, and
rich men were keen collectors of everything classical, marble statues
and busts, bronzes, and coins--so Italy was naturally the bourne of
these travelled youths, and John Bull, who then was, in the aggregate,
a very stay-at-home animal, derided them, when they came back, with
the epithet _Macaroni_, an elegant title derived from the popular
Italian dish.

The home-keeping youths imitated their brethren as well as they could,
but it was at a very humble distance, and their dress, though
partially modelled on that of their confrères, was much exaggerated,
and did not display such simplicity or good taste.--John Bull had a
name ready for him; a home-manufactured Macaroni was "a Jessamy."

These _Jessamies_ were, like the modern _Mashers_, effeminate, and
comparatively harmless beings--entirely taken up with the
contemplation of their external appearance, and the attempted
subjugation of the other sex.

See the following quotation from the _Morning Post_ 4th July
1789:--"There is not a man in the nation, no not even Lord Effingham,
who bestows so much time and attention in rendering the external
appearance of his head, elegant in the extreme, than the Earl of
Scarborough. It is said that his Lordship keeps six French frizeurs,
who have nothing else to do than dress his hair. Lord Effingham keeps
only Five!!!"

The _Jessamies_, however, were only one class among the youth of the
time, and I fear, by far the smallest. The majority were what we now
should term "fast." Animal spirits in young men must have vent
somehow.

There were then no rowing, cycles, or other means of getting rid of
the superfluous energy they possessed. Men's social habits were not
at all of a "blue riband" nature, and, after dinner, the bottle
circulated freely. So those who, like Charles Reade's description of
modern athletic young men, knew "only one language, and lived
principally in the open air," naturally became either "A choice
Spirit," "A Buck," or "A Blood," descendants of the "Hectors,"
"Muns," "Titiretus," "Scourers," and "Mohocks"--men that hustled
honest folk, sang roaring, maudlin, filthy songs--men from whom no
woman was safe; who, armed with bludgeons, and going in company in
large numbers, boxed the watch, set the constables at defiance, and
made night hideous with their brawls and shouting.

[Illustration: Macaronis (From the Mock Duel, 1789.)]

Far be it from me to say that the whole youth of this age could be
classed either in one, or other, of these two categories; there were
good young men who probably "always came home to their tea," well
dressed, well read, well mannered--such as "A Smart."

As a rule, even now-a-days, a man when in the country, very seldom, or
never, carries an umbrella: to a Londoner it is part of his costume.
In Anne's reign the use of the umbrella was strictly set apart for the
softer sex, and then only for those whose avocations compelled them to
be out, whatever the weather. As Gay says in his "_Trivia_"--

  "The tuck'd-up sempstress walks with hasty strides,
  While streams run down her oil'd umbrella's sides."

But for men, fie! he must be an effeminate coxcomb who would carry
one. Hear what fun was made of him (_Female Tatler_, December
12):--"The Young Gentleman belonging to the Custom House, that for
fear of rain borrowed the umbrella at Will's Coffee House in Cornhill
of the _Mistress_, is hereby advertised that to be dry from head to
foot on the like occasion, he shall be welcome to the _Maid's
Pattens_."

One John Macdonald, a footman, who wrote his own biography, helps us
to fix a date when the use of them, by men, was so rare as to make the
user singular. He says that he had "a fine silk umbrella, which he
brought from Spain; but he could not, with any comfort to himself, use
it, the people calling out 'Frenchman! why don't you get a coach?'"
However, he "persisted for three months, till they took no further
notice of this novelty. Foreigners began to use theirs, and then the
English." Macdonald wrote in 1778. Jonas Hanway, the philanthropist,
who had travelled much in Persia and the East, is said to have been
the first Englishman who habitually carried an umbrella whilst walking
in the street. He died in 1786.

That it was not in general use in the year 1790, is evidenced by the
somewhat sneering title of a "Rain Beau," or one that was afraid of a
drop of rain. This illustration shews several modifications of fashion
besides the use of the umbrella. The cocked hat had gone out--and the
galling yoke of the "chimney pot" was being inaugurated. As yet it was
limp, of felt, but there is the hideous head covering that has
martyrised at least three generations.

Then we cannot but notice that the hair has lost all trace of the
wig--and is allowed to be worn "_au naturel_." A huge cravat swathes
the throat, the coat is cut shorter, and more fly-away than hitherto,
that knee breeches are disappearing, and pantaloons coming in, to be
in their turn superseded by the modern trouser. Lastly, the term
_Macaroni_, or _Jessamy_, is replaced by _Beau_--which will soon have
to give way to _Dandy_.

Jimmy Lincum Feadle shows us the Beau of 1791. Here the fashion
is evidently imported from France--loud coloured striped
coat--pantaloons, boots and all. The French Revolution was hastening
on, rapidly, to its culmination, and, the younger Whigs, before the
time came when they were utterly disgusted by the brutal excesses of
the French, copied the dress of the Revolutionary party.

[Illustration: A Jessamy.--1790.]

[Illustration: A Choice Spirit.]

[Illustration: A Buck.]

The accompanying illustration will show how far they succeeded. There
is an elaborately studied negligence about the coat, and a height
about the hat, which could never be of native production, whilst the
bludgeon must have belonged to some "Merveilleux," (the class whom
Bonaparte so cordially detested), and have been imported direct from
Paris. The supercilious look, and the mincing gait, are warranted
truly Parisian, and I have very little doubt but that Isaac Cruikshank
sketched him from the life.

The term "a Crop," is indicative of Revolutionary and Republican
sympathies. Lucius Junius Brutus, and all the ancient Romans, wore
their hair cut short--and so we must needs copy them, and have a
revolution in hair cutting, just to show the outer world what our
thoughts are on the present position of political parties. The
elaborate hair of the _Macaroni_ or the _Jessamy_, or even the
negligent, but natural _chevelure_ of the _Beau_, would not suit
Republican simplicity, and, as in our own Commonwealth, the men of the
Republic cropped their heads, as a testimony against their political
opponents, so did they in 1791. The Duke of Bedford, especially,
attracted public attention, by having his hair cut short, and many are
the allusions to him, with respect to it, in the public prints.

But with 1792 came another change of fashion, of which we get two
views, back and front, and as they are by a lady (Miss Keate), they
are probably not caricatured.

Here we see a return to a more natural style of dress, the colours of
which, in "_Neck or Nothing_," are well chosen, and very becoming. Of
course the awful cravat is of white cambric or muslin, and he wears a
pink underwaistcoat, white over-waistcoat, and knee-breeches, a
mulberry-coloured coat, and blue and white stockings; hair powdered.

"A back view of the cape" is not so felicitous as regards colour,
being somewhat "_prononcé_." The coat is green, breeches yellow,
necktie yellow, stockings grey, powdered hair, and a liberal supply of
powder on the back of the coat.

In order to keep this hair powder on the hair, it was necessary to
saturate it with some kind of grease, even if only a tallow dip, or
rushlight, were used; but an advertisement in the _Times_, of 7th
February 1793, gives us some notion as to the antiquity of Bears'
Grease, which must have been undoubtedly genuine, if the last
paragraph can be taken as a fact:--

     "JUST KILLED, an extraordinary fine Fat Russian Bear, at Ross's
     Ornamental Hair and Perfumery Warehouse, No. 119 Bishopsgate
     Street (late Vickery's), three doors from the London Tavern.

     "The excellent virtue which the fat of Bears possesses, has been
     experienced by thousands of both sexes, and of all Ages, in this
     Metropolis. To those who have used the real Bears' Grease, it is
     evident no Grease whatever beside, retains its moisture so long
     upon the head, it being the only thing possible to make the Hair
     grow thick and long, recover it after illness, prevent it
     falling off, or turning grey, during life: being the most
     efficacious remedy for making the Hair grow on Horses' knees
     when broken or chafed.

     "It is sold at 1s. per ounce, or 16s. the pound, to be seen cut
     off the Animal in the presence of the purchaser."

_Apropos_ of "cropping," take the following skit from the _Times_,
January 21, 1794:--

     "Sir Robert Mackworth is at Bath, and seems to be no otherways
     distinguished than by the particularity of his equipage: he
     drives four horses of different colours in his phaeton, which has
     four wheels painted to correspond with the colours of the horses:
     in the midst of his badge of distinction, the bloody hand, is the
     figure of 4, which he explains in this way, four in hand. The
     motto 'This is the Tippy.' If anything can add to the folly of
     the whole it is that he intends to crop four opposite ears of his
     horses, to make room for four monstrous roses, of different
     colours, to match."

The Court dresses which the Nobility and Gentry then wore, were
magnificent, and the following are only a few, taken as an example,
from the _Times_, June 4, 1794:--

    "KING'S BIRTHDAY.

     "Yesterday, being the anniversary of the King's birthday, when
     His Majesty entered into the 57th year of his age, a Drawing-Room
     was held in the afternoon, and, at night, a Ball at St. James'.
     The Gentlemen's dresses were in general embroidered silks and
     silk cloths: but one half were dressed in Regimentals.

     "His Majesty, as usual on his own Birthday, was in a plain suit
     of clothes. The best dressed Gentlemen whom we saw at Court, and
     indeed their dresses were very generally noticed for their taste
     and splendour, were--


     "Mr. Skeffington.

     "A brown spotted silk coat and breeches, with a white silk
     waistcoat richly embroidered with silver, stones, and shades of
     silk: the design was large baskets of silver and stones, filled
     with bouquets of roses, jonquilles, &c., the _ensemble_ producing
     a beautiful and splendid effect.


     "The Hon. Thomas Anson.

     "A striped silk coat and breeches, with a white silk waistcoat,
     richly embroidered with white silk and dentelle: the waistcoat
     embroidered to match the coat.


     "The Hon. Mr. Paget.

     "A brown and blue striped silk coat and breeches, with a white
     silk waistcoat, the suit elegantly embroidered with silver,
     stones, and bouquets of flowers.


     "Duke of Queensberry.

     "A striped, and spotted silk coat, and breeches, with diamond
     buttons, with a white silk waistcoat embroidered with silver,
     stones, and silk.


     "Marquis of Lorn.

     "A blue and brown striped silk cloth coat, and breeches, with a
     white silk waistcoat, embroidered with dentelle, and shades of
     silk.


     "Lord Willoughby de Broke.

     "A dark olive spotted silk coat, and breeches, with a white silk
     waistcoat, the suit richly embroidered in silver, coloured
     stones, and shades of silk."

Anent Hair Powder, we have the following, which may be a libel:--

     "As a Frenchman cannot exist without a powdered head, and meal
     being so dear in France, the _Beaux_ are under the necessity of
     wearing _powdered whiting_. Rouge is plenty enough, that article
     not being put in requisition: the ladies therefore, as usual,
     wear their faces under _red masks_. They go to bed as blooming as
     _Sol_, when he retires to the _Lap of Thetis_: and rise as pale
     as _Cynthia_, in her nocturnal visits to the earth."--(_Times,
     Nov. 29, 1794._)

     "_Mother of Pearl buttons_ are likely to take the lead in the
     fashionable world, as they are both beautiful and ornamental, as
     well as durable and economical: on the contrary, those made of
     steel, and other metals, soon rust, and want frequent
     cleaning."--(_Times, Dec. 16, 1794._)

[Illustration: Jimmy Lincum Feadle--1791.]

[Illustration: A Scaramouch.]

By the 35 Geo. III., c. 49--a Duty was laid on Hair powder--and "the
Crops," besides their (as we should term it) Radical tendencies, were
extra unpopular among the Tories, because they evaded the Hair Powder
duty, by wearing none:--

     "A numerous club has been formed in Lambeth, called the _Crop
     Club_, every member of which, on his entrance, is obliged to have
     his head docked as close as the Duke of Bridgewater's old bay
     coach-horses. This assemblage is instituted for the purpose of
     opposing, or rather evading, the tax on powdered
     heads."--(_Times, April 14, 1795._)

     "The following Noblemen and Gentlemen were of the party with the
     Duke of Bedford at Woburn Abbey, when a general cropping, and
     combing out of hair powder took place: Lord W. Russell, Lord
     Villiers, Lord Paget, &c., &c. They entered into an engagement to
     forfeit a sum of money if any of them wore their hair tied, or
     powdered, within a certain period. Many Noblemen and Gentlemen in
     the county of Bedford have since followed the example: it has
     become general with the Gentry in Hampshire, and the Ladies have
     left off wearing powder."--(_Times, Sept. 25, 1795._)

     "The Bedford Crops.--Something has at last fallen from this party
     to entertain the Public. We hope they will find their heads
     cooler for this salutary operation. Dr. Willis[3] is of opinion,
     that more than one of them ought to have been _shaved_. If the
     _Shavees_ think by publishing their names they will gain
     proselytes, till their absurdity is lost in the crowd, they are
     mistaken. Can it be supposed that a few drunken persons in a
     frolic, will be followed by the sober part of the people of
     England?

          [Footnote 3: Dr. Willis was a Clergyman, who turned
          Physician, and his specialty was treatment of the insane. He
          attended George III. in his mental alienation, and was
          handsomely rewarded.]

     "The new Crop is called the _Bedford Level_.

     "An Irish Member once proposed in the House of Commons of that
     Country, to encourage the breed of _Crops_. We believe no such
     proposition is likely to be renewed upon the present
     occasion."--(_Times, Sept. 29, 1795._)

     "The price of hair is considerably fallen. The wig-makers declare
     people are so afraid of having anything from the _crops_, that
     they can't sell a _single peruke_."--(_Times, Nov. 23, 1795._)

We get a curious insight into the manners of the young men of that
day, in the following cutting from the _Times, Dec. 14, 1795_:--

     "If the young men of the present day have not much wit in their
     heads, they have it at least in their _hats_. Amongst the
     pleasantries we have seen in this way, are the following: 'Not
     yours.'--'Hands off'--'No vermin'--and 'Rip this as you would a
     hot potato'--and other charming sallies of _refined_ and
     _elegant_ vivacity. But the wittiest linings are the political
     ones: Upon a table, the other day we observed one perfectly
     clean, in which was written '_Avaunt, Guinea Pig!_' and on the
     lining, in a very powdery hat, that lay in a window in the same
     room, were inscribed the two following monosyllables, '_Off
     Crop_.'"

     "A Crop, who had begun to let his hair grow, was accused of
     aristocracy, and had his head shaved in the form of a horse-shoe
     at Wooburn, by a verdict of his Peers."--(_Times, Dec. 30,
     1795._)

Clothes were dear in those days, as the following Tailor's bill
shows--because we must reckon the value of money then at more than
double what it is now:--

     "Address to the Public.--Those Gentlemen who are inclined to a
     solicitude to their interests, the undermentioned prices will be
     found to be highly advantageous:--

[Illustration: Aping the Frenchman]

Among the eccentricities of Costume, was a Coat devised by the then
Earl Spencer. He made a bet that he would cut off the tails of the
coat which he then wore, and appear in public in a jacket, which,
within a week, should be the fashion. He did so, and won his bet.
Gillray caricatured the Earl, in a picture 17th May, 1792. Earl
Spencer wears (in the picture) a blue spencer red coat with brass
buttons, yellow trousers, and blue and white stockings. The
"Threadpaper" has a green coat and grey stockings. Both have plenty of
powder on the backs of their coats.

The fashion is alluded to in a paragraph in the _Times_ of 16th May
1795, and the "livery" therein alluded to is a covert satire on the
"Windsor Uniform," which has been the semi-court dress, from George
III.'s time to our own. It is said to have been taken from the uniform
of a Berkshire Volunteer Cavalry Regiment, of which the King was
Colonel:--

     "The general fashion of wearing _Spencers_, reminds us of a wager
     laid by Lord _March_, who betted several years ago a considerable
     sum with some of his friends, that he would be able to introduce
     to general imitation, the most humiliating fashion he could think
     of. Accordingly he appeared several days successively about the
     Royal Exchange, dressed like a livery servant. The livery
     consisted of a blue coat, with crimson collar and cuffs; and he
     gained the wager."--(_Times, May 16, 1795._)

The accompanying illustration by W. Hanlon (11th July 1795) is, of
course, a caricature, but it is intended to show the eccentricities of
dress, in which the "Crops" indulged.

  THE BOND STREET LOUNGE.

  AN IMPROMPTU.

  _Modo vir, modo foemina.--Virgil._

  (_Times, January 7th, 1796._)

  When men in _Petty-Coats_ appear,
  No wonder Wives the breeches wear:
  Assuming manners quite robust,
  Game, swear, drive, box, or _take a thrust_.
  But happier far would be the case,
  Were each to keep their proper place:
  The fair ones wear the female dress,
  And men adorn their persons less;
  For such the fashion of the day,
  They make it difficult to say,
  Whether the _pretty things_ we meet,
  Parading through their fav'rite street,
  A Male or Female we may call,
  Their shapes are so equivocal.      V.

  London Coffee-House,
  _January 7th, 1796_.

     "The high kick of fashion is to wear only one spur, like a
     postillion, and to have an assortment of long whips tied up
     behind the curricle, in case of wearing them all out in Bond St.,
     during a ride in the morning."--(_Times, August 3, 1796._)

We need not go very far, any day in Winter, to see the young men of
our day, doing the same thing, and looking extremely "Norse"--they
never telling of the Chamois leather vests they wear.

     "One of the latest roads to fame that any of our young men of
     _ton_ have discovered, is to wrap their bodies carefully in
     flannel under the shirt, and to keep the coat and waistcoat quite
     open, to show the strength of their constitution, and set the
     snow at defiance."--(_Times, January 2, 1797._)

     "Margate is already beginning to be crowded, as usual, with all
     sorts, and for all purposes, some to undo, and some to be undone;
     wives to leave their husbands, and misses to procure theirs. Some
     tradesmen gone down to get, and others to get rid of their money:
     old maids to display tresses not their own, and the young men to
     show off Brutus heads, when the grand point is, whether their's
     or their type's in Ross's shop window have the most brains:
     perhaps there cannot be situations more calculated to display
     what Shenstone terms 'The various ways of dressing a calf's
     head.'"--(_Times, August 5, 1799._)

     "Milan, _July 15th_.--In order to a due execration of the
     licentious dresses which our Government has forbidden, the
     executioner of this place, with his wife, appeared in the public
     walk. He was _elegantly_ dressed, with his head _à la Brutus_, a
     large cravat which, concealing the chin, reached to the mouth:
     long pantaloons, hanging loose: and shoes, the points of which
     were a finger's length. His wife was quite _à la
     guillotine_--naked shoulders, neck and arms."--(_Times, August 5,

     "Our emaciated beaux in their quilted lappelles and stuffed
     sleeves are like a dry walnut in a great shell."--(_Times, August
     20, 1799._)

This paragraph is easily explained by a reference to the two
accompanying engravings.

These peculiar garments were called "Jean Debry," after the French
statesman of that name, who was born in 1760, died 1834. He was a
somewhat prominent figure in the French Revolution, and, as his name
was at this time much in men's mouths, he was made the peg on which to
hang a coat.--"A French Taylor fitting John Bull with a Jean de Bry,"
is by Gillray, 18th November 1799, and, although a gross Caricature,
fairly represents the garment. The tailor is in ecstasy with the fit.
"Aha! dere my friend, I fit you to de life! dere is Liberté! no tight
Aristocrat Sleeves, to keep from you vat you like! a ha! begar, dere,
he only want von leetle National Cockade to make look quite a la mode
de Paris!"

John Bull surveys himself in the looking-glass, grumbling at his
change of costume. "Liberty! quotha! why, zounds, I can't move my arms
at all! for all it looks woundy big! Oh! damn your French Alamodes,
they give a man the same Liberty as if he was in the Stocks! give me
my old Coat again, say I, if it is a little out of Elbows!"

     "The items of a fashionable Taylor's bill are not a little
     curious at present:--Ditto, to pasteboard for your back; ditto,
     to buckram for your cape; ditto, for wool for your shoulders,
     and cotton for your chest. Shakespeare talks of Nature's
     Journeymen who make men indifferently, but our Journeymen Taylors
     make their customers of any form and dimensions they think
     proper."--(_Times, Sept. 6, 1799._)

       *       *       *       *       *

     Modern Costume.

     "The _Long-toed Shoe_ which now figures in Bond Street was
     regulated by an Act of Parliament so long ago as the reign of
     Edward III. No person under the rank of a Knight then had a right
     to advance his toe more than four inches beyond the natural
     extremity.... If ever, in some centuries to come, the little hat,
     stuffed coat, and long-toed shoe of a modern fine Gentleman
     should be discovered in some Museum of Antiquities, or to survive
     upon the Stage, they would no doubt give birth to many learned
     doubts and extraordinary speculations. By the size of a pair of
     modern _Leather Breeches_, it will naturally be inferred that the
     present race of men were of a Colossal form. When we suppose in
     the same collection a pair of our Hussar Boots to have escaped
     the ravage of time, will not our descendants enquire by what
     descending scale of rapid decay and diminution mankind is
     hastening into the pigmy state, or the dwarf? Our Coats too, in
     which the Cotton, the Wool, the Tow, and all the _et cetera_ of
     quilting, which now form one half of our bulk, will then only
     seem the remains of the art of the virtuoso: and the curious
     stuffing he has devised to represent the gigantic proportions of
     the wearer. It ought, however, to be known, for the honour of
     this commercial nation, that it is to the spirit of justice and
     liberality of our tradesmen, that this extraordinary augmentation
     of our bulk is to be attributed. Having doubled the price of
     every article upon us, they have very fairly given us double
     measure, both in our Coats, Boots, and Breeches. The Hatter, I am
     sorry to say, is not entitled to the same commendation, for he
     has of late years perpetually diminished and circumscribed the
     little brim he allows us, in the exact proportion that he has
     advanced the price of it, so that the scarcity of felt is like
     that of bread, the less you have, the more you are to pay for it.
     I paid a guinea and a quarter for the last I bought, and I was
     ingenuously told that by the time a hat cost two guineas, it
     would exactly be the size and the weight of one. All these
     tradesmen, in a fairer sense than the _hatters_, make the _most_
     of their customers: but he to whom the nobler part of man, the
     head, is committed, diminishes in the most scandalous manner the
     protection it requires...."--(_Times, Sept. 20, 1799._)

WOMEN'S DRESS.


The earliest Lady's fashion book I can find in the British Museum, is
"The Lady's Monthly Museum," &c. "By a Society of Ladies,"--and it was
published in 1799--or just the last year of which this book takes
cognizance. But, luckily, the satirical prints supply the want, in a
great measure, although they are somewhat exaggerated. From them we
are able to see pictorially what might be hard to describe, and may be
perfectly certain that they represent "the very last thing out" at
their date of Publication. If, then, we have very little written about
female attire, in 1788, and the next year, or two, we must be content
with viewing the _veræ effigies_ of the belles of that time.

Brighton, of course, was the fashionable watering-place, for there
were the life and gaiety of the young Court, in contradistinction to
the humdrum existence led by the King, Queen, and younger branches of
the Royal Family, at Weymouth. So it will be interesting to know their
habits at this famous sea-side resort. The _Morning Post_, 18th
September 1788, has the following:--

     "The Ladies have no particular dress for the morning, but
     _huddle_ away to the bathing place, in close caps, and _gipsey
     bonnets_, so that they look like a set of wandering
     _fortune-tellers_, who have just had the opportunity of pillaging
     the contents of a _frippery warehouse_, with which they had
     bedecked themselves in haste.

     "It is to be remarked that the ladies do not atone for the
     negligence of the morning, by neatness, and elegance, during the
     rest of the day, but _shuffle on something_ by dinner time,
     covering themselves with an enormous _nondescript_ bonnet,
     which, to the confusion of all order, they afterwards think a
     proper garb for the Assembly."

In doors, the dresses were not so _outré_, as we see by the two
illustrations taken from "The School for Scandal," 1st August 1788.

That ladies copied the eccentricities of male attire, and made them
their own, we have proof in this cutting from the _Morning Post_, 15th
January 1789:--

     "Among other fashions lately introduced from Paris is the brace
     of gold watch chains now sported by our fashionable females. Some
     economical husbands may wish their wives were less imitative."

The portrait of the Duchess of York (the Princess Frederique,
Charlotte, Ulrique, Catherine, of Prussia, married to the Duke,
November 1791), shews us the indoor dress of a lady of rank in 1792.
She had a remarkably small foot, and many were the delineations of her
shoes--actual size, &c.

Of all curious freaks of fashion the following is the most
incomprehensible, yet it doubtless obtained:--

     "The fashion of dressing, at present, is to appear _prominent_,
     and the stays are made accordingly. This is holding out a wish to
     be thought in a thriving way, even without the authority of the
     _Arches Court_ of Canterbury--something in the French way--a
     philosophical desire to be _conspicuously great_ with MISCHIEF,
     without any regard to law or reason. The idea was at first sent
     forward by a few _dropsical_ Ladies."--(_Times, March 25, 1793._)

       *       *       *       *       *

     "The _Wapping Land-ladies_ are all at the very pinnacle of the
     fashion. Nature has given them prominences which far out-picture
     the false mountains at the West end of the town. It is not only
     the fashion of appearing six months gone, that prevails with the
     ladies--but that of not having any waists, so that, even with
     their prominences, they may be called--_No-body_." (_Times, April
     15, 1793._)

A series of prints were published which represent the amount of
indebtedness, ladies were under, to Art, to repair the ravages made by
Nature.

No. 1 shows us most graphically the "levée au matin."--Tears drop from
the eyeless socket--a yawn discloses the want of teeth, and, the
handkerchief, tied round the head, which does service for a night cap,
tells a sad tale of baldness.

In No. 2 the defect of nature is being remedied by the insertion of a
glass eye--which the subsequent illustrations prove to be very
effective.

No. 3 shows the triumph of the hairdresser's art; and, certainly, it
adds much to the ladies personal attractions.

In No. 4 false teeth are being inserted, to replace those, of which
unkind nature has robbed her.

No. 5 applies the bloom of youth to the faded cheek,--a bloom that
never yet deceived any one.

In No. 6 the Belle has finished her toilette, and is now prepared to
break all hearts.

This series is attributed to Rowlandson--and, most probably, is his
work. It is called "Six Stages of making a face.--Dedicated with
respect to Lady Archer," of which lady we shall hear more anon under
the head of "Gaming."

Waists, as may have been perceived by the last two, or three
examples, have been gradually disappearing, until, as in "The
Scarecrow," they became practically _nil_. High feathers were
beginning to come in, and, in addition to the "panache," was worn a
curious thing made of straw, very much resembling the "bristle plume"
which used to be worn in the Shakos of our Engineers, and Artillery.
In imitation of the men, the ladies' throats were swathed in
voluminous wrappers.

With very low bodices, and very high waists, came very scanty
clothing, with an absence of petticoat, a fashion which left very
little of the form to the imagination. I do not say that our English
Belles went to the extent of some of their French sisters, of having
their muslin dresses put on damp--and holding them tight to their
figures till they dried--so as absolutely to mould them to their form,
or that they ever discarded stockings, and went to balls with bare
feet, and only wearing sandals, having on but the lightest of
classical clothing--but their clothes were of the scantiest, and we
shall find that, as year succeeded year, this fashion developed, if
one can call diminution of clothing, development. Men made fun of it,
_vide_ the following from the _Times_, 12th August, 1794:--"Amongst
prudent papas, the favourite toast at this time is 'The present
fashion of our wives and daughters,' viz. _No Waste_."

There was a very pretty song, called "Shepherds, I have lost my love,
Have you seen my Anna?"--and this was parodied as follows--the music
being the same as the original song:--

[Song: SHEPHERDS, I HAVE LOST MY WAIST.

  Shep-herds, I have lost my waist, Have you seen my bo - - dy?

  Sac - ri - ficed to mo-dern taste, I'm quite a hod - dy dod - - dy.

  For fashion I that part for - sook Where sages place the bel - - - ly;

  'Tis gone, and I have not a nook For cheesecake, tart, or jel - ly.]

  "Never shall I see it more,
    Till, common sense returning,
  My body to my legs restore,
    Then I shall cease from mourning,
  Folly and fashion do prevail
    To such extremes among the fair,
  A woman's only top and tail,
    The body's banish'd God knows where!'

[Illustration: A Scarecrow--1793.]

[Illustration: Following the Fashion.]

That a fashion may become one person, and not another, is peculiarly
exemplified by the two following pictures by Gillray, 9th December,
1794, both called "Following the Fashion:"--

  "St. James's giving the Ton, | "Cheapside aping the Mode,
   a Soul without a Body.      |  a Body without a Soul."

       *       *       *       *       *

The tax on Hair powder was much objected to; people had been used,
for a long time, to grease, and powder their hair and wigs; and, when
the duty of a Guinea per head was passed, many left off using it. The
illustration "Leaving off Powder, or a Frugal family saving a
Guinea," was doubtless the fact in many a family. The man, in the
coloured engraving, with his "crop," to our eyes does not look so
singular, as the lady, with her "fausse chevelure" unpowdered looks so
bad, that, no wonder, ladies reverted to their own locks, as we see
in future illustrations. So also shall we see the "Cap" of the
period, the length of which is most amusingly portrayed.

The wearing of false hair is of very early origin, inasmuch as we
possess, in the British Museum, an early Egyptian wig, and, in every
age, we find women supplementing their natural attractions, by the
addition of some one else's hair. Here is a Hair-dresser's
advertisement of 1795, wherein is not only mentioned the price, &c.,
of hair, but shows the antiquity of the "Chignon," which, otherwise,
many might think of modern date.

     "TO THE LADIES.--T. BOWMAN respectfully acquaints the Ladies,
     that he has entirely removed his Shop and Manufactory to No. 102
     New Bond Street, near Brook Street. Firmly relying upon the
     future favors and recommendation of his old Customers, and
     trusting to the superiority of his articles, he has augmented his
     stock of Chignons or Braids, from 600 to near 1000, in 14 shades
     (not 20) of brown colours, besides Auburns, Flaxens, &c., and in
     8 lengths (not 50) at 10s., 14s., £1 £1 1s., £1 11s. 6d., £2 2s.,
     £3 3s., £4 4s., and £6 6s. each. Any colour matched in all the
     sizes in a minute. T. Bowman formerly gave a description of his
     Braids, but that has been copied by another and applied unto his
     own, without their possessing one requisite for which Bowman's
     Braids have been distinguished: and, not contented with slaying
     by twenties, he now kills by fifties. Bravo! Captain Boabdill,
     fifty more, kill them!!! As for the shades, what with Chinese
     hairs, mixing, and dying, he may have them (as he says) of every
     tint, but for real, natural, Brown colours. T. Bowman, with by
     far the greatest stock in the Kingdom, cannot make more than 14
     shades; he can only challenge a comparison, and pledges himself
     to make good every assertion he has at any time made. His
     Brunswick fillets, an entire new and elegant article, with curls
     complete, fit either for morning or full dress, from 7s. 6d. to
     10s. 6d. each, with Tetes, Borders, and every article in
     ornamental Hair, much cheaper than at any shop in town: having a
     very large stock, and dealing for ready money only, he has as yet
     made no advance on his old prices, although the price of hair is
     now double. Country orders, with money, or reference, duly
     observed. Chignons, &c., changed when not approved of, if not
     powdered."--(_Times, June 22, 1795._)

       *       *       *       *       *

     "Corsettes about six inches long, and a slight _buffon_ tucker of
     two inches high, are now the only defensive _paraphernalia_ of
     our fashionable Belles, between the necklace and the
     apron-strings.--(_Times, June 24, 1795._)

     "The annual City Assemblies, from the glowing colours which
     decorate the _belles_, may be now fairly styled _red-hot
     balls_."--(_Times, Dec. 29, 1795._)

But Feathers were now used on the shafts levelled at the vagaries of
Fashion.

     "At all elegant Assemblies, there is a room set apart for the
     lady visitants to put their feathers on, as it is impossible to
     wear them in any carriage with a top to it. The lustres are also
     removed upon this account, and the doors are carried up to the
     height of the ceiling. A well-dressed Lady, who nods with
     dexterity, can give a friend a little tap upon the shoulder
     across the room, without incommoding the dancers. The Ladies'
     feathers are now generally carried in the sword-case, at the back
     of the carriage."--(_Times, Dec. 29, 1795._)

       *       *       *       *       *

     "A young lady, _only ten feet high_, was overset in one of the
     late gales of wind, in Portland Place, and the upper mast of her
     feather blown upon Hampstead Hill."

     "The _maroon fever_ has been succeeded by a very odd kind of
     light-headedness, which the physicians call the _ptereo mania_,
     or feather folly."

     "The Ladies now wear feathers exactly of their own length, so
     that a woman of fashion is twice as long upon her feet as in her
     bed."--(_Times, Dec. 30, 1795._)

       *       *       *       *       *

     "We saw a feather in Drury Lane Theatre, yesterday evening, that
     cost _ten_ guineas. We should have thought the _whole goose_ not
     worth the money."--(_Times, Jan. 6, 1796._)

Here is a contrivance by which "A Modern Belle going to the Rooms or
Balls" can go fully dressed, with her feathers fixed:--

     "There is to be seen in Gt. Queen Street, a Coach upon a new
     construction. The Ladies set in this well, and see between the
     spokes of the wheels. With this contrivance the fair proprietor
     is able to go quite dressed to her visits, her feathers being
     only a yard and a half high."--(_Times, Jan. 22, 1796._)

The freaks of fashion, towards the latter end of 1795, are most
curious. "Waggoner's frocks," and the "Petticoat" dress, are singular
illustrations of feminine taste. This latter is noticed in a paragraph
in the _Times_, 27th Oct. 1795. "The present fashionable dress is the
most simple imaginable. The petticoat is pinned to the Cravat, and the
arms come out at the pocket holes."

     "The only new fashions that remain for our modern belles are
     certainly puzzling and difficult. There can be nothing new, but
     going either dressed or naked."--(_Times, Jan. 27, 1796._)

The following paragraph from the _Times_ refers not only to the
general absence of dress, but also to the famous (or infamous) Miss
Chudleigh, a maid of Honour to the Queen, afterwards Duchess of
Kingston, and tells the story of how the Princess of Wales, wife of
Frederick (father of George III.), rebuked her for her nakedness.

     "One night, when the late Duchess of Kingston appeared at
     Ranelagh in a dress which may be compared with the undress of
     some of our fashionable _belles_, a _handkerchief_ was thrown to
     her, not from the Prince, but the Princess of Wales."--(_Times,
     March 5, 1796._)

"Lady Godiva's Rout, or Peeping Tom spying out Pope Joan," is by
Gillray, 12th March 1796, and is a scathing satire on the extremely
_decolletée_, and diaphonous, dresses of the time. The fair one, whose
uncovered bosom so attracts the candle snuffer, is intended to
represent Lady Georgiana Gordon, afterwards Duchess of Bedford.

"High Change in Bond Street" is by Gillray (27th March 1796), and is a
most amusing caricature of the then prevalent fashions both of men and
women. The "Bond Street Loungers," are depicted to perfection.

     "At the late Fandango Ball in Dublin, a certain Lady of Fashion
     appeared in the following very whimsical dress:--Flesh coloured
     pantaloons, over which was a gauze petticoat, tucked up at each
     side in drapery, so that both thighs could be seen; the binding
     of the petticoat was tied round the neck, and her arms were
     through the pocket holes. Her head dress was a man's pearl
     coloured stocking, the foot hanging down at the back of the head
     like a lappet, and in the heel of the stocking was stuck a large
     diamond pin, the _tout ensemble_ not less novel, than
     ludicrous."--(_Times, May 26, 1796._)

       *       *       *       *       *

     "_Whalebone-Veils_ are worn by all the fashionable dames at
     Weymouth. This invention is evidently borrowed from the head of a
     one horse chaise."--(_Times, August 27, 1796._)

       *       *       *       *       *

     "_High heels_ are once more the rage; there is, however, no
     scarcity of _flats_. During the reign of the _flat sole_, the
     Ladies make more faux-pas than ever, so that we need entertain no
     apprehensions for them, if they chuse to get upon stilts. What
     with high heels and high feathers, the _better half_ of many an
     honest man is just one third part of herself."--(_Times, August
     27, 1796._)

       *       *       *       *       *

     "Fashion would be its own murderer, if it were to be constant
     and permanent. The last year's dress seems to abdicate entirely;
     even the waist is walking down towards the hip; and three
     straps, with buckles in front, have abridged so much of the
     usurpation of the petticoat. One cannot see so many Ladies of
     high ton with the straps over the bosom, without thinking how
     much better they might have been employed over the
     shoulders."--(_Times, Aug. 27, 1796._)

       *       *       *       *       *

     "Before the waist is quite again in fashion, and while the thing
     exists (which will soon be incredible), we set down the
     measurement of a petticoat in the summer of 1796, which for a
     middling-sized woman is five foot and an inch."--(_Times, Nov. 4,
     1796._)

       *       *       *       *       *

     "It would not be easily believed by our Great Grandmothers, that
     their lovely daughters cannot make their appearance without a
     dozen combs in their heads, and as many false curls and cushions.
     The victory over black pins is complete."--(_Times, May 30,
     1797._)

       *       *       *       *       *

     "Horse Hair has risen near 50 per cent. since Wigs have become so
     much the rage."--(_Times, April 27, 1798._)

       *       *       *       *       *

     "The women at Paris are every day divesting themselves of some of
     the customary articles of dress, and the rage for _nudity_ is so
     great, that it is apprehended, even by the Parisian Journalists,
     they will shortly have the effrontery to present themselves to
     the public eye in a state of pure nature. One of them appeared a
     few days since in the Champs Elysées, in a simple robe of spotted
     black gauze, and shewed so much that little was left to guess.
     The spectators were struck with indignation at this flagrant
     violation of decorum, and she was compelled to make a shameful
     and precipitate retreat."--(_Times, June 18, 1798._)

       *       *       *       *       *

     "An Artist has advertised that he makes up worn out Umbrellas
     into fashionable Gypsey Bonnets. The transition is so easy, that
     he is scarce to be praised for the invention.

     "The _Gypsey Bonnet_ is commonly worn by the Lancashire
     Witches."--(_Times, July 7, 1798._)

       *       *       *       *       *

     "We are very happy to see the waists of our fair country women
     walking downwards by degrees towards the hip. But, as we are a
     little acquainted with the laws of increasing velocity in
     fashionable gravitation, we venture to express, thus early in
     their descent, a hope that they will _stop there_."--(_Times,
     April 15, 1799._)

       *       *       *       *       *

     "_Straw_ in the head-dress, according to the laws and immemorial
     customs of the stage, denotes the unsoundness of the brain it
     covers. Several of those useful and respectable young men, who
     make the campaign of Bond Street, have thought proper to invest
     their temples with the sacred symbols, and wear straw hats to
     give notice of their light-headedness."--(_Times, July 4, 1799._)

The Censor could also be severe on the harmless "Reticule."

     "In the present age of political innovation, it is curious to
     observe the great veneration for antiquity which prevails in all
     our dresses and fashions. Queen Elizabeth's ruffs decorate our
     blooming belles; and our beaux are puckered and stuffed on the
     shoulders _à la Richard the Third_. But what is still more
     remarkable, is the total abjuration of the female pocket. Those
     heavy appendages are no more worn at present than keys at the
     girdles. Every fashionable fair carries her purse in her workbag.
     Her money and her industry lie cheek by jowl: and her gambling
     gains lie snug by her housewife. Her handkerchiefs, her toothpick
     case, her watch, and her keys, if she has any, are the constant
     concomitants of her visits; and while no part of the symmetry of
     her shape is altered or concealed by the old-fashioned panniers,
     she has the pleasure of laying everything that belongs to her
     upon the table wherever she goes."--(_Times, Nov. 9, 1799._)

       *       *       *       *       *

     "A dashing Lady of Fashion, inconvenienced by the new custom of
     carrying a bag with her handkerchief, smelling-bottle, purse,
     &c., &c., went to a large party the other evening, attended by a
     Page, who was employed to present the articles as they might be
     wanted. The Page was well qualified to go through the fatigues of
     office, being well-made, active, and just one and twenty. Should
     the example be imitated, Pages will probably be more in request
     than waiting-women."--(_Times, Dec. 7, 1799._)

       *       *       *       *       *

     "If the present fashion of nudity continues its career, the
     Milliners must give way to the Carvers, and the most elegant
     _fig-leaves_ will be all the mode.

     "The fashion of _false bosoms_ has at least this utility, that it
     compels our fashionable fair to wear _something_."--(_Times,
     Dec. 11, 1799._)

With which most pungent criticism, we will take our leave of lady's
_dress_.




NAVY AND ARMY.


No history of England, that I know of, has ever given us so graphic a
description of the ways and means for procuring men for the Navy, as
the Newspapers of the time, and in this, as in many other things,
their help is invaluable.

When we find from what classes the Navy was recruited, we wonder at
what the men went through, without much murmuring; and, if their very
moderate, and just, demands, had been met in a conciliatory spirit, or
even, officially investigated, instead of being pooh-poohed, and
shelved--there would have been no mutiny at the Nore, nor elsewhere.

When afloat, sailors were kept in subjection, or as it was termed,
discipline, by brutality, foul language, and a plentiful application
of the lash, to be recouped by almost unlimited license, whilst on
shore, or, for the matter of that, when afloat, if at home in harbour.
When the _Royal George_ went down, there were 200 women on board, and
in Dibdin's song of "Wapping Old Stairs," the heroine plaintively
reminds her temporary lover thus--

  "When _I passed a whole fortnight between decks with you_,
  Did I e'er give a kiss, Tom, to one of the Crew?"

When the War with France broke out, it was hardly to be imagined that
Fishermen, and Merchant seamen, would volunteer to leave their quiet
occupation, to be bullied by petty, and other officers; to be triced
up, and lashed unmercifully, for even a venial fault; to be no better
paid, nor fed than they were already; and to have an extra chance of
death in a Naval engagement, even if the English were victorious, or
the certainty of semi-starvation in a French prison, if captured. So
the State, wanting food for slaughter, stretched out its strong hand,
and took it, by means of the pressgang. I shall have to recount a long
list of "severe," or "hot," presses--and, first of all, in order that
we may perfectly understand what a "press" was, and so thoroughly
identify ourselves with the position, let us see the very minute, and
vivid, description of _Smollett_, in "Roderick Random."

[Illustration: My Poll & my Partner Joe.--1796.]

"As I crossed Tower Wharf, a squat, tawny fellow, with a hanger by his
side, and a cudgel in his hand, came up to me calling, 'Yo ho!
brother, you must come along with me.' As I did not like his
appearance, instead of answering his salutation, I quickened my pace,
in hopes of ridding myself of his company; upon which, he whistled
aloud, and immediately another sailor appeared before me, who laid
hold of me by the collar, and began to drag me along. Not being of a
humour to relish such treatment, I disengaged myself of the assailant,
and, with one blow of my cudgel, laid him motionless on the ground;
and, perceiving myself surrounded in a trice, by ten or a dozen more,
exerted myself with such dexterity and success, that some of my
opponents were fain to attack me with drawn Cutlasses; and, after an
obstinate engagement, in which I received a large wound on my head,
and another on my left cheek, I was disarmed, taken prisoner, and
carried on board a pressing tender; where, after being pinioned like a
malefactor, I was thrust down into the hold, among a parcel of
miserable wretches, the sight of whom well nigh distracted me.

"As the commanding officer had not humanity enough to order my wounds
to be dressed, and I could not use my own hands, I desired one of my
fellow-captives who was unfettered, to take a handkerchief out of my
pocket, and tie it round my head, to stop the bleeding. He pulled out
my handkerchief ('tis true), but, instead of applying it to the use
for which I designed it, went to the grating of the hatchway, and,
with astonishing composure, sold it before my face to a bum boat
woman, then on board, for a quart of gin, with which he treated my
companions, regardless of my circumstances, and entreaties.

"I complained bitterly of this robbery, to the midshipman on deck,
telling him, at the same time, that, unless my wounds were dressed, I
should bleed to death. But compassion was a weakness of which no man
could justly accuse this person, who squirted a mouthful of dissolved
tobacco upon me through the gratings, told me 'I was a mutinous dog,
and that I might die, and be damned.' Finding there was no other
remedy, I appealed to patience, and laid up this usage in my memory,
to be recalled at a fitter season. In the meantime, loss of blood,
vexation, and want of food, contributed, with the noisome stench of
the place, to throw me into a swoon; out of which I was recovered by
the tar who stood centinel over us, who at the same time regaled me
with a draught of flip, and comforted me with the hopes of being put
on board the _Thunder_ next day, where I should be freed of my
handcuffs, and cured of my wounds by the doctor."

Now let us see how the press worked--

     "The Press in the River Thames, for the three last days, has been
     very severe. Five or six hundred seamen have been laid hold
     of."--(_Times, February 18th, 1793._)

       *       *       *       *       *

     "On Wednesday night the press was very hot on the river Thames;
     all the ships, both homeward, and outward, bound, were stripped
     of their hands; not excepting two outward bound East Indiamen,
     which were to have sailed yesterday."--(_Times, March 9, 1793._)

       *       *       *       *       *

     "The press has been so hot, for seamen, since the order of Friday
     last, that three Tenders, full of men, have been dispatched from
     the Tower to the 'Sandwich' guardship at the Nore."--(_Times,
     March 27, 1793._)

       *       *       *       *       *

     "A hot press has, for the last two nights, been carried on from
     London bridge to the Nore; protections are disregarded, and
     almost all the vessels in the River have been stripped of their
     hands."--(_Times, April 26, 1793._)

       *       *       *       *       *

     "The sailors are so scarce, that upwards of 60 sail of merchants
     ships, bound to the West Indies, and other places, are detained
     in the River, with their ladings on board; seven outward bound
     East Indiamen are likewise detained at Gravesend, for want of
     sailors to man them."--(_Times, Jan. 7, 1794._)

       *       *       *       *       *

     "The number of seamen to be voted for the service of the present
     year, including 12,000 marines, will be 85,000 men."--(_Times,
     Jan. 29, 1794._)

       *       *       *       *       *

     "There was a smart press on Monday, on the river, for seamen,
     and, in many of the avenues to the town, several hundreds were
     picked up, and put on board the receiving ship at the
     Tower."--(_Times, April 2, 1794._)

       *       *       *       *       *

                                            "Poole, Nov. 30.

     "This morning arrived in Steedland Bay, the 'Maria,' from
     Newfoundland, having some passengers on board, besides the crew;
     the officers of the impress service expecting to meet some
     resistance, had called for military assistance, and 20 soldiers,
     armed, went on board the tender, which went down the harbour, to
     meet the vessel; when coming alongside, and finding the people
     obstinate, orders were given to the soldiers to fire, which they
     did; the pilot (then at the helm), and two other men, were killed
     on the spot, and seven others dangerously wounded, one of whom is
     since dead. Lieutenants Phillips and Glover, with all who were on
     board the tender, are taken into custody, and the whole town is
     in the greatest commotion."--(_Times, Dec. 3, 1794._)

     "That part of Mr. Pitt's plan for manning the navy, which
     recommends to the Magistrates to take cognizance of all idle, and
     disorderly people, who have no visible means of livelihood, may,
     certainly, procure a great number of able bodied men who are
     lurking about the metropolis, if properly enforced. But
     experience teaches, that, unless the Magistrates see that their
     _Runners_ do justice to the public, this salutary measure may be
     in a great measure defeated, from the interest which the
     _Runners_ are known to have, in _nursing_ those vagabonds, which
     the law enacts should be laid hold of."--(_Times, Feb. 11,

     Newcastle, the result of which was, the choosing of a Committee,
     three of whom are to confer with Mr. Dundas--'to recommend the
     suspension of the impress, to send into actual service the gangs
     and crews of the tenders, (amounting, it is said, from seven to
     ten thousand,) to increase the wages of seamen in the navy, and
     to pay half of it, monthly, for the support of their

     in attempting to board a Liverpool trader, were resisted by the

The following instructive little story will shew how mutinies were
made:--

     "The mutiny which existed several days on board the 'Culloden' of
     74 guns, and which, it is said, originated in the wish of the
     crew to have the ship docked, previous to her sailing for the
     West Indies, was, on Wednesday, settled by an order from the
     Admiralty in the following manner:--'That several Captains were
     to go on board and inform the crew, unless they immediately
     returned to their duty, the "Royal George" of 110 guns, and
     "Queen," of 98 guns, would directly be laid alongside them.' They
     were allowed half an hour to consider the matter. The officers,
     and others, who chose to leave the ship, were at liberty so to
     do. The ship's company several times wanted to make terms, which
     could not possibly be complied with: in about twenty minutes they
     all agreed to return to their duty; 12 of the ringleaders were
     instantly seized, and put in irons, and will no doubt be tried by
     a Court Martial for the same. During the time the ship was in
     this mutinous state, the crew flogged several marines because
     they would not join them, and would have punished the whole, had
     they gone below."--(_Times, Dec. 13, 1794._)

       *       *       *       *       *

     "The cause of the mutiny, on board the 'Culloden,' was briefly
     this. In coming into Spithead, the 'Sampson,' and 'Culloden,'
     both run a-ground. The former was a good deal damaged: the latter
     lost only her rudder, which could easily be repaired at Spithead,
     but the 'Sampson' was obliged to be carried into dock. Some of
     the seamen of the 'Culloden,' in a mutinous manner, expressed
     their doubts of the safety of the ship: and, upon being
     remonstrated with, insisted upon going into harbour."--(_Times,
     Dec. 16, 1794._)

Which were right, the Sailors, or the Admiralty?

Here is a curious case, which shows the want of men to man the fleet,
and how unscrupulously even magistrates lent themselves against all
justice, and equity, in helping to kidnap men for the use of the Navy
Services:--

     "PUBLIC OFFICE, BOW STREET.--A master bricklayer, of the name of
     Whitehead, brought his apprentice before the sitting magistrate,
     on a charge of having stolen a scaffolding board, value under
     _ninepence_: he had his choice, either to enlist as a soldier, or
     to be sent on board the fleet: to both of which he objected. The
     Magistrate then ordered a letter to be written to the Regulating
     Captain, Tower Hill, to have him sent on board the
     Navy."--(_Times, Jan. 5, 1795._)

On this, one of the spectators addressed Mr. Bond, and told him he was
acting improperly.

     "Who are you?" says Mr. B----. "I am a Mr. Thompson, a Member of
     the House of Commons for Evesham: and I tell you that you act
     illegally." "Do you tell me, sitting here as a magistrate, that I
     act illegally?" "I do: for the boy has committed a crime, he is
     not to be punished by you, or any other justice: it is to the
     laws of the land, and to them alone, that he is amenable: and I
     say, that it is a violation of the liberty of the subject." Mr.
     Bond observed, that the King wanted men: and did not Mr. Thompson
     think that it was proper to procure those for him, who had
     forfeited their liberty? Mr. T. replied, that he knew that the
     King _did_ want men, but that that was a very improper mode of
     coming at them. Mr. Bond then observed, that probably Mr. T.
     might investigate it in the House of Commons: but whether he did
     or did not, he should act as he thought proper for that time. He
     then sent for Major Leeson, and had him enlisted. Mr. Thompson
     signified as much to him, as that it should be brought before the
     House."

(On Monday, 5th Jan., the matter was introduced in a speech of Mr.
Thompson's, on the Habeas Corpus Bill, but nothing was done.)

Jack did, occasionally, get some prize money, but nothing ever came up
to the "Hermione" in 1762, when each ordinary seaman had about £800
for his share; but when we look at the disparity between the Captain's
and Sailor's share, we can enter into the spirit of the Sailor's
prayer, before an engagement, that the shots might be apportioned,
like the prize money,--the greater part among the officers.

     "By the determination of the Lord Chancellor in favour of the
     captors of the _St. Jago_ Register ship, Admiral Gell will get,
     as his proportion, near £100,000 prize money. All the captains of
     his fleet will divide about £30,000, and so downwards in
     proportion. The precise value of the _St. Jago_, Spanish ship,
     retaken in April 1793, from the French, which the Lords of Appeal
     adjudged to the captors, on Thursday evening last, is
     £935,000."--(_Times, Feb. 4, 1795._)

       *       *       *       *       *

     "The first payment of the immense St. Jago prize is commenced,
     Captain Sir A. Douglas having received his share. The following
     is the declared proportion of the specie only: Each Captain's
     share, £13,920; Lieutenant's share, £910; Warrant officer's
     share, £612; Petty officer's share, £140; Foremast-man's share,
     £26. Besides two seventh's shares of the whole in reserve, till
     the question, whether the _Boyne_, and _Powerful_, have a right
     to share with the Squadron. The above statement is independent of
     the valuable cargo, and bullion, which are yet to be shared. The
     Admiral's shares are not yet declared."--(_Times, March 21,
     1795._)

     "Saturday, the 26th inst., the sailors on board the _Sea Horse_
     frigate, had 2800 dollars served out to them at Portsmouth, and
     leave of absence for 48 hours' recreation on shore. This ship
     shares the whole of the Spanish prizes taken by her, and carried
     into Portsmouth. Their cargoes consist principally of about
     300,000 dollars and gold doubloons, and about 120,000 raw hides,
     tallow," &c.--(_Times, Dec. 2, 1796._)

     "The Spanish prize, taken by the _Raven_ brig, one of Admiral
     Earl St. Vincent's squadron, which was sent home, now lies at
     Deptford, where she is strongly guarded, and no persons suffered
     to go on board, till she has gone through a complete search, as
     it is suspected some other valuables, besides the Platina, of
     which 4000 ounces have been taken out and sold, are hid. Platina
     is a metal of the colour of silver, and about one eighth heavier
     than gold. None has ever been seen in Europe, at least in any
     quantity, but in Spain where it is consigned to the Crown, from
     South America."--(_Times, Sept. 20, 1797._)

     "We stated several days since, that it had been determined by Mr.
     Pitt to alter, very materially, the Bill now before the House of
     Commons, for manning the navy. The principal alteration will be
     the taking off the burthen on ship-owners, of finding men before
     their ships can clear out; instead of which they are to advance a
     certain proportion of money, and Commissioners are to be
     stationed, at the out-ports, to find men out of this fund. The
     measure proposed is as follows,--that each Port shall, according
     to the number of seamen belonging to it, raise a certain number
     of men--that these men shall be fixed by Ballot--that those who
     have enrolled themselves to be balloted, shall receive a
     certificate of having done so, which shall secure them against
     pressing--that no man shall be permitted to serve on board a
     merchant ship, under a very heavy penalty, without such a
     certificate, that no ship shall be suffered to proceed from any
     Port, till the number of men required from the Port shall be
     raised; and that those who do not enrol themselves, shall be
     liable to be apprehended."--(_Times, Feb. 18, 1795._)

As we see by the following paragraphs, the parishes offered bounties
to fill up their quota of sailors:--

     "The Parish of St. James', Westminster, having, in a public
     manner, signified their wish, to raise _twenty-five men_,
     pursuant to the statute, to serve in His Majesty's Navy, had, by
     Wednesday last, completed that number: and the g-officer, in the
     course of the afternoon, examined them, and found them all
     extremely proper for His Majesty's service: and, on Thursday,
     they were examined and certified, by the Parochial Magistrates,
     when the men requesting to have £7, the third part of the
     bounty-money, advanced to buy slops, bedding, and for other
     purposes, it was immediately complied with."--(_Times, Apr. 7,

     "At a MEETING of the Vestries, Church-wardens, Overseers, and the
     principal inhabitants, of the Parishes of St. Margaret, and St.
     John the Evangelist, Westminster, in St. Margaret's Vestry Room,
     on Thursday, the 2nd day of April 1795, it was agreed to give a
     bounty of Twenty-five Guineas each to Twenty Men, to be raised
     for the Naval Service of His Majesty King George, in defence of
     Old England. All able-bodied men, willing to serve in His
     Majesty's Navy, are desired to apply, from the hours of nine in
     the morning till four in the afternoon, at the Vestry Room, in
     St. Margaret's Churchyard, Westminster, this, and the following
     days, Sundays excepted. To any man, who shall be approved by the
     Regulating Officer, part of the Bounty will be immediately paid,
     on his enrolment, either to himself or to his wife and family, or
     to any other person he may appoint to receive the same, and the
     remainder upon his being mustered on board of ship. He will have
     an opportunity of leaving a power for part of his wages and prize
     money, to be paid monthly for the support of his family, who will
     also be under the care, and protection of a kind and benevolent
     parish: and if his conduct is approved, he will have the
     preference, on his return, of any employment the Parish can give
     him. None need apply but able-bodied men. No volunteer, who shall
     enter as above, can be taken out of His Majesty's Service, but
     for a criminal matter. _N.B._ Persons enrolled, are not liable to
     serve more than three months after the War, if arrived in any

     the navy, are likely to be raised throughout the counties, and
     that the deficiency will be paid in money. The average price
     given in the Eastern Counties is £25 per man; so that the fine of

     assembled his men, and thus addressed them:--'You are a set of
     damned, blackguard, mutinous, rascals, and you know I think so of
     you all: we shall soon see whether you have any courage: I have
     only this to say to you, you see the Dutch ship that we shall
     soon be along-side: if you don't silence her in 40 minutes, I
     shall know what to think of you.--Now return to your quarters.'
     Turning to the Master, he said, 'Do you take care that these
     rascals, may not have to complain that they were not near
     enough.' In 20 minutes the Dutch ship struck her colours, and the
     'Powerful' bore away to assist the 'Venerable.' After the action,
     the Captains of the fore-castle came aft, and asked Capt. Drury
     if he still considered them a rascally set? 'No,' said Capt. D.,
     'your behaviour has perfectly satisfied me.' 'Will you then shake
     hands?' said the men, which he did most heartily, and assured
     them that he should never reproach them again for what had
     passed, and would, on his part, entirely forget that anything had
     ever happened. They then gave him three cheers, and, now, Capt.
     Drury is almost idolized by the crew."--(_Times, Nov. 16, 1797._)

     "Lord Camelford.

     "By the Leeward Island Mail, which arrived yesterday, we have
     received some very circumstantial advices of what passed in the
     West Indies, respecting Lord Camelford, who was tried by a Court
     Martial, on the 13th of January last, at Fort Royal Bay, for the
     murder of Lieut. Peterson, and acquitted.

                               "Antigua, _January 23, 1798_.

     "On the 13th inst. died, at English Harbour, Charles Peterson,
     Esq., first Lieutenant of H.M. ship _Perdrix_. This event was
     occasioned by a dispute between the deceased, and Lord Camelford,
     upon the right of commanding at English Harbour. Lord Camelford
     commanded H.M. sloop-of-war the _Favourite_, by virtue of an
     order, or warrant, from Admiral Harvey; and Mr. Peterson, though
     an older Lieutenant than Lord Camelford, had lately served on
     board that ship under his command, but, having been removed to
     the _Perdrix_, and Lord Camelford not having a commission as
     Master, and Commander, Mr. Peterson, being then at English
     Harbour, supposed himself to be the Commanding Officer, and,
     under that idea, issued some orders to Lord Camelford, which were
     answered by other orders from Lord C. to Mr. P. Upon Mr.
     Peterson's refusal to obey these orders, a Lieutenant with a
     party of Marines were sent to put him under arrest, and Mr. P.
     prepared for resistance, and ordered the crew of the _Perdrix_ to
     arm in his defence. But, before any conflict took place, Lord
     Camelford arrived, went up to Mr. P., demanded if he would obey
     his orders, or not, and, upon being answered in the negative, he
     immediately shot him dead upon the spot. An inquest was taken by
     the Coroner, the next day; but the Jury, not being willing to
     take upon themselves the determination of the question upon whom
     the command at English Harbour had devolved, found only that the
     deceased had been shot by Lord Camelford, in consequence of a
     mutiny."--(_Times, April 11, 1798._)

Extract of a letter from an Officer in H.M. ship _Vengeance_, dated
Antigua, February 9:--

     "Lord Camelford appears to me to be a new character in his
     _Class_. He is very severe in carrying on duty; seldom ties up a
     man but he gets six or seven dozen lashes, which is a more severe
     punishment in this country than what is produced by giving the
     same number in a northern climate.

     "Although his Lordship is a Master, and Commander, he makes use
     of no swabs (gold shoulder knots), but still appears in a
     Lieutenant's uniform. His dress is indeed extremely remarkable;
     _all the hair is shaved off his head_, on which he wears a
     monstrous large _Gold-laced cocked-hat_. He is dressed in a
     Lieutenant's plain coat, the buttons of which are as green with
     verdigrease, as the ship's bottom; and, with this, all the rest
     of his dress corresponds."

     _Extract of a private letter._

                                     "Cronstadt, _August 2_.

     "Our countrymen who have been employed at Revel, in conducting the
     embarkation of the Russian troops, have been honoured with great
     marks of attention from the Emperor, and his Family.

     "His Imperial Majesty requested the _Nile_ lugger, in which
     Captain Popham went to Petersburgh, to be brought up close to his
     palace at Peterhoff, where he went on board, accompanied by only
     one Nobleman. The lugger was immediately got under weigh, and,
     there being a fine breeze of wind, His Majesty was highly
     surprised, and gratified, at the swiftness of her sailings. After
     a two hour's cruise, he was landed again at the palace, when the
     lugger gave him a royal salute.

     "It appears the account he gave of the English vessel had greatly
     excited the curiosity of the rest of the Royal Family, as, next
     day, Captain Popham was honoured with the company of the Empress,
     the Emperor, Four Princesses, and Three Princes, with their
     retinue, when they were, of course, treated with a sail, at which
     they were highly delighted, and, with great condescension,
     partook of some ship beef, and biscuit. The Emperor was
     particularly attentive to everything on board the lugger,
     visiting every part of her, and, when the sailors were hoisting
     the sails, he insisted on helping for once, to set the sails of a
     vessel belonging to his gracious Ally, and actually hauled the
     rope with the men. The Empress begged that the crew would sing
     'God save the King,' which was instantly complied with, to Her
     Majesty's entire satisfaction.

     "Captain Popham was presented by the Emperor, with an elegant
     snuff-box set with diamonds, and with a valuable ring from Her
     Imperial Majesty. His Majesty has likewise knighted Captain
     Popham, conferring on him the Order of St. John of Jerusalem.
     Lieutenant Pratt, Captain Popham's Assistant in this business,
     has also been presented with a gold snuff-box, from the Emperor,
     and a handsome gold watch and chain, from the Empress."--(_Times,
     August 28, 1799._)

Was the under-mentioned lady the veritable heroine of the ballad of
"Billy Taylor?"

     "There is at present in the Middlesex Hospital, a young, and
     delicate female, who calls herself Miss T--lb--t, and who is said
     to be related to some families of distinction; her story is very
     singular:--At an early period of her life, having been deprived
     by the villany of a trustee, of a sum of money bequeathed her by
     a deceased relation of high rank, she followed the fortunes of a
     young Naval officer, to whom she was attached, and personated a
     common sailor before the mast, during a cruise in the North Seas.
     In consequence of a lover's quarrel, she quitted the ship and
     assumed for a time the military character: but her passion for
     the sea prevailing, she returned to her favourite element, did
     good service, and received a severe wound, on board Earl St.
     Vincent's ship, on the glorious 14th of February, and again bled
     in the cause of her country, in the engagement off Camperdown. On
     this last occasion her knee was shattered, and an amputation is
     likely to ensue. This spirited female, we understand, receives a
     pension of £20, from an illustrious Lady, which is about to be
     doubled." (_Times, Nov. 4, 1799._)

In 1793, the war with France, which was, on and off, to last so long,
was an accomplished fact--and one of the first notices thereof, at
least, pictorially, makes fun of the good intentions of the patriotic
ladies of England, towards the personal comforts of the army.

Men were most urgently wanted--but it had hardly come to the
following:--

     Government can give no countenance to his application." But it

     under sentence of transportation, have within the last few days,
     been permitted to enter into marching regiments. The crown
     debtors in the various prisons, have received similar
     offers."--(_Times, Oct. 9, 1795._)

     assembling at Jersey, have received orders to keep themselves
     ready, at a short notice, to repair to their destinations. About
     400, have enlisted in town, and between 500, and 600, at
     _Jersey_."--(_Times, Jan. 29, 1794._)

Here is a very early Notice of Volunteers:--

     "We are happy to hear that the Grand Juries of the different
     counties, intend to recommend the forming Volunteer Companies, to
     augment the _Militia_. The Grand Jury, at Reading, greatly
     approved this measure, and the sum of 14, or £1500, has already
     been subscribed, at that place, for carrying it into
     effect."--(_Times, March 8, 1794._)

     "The following are the terms for raising Independent Companies.
     For a Company, a Lieutenant on full pay is to raise fifty men,
     including three corporals, to be allowed five guineas levy money,
     and the pay of three serjeants, and two drummers, during the
     levy, and to receive £150 from the successor to his lieutenancy.
     A Lieutenant on half pay, to raise the like number, but to be
     allowed eight guineas levy-money. For a Lieutenancy, an Ensign on
     full pay is to raise twenty men, including a corporal, and to be
     allowed five guineas levy-money with the pay of a sergeant, and a
     drummer, during the levy. An Ensign on half-pay, to raise the
     like number, but to be allowed seven guineas
     levy-money."--(_Times, March 7, 1794._)

     "The following, we understand to be the heads of the plan to be
     proposed for the consideration of the Lords Lieutenants of the
     different counties, for the internal defence of the Kingdom.

     "1st. The Militia is to be augmented by Volunteer Companies, or
     by an additional number of privates to each company, in the
     option of His Majesty.

     "2ndly. Volunteer Companies are to be formed in particular towns:
     in those particularly situated on the sea coast, for purposes of
     local defence.

     "3rdly. A certain number of soldiers for each Regiment: to act as
     pioneers, as well as persons in different parishes, and
     districts, not attached immediately to the Militia, to act in the
     same capacity: and certain places to be appointed for their
     rendezvous, particularly upon the sea coast; but these to be
     ready to assist the regular forces upon every emergency.

     "4thly. Volunteer Troops of Fencible Cavalry are to be raised,
     consisting of from 50, to 80, men per troop, which are liable to
     serve only during the war, and within the Kingdom: the Officers
     are to have temporary rank only, and are not to be entitled to
     half pay: arms, clothing, and accoutrements, to be furnished by
     the Government, but the levy-money to be found by the persons
     raising such troops, or troops, as also the horses; for the
     horses, however, they are to be allowed the Government contract
     price. The person who, upon the above terms, raises two troops,
     is to have the temporary rank of Major; he who raises four, that
     of Lieutenant Colonel; and he who raises six, that of Colonel.

     "Fifthly, Bodies of Cavalry are, besides, to be raised within
     particular districts, or counties, to consist of the Gentlemen
     and Yeomanry, or such persons as they shall recommend, according
     to a plan to be approved of by the King, or by the Lords
     Lieutenant, under authority from His Majesty; the Officers are to
     receive Commissions from His Majesty, and the Muster Rolls are
     also to be approved of by His Majesty, or by the Lords
     Lieutenant, at particular periods to be hereafter fixed; no levy
     money is to be given, and the horses are to be provided by the
     Gentry or Yeomanry who compose the particular corps; the arms and
     accoutrements, are, however, to be supplied at the public
     expense. Such corps are to be exercised only at particular times,
     fixed by warrant from His Majesty, or by the approbation of the
     Lords Lieutenant. They are to be liable to be embodied, or called
     out of their respective counties, only by special direction from
     His Majesty, in case of actual appearance of invasion; and to be
     liable to be called upon by order from His Majesty, or by the
     Lords Lieutenant, or Sheriff of the county, to act within the
     county, or in the adjacent counties, for the suppression of riots
     and tumults. In either case, they are to receive pay as cavalry,
     and are to be liable to the provisions of the Mutiny
     Bill."--(_Times, Mar. 13, 1794._)

     _Qualifications._--"The officers of the London Militia, according
     to the Bill now in the House of Lords, are to be qualified
     according to the Act of the 26th George III. Cap. 107, Sec. 8.

                                 Real or Personal.

     seised of an estate, either in law, or equity, the claim or grant
     whereof was originally made for 20 years, of the same annual
     amount, to be a qualification."--(_Times, June 26, 1794._)

     "An extraordinary circumstance lately happened to a sheriff's
     officer, in the neighbourhood of Covent Garden. Hot with _juniper
     berry_, not the _Tuscan Grape_, he had an idea of beating the
     _Carmagnols_; and in consequence, going to a recruiting party in
     Bow Street, said he would _enlist_. The Captain of the party gave
     him a shilling, in the usual phrase of _His Majesty's name_:--he
     said he must have more:--a guinea was given him in His Majesty's
     name, to serve so and so; he took it, and departed. The matter
     thus rested for five or six days, when he came back to return the
     money, which he said he had taken _in a frolic_. The money was
     refused. He said he would be revenged, and, having a writ some
     days after, against one of the enlisted recruits, he went to the
     rendezvous house to execute it, where the Captain took him up as
     a _deserter_, and sent him to the _Savoy Prison_, from whence he
     has been released by a _Habeas Corpus_, contrary, as military men
     say, to the law by which the military are governed. This will
     occasion a most curious contest."--(_Times, June 30, 1794._)

     "Something like a _legal mutiny_ has, it seems, already arisen in
     the _long robed_ Corps of Volunteers. By a clause in their
     _engrossed agreement_, every Member neglecting to attend the
     regular _drill_, is _bound_ to pay a _fine of three shillings and
     four-pence_, towards purchasing _parchment_ to new head their
     drums. Against this _penalty_ being _levied_, some of the
     absentees have _demurred_, on the _plea_ that the _instrument_ is
     not _valid_ in _law_, from its not being _drawn_ on a _six
     shilling stamp_."--(_Times, July 17, 1794._)

     "A melancholy accident happened yesterday, about one o'clock, at
     the Recruiting Office, Angel Court, Charing Cross. A sergeant
     having kidnapped a man, for the better securing him, had
     confined him in a back-garret at the top of the house, after he
     had cut off his hair, to disfigure him, and, tying his hands
     behind him, and locking the door, left him by himself. By some
     means, the man got his hands loosened, and chose rather to risk
     his life by jumping from the window, than suffer himself to be
     any longer in their clutches; accordingly, he attempted to pitch
     upon a leaded roof, which was about half way to the bottom, but,
     unfortunately, jumping short, he fell back, and his head falling
     against the wall, his skull was fractured in such a shocking
     manner, that he died in about an hour afterwards. The populace
     were so much enraged at this shocking enormity, which we are
     sorry to believe is too often repeated, that they almost
     demolished the Recruiting Office. The mob had increased to so
     great a degree at ten o'clock last night, that it was found
     necessary to call out a party of the Horse Guards, for the
     protection of the neighbourhood."--(_Times, Aug. 16, 1794._)

[Illustration: Kidnapping, or a disgrace to Old England]

This was a serious riot. The mob at that time was peculiarly
excitable, and had a great deal more of its own way than it has now.
So a spark only was wanted to make a flame. This was found in a
rumoured case of kidnapping for the army; impressing for the navy
could be understood, because it had obtained from time immemorial,
that when the king wanted men to man his war vessels, he took seamen,
or fishermen, but this was something new, and must be put down,
otherwise no man was safe. The truth was not scrupulously adhered to,
and the print shops, ever eager to make money by pandering to the
passions of the hour, published exaggerated, and heartrending
pictures, of the way in which the army was recruited, and, altogether,
a very pretty riot was got up.

     "On Saturday morning, early, a mob again collected before Angel
     Court, Charing Cross, and attacked the house from whence the
     unfortunate young man had thrown himself into the street. The
     populace proceeded to gut the house, throwing the furniture out
     of the windows. The street was covered with feathers from the
     beds which were torn to pieces: they were proceeding to demolish
     an adjoining house, when the military were called in, and several
     officer's detachments, both of horse, and foot, again paraded the
     streets at Charing Cross. The mob having assembled again
     yesterday morning, and becoming very riotous, a troop of Horse
     Guards was very properly ordered out, and two or three of the
     principal rioters about the King's Arms Public House, taken into
     custody.

     "It is some satisfaction that we have heard the Coroner's report
     on the investigation of this unpleasant business. A most
     respectable jury sat five hours, on Saturday night, to consider
     of the verdict: and, after the most minute testimony of several
     witnesses, it was proved that the young man, whose name was
     _Howe_, and lived at Wandsworth, was a Lunatic, and had been
     several times confined by his friends. He had himself offered to
     enlist; no blame whatever attaches in this instance, to the
     people of the house. We trust that this impartial enquiry will
     satisfy the minds of every one, and that there will be no more
     mobs."--(_Times, Aug. 18, 1794._)

     "In consequence of a mob again assembling at Charing Cross,
     yesterday evening, the Horse Guards were again called out, and
     paraded the streets till midnight."--(_Times, Aug. 19, 1794._)

     "THE RIOTS IN LONDON.

     "We had flattered ourselves with the hope, that the very fair,
     and public, investigation which took place on the Coroner's
     Inquest, which sat on Saturday last on the body of the
     unfortunate man, Howe, who threw himself out of a window of a
     Recruiting House, would have satisfied every man's mind, that
     Howe was a Lunatic, and had been so for many years past: and that
     it was in a fit of Lunacy, that he destroyed himself. We hoped
     after this investigation, all kinds of mobs would have ceased.

     "We are sorry to observe, that the people are instigated to riot
     by the false representations daily made in those Jacobin prints,
     which are, at all times, so eager to announce, and magnify, every
     public misfortune. One of these yesterday asserted, 'that a poor
     woman with five children, and herself now pregnant, suspecting
     the crimps had decoyed her husband into a house in Whitcomb St.,
     watched it, and _by chance saw her husband chained to the
     floor_.' An evening paper of yesterday, observes 'that the
     guards, both horse and foot, were _as usual_, grossly insulting
     inoffensive passengers,' and it concludes with a piece of advice
     to these military gentlemen, 'that they are not always with
     musquets, and swords, in their hands, and that the people may be
     roused to resistance.' Now we know that no gentlemen could have
     observed greater caution than the military have done on this
     occasion: and the above remarks have no other object than to
     excite riot.

     "On Tuesday last, _John Kerr_ and _John Ruggle_, were committed
     to Newgate for stripping a man of his cloaths. Kerr is the man
     who keeps a house in Whitcomb Street, Charing Cross; which was
     assailed by a mob on Tuesday night, and very much damaged. It was
     owing to this riot, that the Horse Guards were again called out,
     and paraded the streets, through the night, as well as yesterday,
     to keep the peace.

     "Six of those who were found in Kerr's house throwing the
     furniture out of the windows, were taken into custody, and,
     yesterday morning, were all committed to Tothill-fields
     Bridewell.

     "A riot also was attempted to be raised at a recruiting-office in
     Tooley St., Southwark, on Tuesday night.

     "Yesterday, a mob assembled before a house of the same
     description, in Shoe Lane, at which several stones were thrown:
     and, at length, it became so serious, that the Lord Mayor was
     called upon to interpose his assistance, and attended, and, by
     the interference of a few constables, the mob dispersed, but, in
     the evening, the number of people continuing to increase, a party
     of guards were sent from the Tower, and the Lord Mayor, at eight
     o'clock, read the Riot Act. The mob, after being driven out of
     Shoe Lane by the soldiers, rushed suddenly to Bride Lane, where
     they broke open a house which had been employed as a
     recruiting-office, and proceeded to throw the beds, and some
     little furniture that remained in it, out of the windows; but,
     hearing of the approach of the military, they fled, saying they
     had plenty more business to do. It was reported, at the time this
     paper was going to press, that the Recruiting Offices on Mutton
     Hill, and Cow-Cross, near Clerkenwell Green, had likewise met a
     similar fate."--(_Times, Aug. 20, 1794._)

       *       *       *       *       *

     "On Wednesday, the examinations closed respecting _Mrs. Hanna_,
     who kept the recruiting office at Charing Cross, when she was
     acquitted, no evidence being adduced to criminate her. This
     acquittal has been the consequence of a very scrutinizing
     investigation.

     "The riots were not confined, on Wednesday night, to Fleet St.
     and the neighbourhood, but extended to the Raven, in Golden Lane,
     and the Sash, in Moorfields, and very much damaged the Rum
     Puncheon, in Old St., and a private house in Long Lane. They
     were all recruiting houses. A recruiting house, opposite Fetter
     Lane, in Holborn, was completely gutted.

     "Yesterday, bills were very properly stuck up in different parts
     of the town, to the following purport:--'You are earnestly
     requested to depart hence, and not by remaining, encourage others
     to stop, by which a crowd will be accumulated, and your personal
     liberty may be endangered.' Parents were likewise warned from
     suffering their children to appear abroad.

     "It is greatly to be apprehended that there exists a scheme to
     raise mobs, and disturb the peace of the metropolis. On Friday,
     and Saturday, during the riots at Charing Cross, great pains were
     taken to persuade the people, that there were subterraneous
     passages from the houses to the Thames, and that men were sent
     off in the night. On Monday, and Tuesday, hand-bills were
     distributed, telling the people that men, and children, were
     kidnapped, and sent off to Canada, and elsewhere. Nothing can be
     more notoriously false than such assertions."--(_Times, Aug. 22,
     1794._)

       *       *       *       *       *

     "On Thursday night there was an attempt made to raise a riot in
     St. George's Fields, at the Milk House, the corner of the London
     Road, the master of which is a temporary Serjeant to recruit for
     some of the volunteer corps; but by the spirited behaviour of the
     recruits, soldiers and light horse volunteers, in that quarter,
     the incendiaries did not proceed to acts of violence. It was
     evidently apparent that the mob was led on by persons above the
     common rank, whose sole aim is, if possible, under the idea of
     some pretended grievance, to raise a general riot in the
     metropolis. On Thursday, several persons were committed to the
     New Compter, by the Lord Mayor, for being concerned in the riot
     in Shoe Lane; and six men were committed to Newgate, from the
     Public Office, in Worship Street, for being concerned in the
     riots at the Sash, in Moorfields, and at the Black Raven, in
     Golden Lane.

     "In the course of the same day, several attempts of a similar
     nature were made in different quarters of the town, which were
     prevented, however, by the appearance of the regular military,
     and, in some places, by the City Horse Volunteers, who have been
     out on duty every day. The recruiting offices in Drury Lane, and
     at Shoreditch, were attempted to be demolished. As the
     continuance of these riotous proceedings is of the most
     dangerous nature, we trust that some more decisive steps will be
     taken, by Government, for their suppression."--(_Times, Aug. 23,
     1794._)

     "The activity of the Magistrates, and the arrival of the Oxford
     Blues, to assist the Civil Power, caused the mobs to be cautious
     of appearing on Saturday. They found that it was determined to
     fire upon them if they did not desist; and, therefore, they
     thought personal safety the best policy. A very rigid, and
     severe, investigation will, no doubt, be made into the practice
     of _crimping_, and a stop put to the disgraceful manner of
     _recruiting_."--(_Times, Aug. 26, 1794._)

     RIOT IN ST. GEORGE'S FIELDS.

     "However expedient it is to recruit our Land Forces, and strongly
     as it is requisite to make our Navy respectable, and superior to
     the enemy, yet, in attaining these essential points, the
     constitutional liberty of the subject should be preserved. It is,
     therefore, with a degree of regret, we mention that the power of
     enlisting men for the Land Service, in particular, has been
     entrusted to persons who have abused the confidence reposed in
     them, and who have used the most unjustifiable means to
     accomplish their purposes. As an instance, among others that have
     previously been brought before the public, we are authorised,
     from the circumstances of the case, to state, that on Friday
     last, a very great mob assembled in _London Road_, leading from
     the Obelisk, in St. George's Fields, to the Elephant and Castle,
     at Newington Butts, and, having intimation that a number of men
     were there imprisoned by a certain description of _Crimps_, they
     attacked the house where these persons were confined, demolished
     the windows, and released eighteen men, who were chained together
     by hand-cuffs, and other iron ligaments.

     "The Borough Magistrates, on hearing of this outrage, immediately
     sent down their officers: and the _Acting Recruiting Serjeant_
     being taken into custody, he was, after a short examination,
     committed to the New Gaol. The circumstances which led to the
     discovery of this imprisonment, was, that of kidnapping a
     pot-boy, who, before he was chained down, contrived to break a
     pane of glass in the drawing-room window (for the house was a
     private one, and elegantly furnished), from whence he cried out
     'Murder!' This alarmed the neighbourhood, and, as it had been
     suspected by them, that persons were illegally confined there,
     the doors, and windows, were soon demolished, and the prisoners
     liberated. The Serjeant, and his crew, had two women of the town
     genteelly dressed up for the purpose of inveigling young men into
     the house, which they styled their lodgings, where the deluded
     were instantly hand-cuffed, and, about three or four o'clock, in
     the morning, sent off in coaches, hired for the purpose, to the
     country. On Saturday, several more youths, who were confined in
     other parts of the Fields, were released by the Magistrates,
     amidst the plaudits of a numerous multitude of
     spectators."--(_Times, Jan. 12, 1795._)

     from his parents, and lodged him in a house there. The mob broke
     the windows of it, and the boy was rescued. We have every reason
     to hope that the most severe punishment will be inflicted on the
     crimps, Government having taken every possible pains to prevent
     such abuses."--(_Times, April 16, 1795._)

     assembled about Charing Cross, and, under the pretence of
     delivering a man from the Crimping House, they attacked the
     house, which is up a little court near Northumberland House, and
     threw all the furniture out of the windows. Charing Cross was
     covered with feathers. The mob became so numerous, and
     disorderly, that it was found necessary to call in the assistance
     of the Horse Guards: and the Riot Act was twice read by a
     Magistrate. The street was much thronged, and the tumult
     continued, when this Paper went to press: although there had been
     no other act of serious mischief. No one can detest the business
     of Crimping more than we do: but we have strong reasons to

     when, after making every one pull off their hats, as they passed,
     they proceeded to Mr. Pitt's, in Downing St., and broke several
     windows in his house; but, the Guards being immediately called
     out, and appearing in sight, very soon dispersed them.

     "The Mob, afterwards, went over Westminster Bridge, and paraded
     to St. George's-fields, where they attacked the _Royal George_
     Public-house, near the Obelisk, and threw all the furniture of it
     into the road, and there burnt it. They gutted another
     Recruiting house, in Lambeth-Road, and, afterwards, made a
     bonfire of the furniture. This was mistaken by many, to be houses
     on fire. There were some of the Mob who kept watch on the outside
     of the houses, to give notice of the arrival of the military, who
     did not come till after the furniture of these two houses were
     consumed. The Mob compelled the inhabitants of the houses in the
     neighbourhood, to put up lights.

     "The Riot at Charing Cross, on Sunday night, was begun by a very
     few persons who wished for mischief, and called out the words,
     Crimps, and Kidnappers! The damage was done almost
     instantaneously, and the villains escaped, leaving a numerous
     assembly of people, who were only drawn together by an idle
     curiosity, on the Surrey-road, near the Circus. Yesterday
     morning, however, about seven o'clock, it was assailed by a mob,
     and, notwithstanding it was well defended, and that the door was
     plated with iron, it was forced, and the prisoners rescued. Last
     night the mob again assembled about half past eight o'clock, near
     the Obelisk, in St. George's fields, where they gutted another
     Recruiting Office, and threw the furniture into the road, of
     which they made a bonfire. At first, the mob consisted only of
     about one hundred men, but the flames soon attracted great
     numbers. About nine, the Horse Guards arrived, and soon dispersed
     the crowd. We wish they had come sooner, as it is extremely
     injudicious to the public interest, that such indecent sights
     should be repeated. It was very well known that a Mob meant to
     assemble, and, of course, the Military should have been at hand,
     to meet it. Several persons were much hurt, in not being able to
     disperse soon enough, which ought to be a warning not to mingle
     in such a crowd. The Duchess of Gloucester, who was at the
     Circus, with her daughter, was escorted home by a party of
     horse."--(_Times, July 14, 1795._)

     "The Riots continued on Monday evening in St. George's Fields,
     until the Military arrived to disperse the mob. Several persons
     were taken into custody, and lodged in the
     watch-house."--(_Times, July 15, 1795._)

[Illustration: Modern Mode of Beating up for Volunteers.]

The way in which the patronage in the Army was managed, was a crying
shame--children in their cradles had Cornetcies presented to them, and
their promotion went on several steps before they left school. We hear
of the natural consequence, in the following extract from the _Times,
4th Jan. 1794_:--

     "We are extremely sorry that our public duty should call upon us
     to make any unpleasant remarks on the officers of our Army
     abroad, but repeated letters from the Continent, received by all
     descriptions of persons, agree in saying that there is a great
     want of Subordination among our troops. We shall not enter into
     particulars on this subject, as our only object is, that this
     observation should meet the eye of the Commander-in-Chief, and
     other General Officers, and that they should take the matter into
     their serious consideration. The evil is certainly increased by
     having so many young men introduced into the Army, and placing
     them over the heads of veteran Soldiers."

       *       *       *       *       *

     "The scandalous abuses which have been so often, and so justly,
     complained of, as detrimental to the public service, of children
     being taken from school, and appointed Officers, cannot be too
     soon remedied, though it will be a Herculean task to cleanse the
     Augean stable. In mentioning the following circumstance, we have
     certainly no kind of ill-will towards the party concerned; but it
     is a fact, that a child, _not fourteen years of age_, is now
     under orders for embarkation at Plymouth, who has been taken from
     school, to join his regiment at _St. Domingo_, as Captain!!! It
     is impossible for any man, who has the interest of his country at
     heart, to hear of such abuses without commenting on them with the
     utmost severity. The fault is not with Government, but is
     attached to the custom which prevails in officering the army; a
     custom which cannot be too soon corrected."--(_Times, Feb. 10,
     1795._)

       *       *       *       *       *

     "The Duke of York has ordered circular letters to be sent round
     to the Colonels of Regiments, desiring a return to be immediately
     made to his Office, of the number of Captains in each Regiment,
     under TWELVE years of age; and of Lieutenant Colonels under the
     age of EIGHTEEN!!! The very scandalous abuses that have, of late,
     crept into the mode of officering the army, are such, as to have
     demanded a very serious enquiry: for numberless are the evils
     that have resulted from it, besides that it has given so much
     disgust to veteran Officers, whose fortunes were not adequate to
     the purchase of rank. Various are the instances of boys having
     been taken from school, to take the command of Companies of
     Regiments."--(_Times, March 20, 1795._)

     "Over a Warehouse for fashionable dresses, in Fleet St., is
     written up 'Speculum modorum,' or, the mirror of the fashions;

     Latin, in order to understand them. Others have sent for the
     Alphabet, in gingerbread, as preliminary education."--(_Times,

     "An alteration, we understand, is shortly to take place in the
     uniform of the officers of all the regiments of the line. The
     present full dress coat is to be abandoned in favour of a very
     short one, without any lace, or lappels, which the officers are
     always to wear when on duty, but discretionally at other
     times."--(_Times, Nov. 16, 1797._)

     regimentals, and the new uniform they say is so ugly."--(_Times,

     "Some of the sucking Colonels of the Guards have expressed their
     dislike of the short skirts. They say they feel as if they were
     going to be flogged."--(_Times, Nov. 21, 1797._)

Kelsey's was a famous fruiterer's, &c., in St. James's Street, and we
are here presented with one of the boy officers, whose legs cannot
reach the ground, and who has not yet lost his childish predilection
for "Sugar Plums." As a foil to him is given Colonel Burch, of the
Royal Household Troops--who is actively engaged in demolishing Ice
Creams.

[Illustration: Heroes Recruiting at Kelsey's 1797.]

The following paragraph tells a sad tale:--

     "The late order of the Cabinet for furnishing all His Majesty's
     troops with bread, in the same manner as if in camp, namely, a
     loaf of six pounds weight for five-pence, will, we doubt not,
     have the desired effect in preventing a continuance of those
     outrages, to which the military, in many parts of the kingdom,
     have been compelled, by absolute want."--(_Times, April 27,
     1795._)

But this order was modified, as we see.

     "A new regulation has been made throughout the whole Army, that
     instead of the additional allowance of Bread-Money, each Soldier
     is to receive 8d. per day clear."--(_Times, Oct. 2, 1795._)

The fate of a prisoner of War is always hard, and, as a rule, they are
not too luxuriously treated. When first we had large quantities of
French prisoners over here, they were nearly starved, but, afterwards,
their lot was much ameliorated. Probably they were better treated than
our people who were imprisoned in France, for, if the following letter
can be believed, they certainly were neither luxuriously housed, nor
fed.

     "The following is an Extract of a letter from an Officer of the
     'Castor' Frigate, captured some time since, by the French, dated
     _Quimper_ near Brest, Feb. 27, 1795:--

     'I wrote by Lady Ann Fitzroy, which I hope you have received; we
     were in a very bad state at that time: but since she has been
     gone, we have been a great deal worse. They now serve out nothing
     but bread, and horse-beans, for three weeks, or a month,
     together: and, when they do give meat, it is but six ounces of
     salt pork per man. It would make your heart ache, to see our poor
     sailors, without money, without cloaths, worn down by sickness,
     and emaciated to the last degree, fighting over the body of a
     dead dog, which they sometimes pick up, and devour with the most
     voracious appetites: and it is a fact, that the head, and pluck,
     of a dog, sold for 30 sous, the other day. Such scenes as this,
     was I obliged to undergo: but I am now in a house allotted for
     the officers, and am rendered very comfortable by the friendship
     of our second lieutenant, Mr. Hadaway. I am the only surviving
     midshipman of four, who came here, belonging to our ship. I have
     lost all my hair by sickness: but I live in hopes of seeing Old
     England, and my friends again.'--(_Times, April 16, 1775._)

       *       *       *       *       *

     "Several persons escaped from prison, bear the strongest
     testimony of praise towards Lady Ann Fitzroy, late a prisoner of
     war at _Quimper_, in France, who perhaps, suffered more insults,
     and bad usage, from her jailors, than any of her rank ever
     suffered before: but, regardless of her own distresses, she made
     it her sole business to alleviate those of her fellow-prisoners:
     made shirts, and caps, for all those in need, besides purchasing
     some hundreds of jackets, and trowsers, which she distributed
     amongst her unfortunate countrymen, in want of cloathing. Her
     Ladyship, also, every day, had a great quantity of veal, and
     soup, dressed, to distribute amongst the sick. Her unparalleled
     benevolence saved the lives of hundreds."--(_Times, June 12,

     2nd Battalion of the Breadalbane Fencibles, now in the Castle of
     Edinburgh. He received 1000 lashes, and was drummed out of the
     Battalion, for having, while on sentry at Leith, on the night of

     into the house of an inhabitant, the Civil Magistrates having
     delivered him over to the Military Law."--(_Times, Oct. 7,

The sale of Commissions is here openly acknowledged, although it was
not allowed, _vide_ the two following advertisements in the same paper
(1798, Jan. 15):--

     "Militia.--Any young Gentleman wishing for an Ensignsy in a
     highly respectable Regiment of Militia, where he will have the
     opportunity of forming the very first connections, may, on
     certain conditions of honour, solely between the parties, be so
     respectably introduced. The Advertiser, who is of the Church, and
     of undoubted character, as will be known, means to apply this
     only to a young person of some income of his own; or whose
     friends would add an allowance to his pay, so as to place him
     upon a more equal footing with his brother Officers, and superior
     rank. On a proper behaviour, there is no doubt but that he would
     soon have a Lieutenant's Commission, and it is to be considered
     that at the end of the War, he will be entitled to half pay, the
     same as the line. It is apprehended, too, that it might still
     more peculiarly suit one who may mean to ultimately go into the
     regulars, and would prefer having his first steps in the Militia.
     The Advertiser, not residing in London, a letter at Messrs.
     Wilson and Wright's, Walker's Court, Soho, for A. P., will be
     duly honoured in the course of 2 or 3 days, provided it is signed
     with real name, and address, without which it cannot be noticed.

     "Marines.--A young man of respectable connections, and of the
     best morals, is very anxious to be in the service of his King,
     and Country, in these momentous times, and therefore ardently
     intreats the patronage of any Lady or Gentleman, who has the
     interest to procure him, or the power to bestow upon him, a
     Lieutenancy of Marines. He does not mean to offer the insult of
     any pecuniary recompence; but he will assure a greatly more
     pleasing return to a benevolent mind, that of everlasting
     gratitude, and the most unimpeachable conduct. The honor of a
     line to F. G.," &c.

     sum of 8000 guineas."--(_Times, April 26th, 1796._)

that a line would be drawn at Chaplains.

     Derby, Westminster, North Gloucester, and Surrey regiments of
     Militia, marched into this town, from their respective stations,
     on their routes to the grand depot, at Horsham. The large
     bounties which these men have received, enable them to keep up a
     scene of drunkenness, and insubordination, which it is very
     difficult to restrain. After parade here, on Saturday evening,
     Sir Joseph Mawbey, and other Officers, commanding the Surrey
     Volunteers, were compelled to have recourse to their drawn
     swords, to enforce order, and maintain their command, which was
     for some time powerfully resisted, on their ordering a man to the
     guard-house. And, on dismissing the parade, yesterday evening, a
     similar disturbance took place. No swords were then drawn, but
     the clamour demanded the interference of General Hulse, who, in
     consequence, ordered out a piquet guard of infantry, and a
     patrole of horse, by which tranquillity was restored, and
     preserved. Others who have passed through this town, in their
     drunken frolics, distinguished themselves by swallowing
     Bank-notes between slices of bread and butter, and lighting their
     pipes with them, to the no small advantage of the
     Bankers."--(_Times, July 31, 1799._)




SOCIAL ECONOMY.


Under this head are placed many matters which could scarcely be
classified.

Take, for instance, the series of groups copied from a long picture of
the "Installation Supper, as given at the Pantheon, by the Knights of
the Bath, on the 26th of May 1788."

In looking at this series, we must never lose sight of the fact, that,
here, we are getting a peep at _haut ton_--none of your common
folk--and, if the picture be a true one, they must have been contented
with the roughest accommodation. Hard seats, plain tables, with no
Plate, nor floral decorations, no napkins; Knives and forks brandished
in a most reckless, and uncouth manner; an utter disregard for the
proprieties of the table, even to drinking the gravy out of a plate;
and intoxication, in its various phases, passing, seemingly,
unchallenged. A tankard of beer admitted to such a banquet, and two
people sharing the same "dish of tea," are all, to us, astounding
revelations of the social manners of our grandfathers.

[Illustration: Installation Supper.]

[Illustration:

  Sir F Johnston & Lady.
  Lord Bathurst.
  Major Topham.]

From the following we get a curious glimpse of the Social economy, of
the times--a phase of thinking which would scarcely do nowadays:--

     "In a complicated machine, any of the inferior parts getting out
     of order, will soon obstruct the whole: and, conceiving such may
     be the case with public society, we are led to make a few
     observations on some improprieties which occur in the present
     day.

     "The wages given to servants have increased during the last 10
     years, more than for 30, or perhaps 40, years before: and the
     misfortune is, that dissipation, and want of morals, have also
     much increased, particularly among manufacturing labourers, who
     now have got, in many places, only to work three, or four, days
     in the week, and to be drunk the remaining time, leaving their
     wives, and children, neglected, and in rags.

     "As to household servants, the accommodation offices for hiring
     of them, have had the worst effect. They make them indifferent
     about keeping their places; lure them on with false hopes, and
     often before a servant gets fixed, they, and the pawnbroker, put
     them under difficulties.

     "Travelling expences, by the profusion in the perquisites given
     to waiters, post boys, &c., have become enormous, and their
     attention is less; but, if those who give in that way, were to
     consider the injury they do the public, and of how little use it
     is to those who receive it, they would certainly think such money
     so squandered away, would have been better bestowed, if applied
     to some public charity, or left for the poor of the parish.

     "Increase of trade, and wealth, having produced an increase of
     luxury, and made the necessaries of life more expensive, it is
     proper that wages should be increased: but yet not beyond the
     bounds of proportion; for it will be found in those manufacturing
     occupations, in which labourers get the most money, they are the
     most disorderly, continually combining together to leave their
     work, unless their masters consent to increase their wages, and
     which only proves a temporary compromise, till they have an
     opportunity of making a further demand. On the contrary, where
     less wages are given, we shall find the people more happy, and
     contented, their wives more attended to, and their children
     brought up with more religion, and better morals."--(_Times,
     Sept. 5, 1794._)

       *       *       *       *       *

     "To the CONDUCTOR of the TIMES.

     "Sir,--Various are the receipts for cheap puddings, and many
     long, and useful, letters have appeared in your very excellent
     paper, towards alleviating (as much as is in the power of every
     Housekeeper) the scarcity, and dearness, of bread: by
     substituting rice, and potatoes, in the room of pies, or flour
     puddings: but there still exists an evil which I have not seen
     spoken against, and which certainly occasions a very great
     consumption of starch: I mean the general fashion which has
     prevailed for some years, and does still, from the highest, to
     the lowest, of wearing white dresses, which, upon a moderate
     computation, for every individual, must consume at least double
     the soap, and starch, than when coloured callicoes, silks, and
     stuffs, were in fashion: Added to this, that every maid servant
     (who, though she is perhaps not worth a second pair of shoes)
     will wear her muslin handkerchiefs. I think it is the duty of
     every good master, and mistress, to stop, as much as possible,
     the present ridiculous, and extravagant, mode of dress in their
     domestics. View, on a Sunday, a tradesman's family coming from
     church, and you would be puzzled to distinguish the porter from
     his master, or the maid from her mistress. Formerly a plaited
     cap, and a white handkerchief, served a young woman three, or
     four, Sundays. Now a mistress is required to give up, by
     agreement, the latter end of the week for her maids to prepare
     their caps, tuckers, gowns, &c., for Sunday, and, I am told,
     there are houses open on purpose, where those servants who do not
     choose their mistresses shall see them, carry their dresses in a
     bundle, and put them on, meet again in the evening, for the
     purpose of disrobing: and where, I doubt, many a poor, deluded,
     creature, has been disrobed of her virtue. They certainly call
     aloud for some restraint, both as to their dress, as well as
     insolent manner. Tell a servant, now, in the mildest manner, they
     have not done their work to please you, you are told to provide
     for yourself, and, should you offer to speak again, they are
     gone. Surely no set of people are more capable of rendering our
     families comfortable, or the reverse, than domestic servants, nor
     any set of people who feel the present dearness of provisions so
     little. I look upon their exorbitant increase of wages, as
     chiefly conducive to their impertinence: for, when they had five,
     or six, pounds a year, a month being out of place, was severely
     felt; but now their wages are doubled, they have, in a great
     measure, lost their dependence: And what is this increase of
     wages for? not in order to lay by a little, in case of sickness,
     but to squander in dress. No young woman, now, can bear a strong
     pair of leather shoes, but they must wear Spanish leather, and so
     on in every article of dress. No wonder, then, that there should
     be so many prostitutes, and so few good wives.

     "By inserting these hints, as soon as you conveniently can, you
     will much oblige,

                                       _A Constant Reader_."

     "We trust that the measure, which was, last year, so laudably
     attempted by the Brewers, Bakers, and Publicans, for the

     Customers, and the Public, that, on account of the excessive high
     price of Provisions, they find it impossible to continue the
     practice of giving CHRISTMAS BOXES to the servants of their
     customers, without sustaining, on the one hand, a deduction from
     their profits, which the trade will not allow, or, on the other
     hand, increasing their charges: they have, therefore, unanimously

     that their conduct, on this occasion, will not be deemed
     improper, or disrespectful."--(_Times, Dec. 9, 1795._)

The _Penny Post_ was an institution of those days, although its action
was limited as to distance. The following excerpts will enable us to
notice its different phases, during the years treated of:--

     "The Postmaster General has lately established a Penny Post at
     Manchester, which promises great convenience to the inhabitants
     of that place, and its vicinity."--(_Times, April 17, 1793._)

       *       *       *       *       *

     "The new Penny Post Office is likely to prove such a very great
     accommodation to the public, that the only wonder is--it has been
     so long neglected. Instead of the number of deliveries, and the
     hours of despatch, varying in different parts of the town, as at
     present, there will be six deliveries, each day, in all parts of
     the town: by which means, a person living at Mary-le-bonne, may
     send letters to, or receive letters from, Limehouse, a distance
     of seven miles, five times a day. Persons putting in letters by
     nine in the morning at the distance of ten miles from the chief
     Penny Post Office, and later, at less distant parts, may receive
     answers from London the same afternoon. There will be three
     deliveries of letters, in most parts of the country, within the
     limits of the Penny Post; and there will be two posts, daily,
     from all parts within the distance of ten miles from Lombard
     St."--(_Times, Feb. 28, 1794._)

       *       *       *       *       *

     "The proposed plan of a new Penny Post is no longer talked
     of:--It is every day more, and more, wanted, as the present mode
     is extremely irregular, and insufficient. According to the new
     plan, the Penny Post was to have gone out seven times a
     day."--(_Times, May 4, 1794._)

       *       *       *       *       *

     "The PENNY POST.

     "The late regulations in the Penny Post Office are certainly of
     the most essential service to the public: but the conduct of the
     Letter Carriers requires the most minute attention. They wall
     defraud where they think they can do it with impunity; and as an
     instance of this, we give the following fact. From any part of
     the Metropolis, to the Borough of Southwark, and its adjacent
     parts, is stated to be but _One penny_ per Letter. The Carriers,
     however, uniformly charged 2d. per Letter. A Complaint of this
     imposition was made to the Comptroller, by a Gentleman, whose
     house is in the Blackfriars Road, and an immediate answer was
     given 'that the Carrier had been severely reprimanded,' and the
     surcharge had been returned. His removal from that walk, gave his
     successor, who, perhaps, did not hear of this reprimand, an
     opportunity to continue the same imposition, and the letters to
     Blackfriars Road, and in other parts of St. George's Fields, were
     again charged 2d. The Comptroller was again applied to, and on
     the next evening, he wrote a letter to the person who sends this
     for publication, 'that the Carrier was ordered to return the
     surcharge.' The publication of this circumstance is requisite, as
     no doubt, similar extortions are practised in other parts of the
     suburbs. This is a matter that ought to be universally made
     known, as cent. per cent., even on a _penny_, is rather too much
     for a man, illegally, to pay."--(_Times, Oct. 27, 1794._)

"Franking," as the privilege of free postage was called, had already
assumed dimensions, so as to have become a scandal, which is well
exposed in the following notices:--

     "Motion respecting Clerks in Office.

     "Mr. _Dent_ said ... Public notoriety went to accuse the offices
     of great abuse of the privilege of franking ... that such abuses
     did exist, and to give the proofs of them was the object which he
     proposed to gain by his present motion. He would state to the
     House some of the abuses. Certain bags came to the Post Office,
     marked Ordnance, Navy, Treasury Bags, &c., and the letters
     contained in these bags were furthered without more enquiry.
     These bags, perhaps, contained a great quantity of letters from
     the various Clerks: he could produce an instance of a very
     inferior Clerk, who had franked to a great amount, by placing his
     initials on the superscription. He had looked attentively over
     the list of those who had the privilege, and he did not find his
     name among them.... Among other instances, he would mention a Mr.
     Lackington, a celebrated bookseller; he had friends in some one
     of the Offices, and the whole of his Catalogues were franked to
     different parts of the country. It was also notorious, that some
     persons had written to their country correspondents, that if they
     would deal with them, the whole mass of pamphlets published in
     London should be sent them free of postage: this was done by
     means of the Clerks in office. In short, there were persons whose
     salaries amounted to only £300, or £400 per annum, who from their
     situation, made £1000 or £1200. It surely could not be the
     intention of the House to permit such malversation, and,
     therefore, he should move for a Committee to enquire into these
     facts. Before the late regulation, venison has passed as nimbly,
     by the post, as it run when alive in its native park. After
     further conversation, the House divided.--For the Question, 53;
     Against it, 41.--Majority, 12."

     "It would have been extraordinary indeed, if Sir Benjamin Hammett
     had not opposed the Franking Bill: for we are informed from very
     good authority, that Letters franked by, and addressed to, him
     only, are to the amount of £2400 sterling _per annum_."--(_Times,
     March 11, 1795._)

       *       *       *       *       *

     "Debate on Franking.

     "Mr. _Hobart_ brought up the Report of the Committee upon the
     Bill to restrain the abuse of Franking.

     "Mr. _Dent_ said, he was sorry to add, that this privilege had
     been notoriously abused, and was so publicly known, that
     paragraphs had appeared in a newspaper, of a Member having
     received £300 annually, from a mercantile house, to give them the
     advantage of this privilege. He hoped this fact was false, but he
     feared, however, it would be found too well warranted. By this
     Bill, Members were to receive only fifteen letters, and send ten,
     therefore the abuse, to this extent, could not be continued. At
     the same time, he thought, and should, bye-and-bye, more
     particularly state, in the motion he should submit to the House,
     that, when they were curtailing their own privileges, the Clerks
     in office should not be permitted to continue their abuses.

     "Mr. _Courtenay_ said, by the official returns it appeared that
     £30,000 was franked by the various offices, which amounted to one
     third of the whole of what was franked by Members of Parliament.
     Now the privilege was restrained in Members of Parliament, it
     would become more valuable to the Clerks in Office, and he should
     not wonder, if some of them should become not sleeping, but
     _writing_, partners in mercantile houses....

     "Mr. _Dent_ observed, abuses in the offices did exist to a very
     great degree. The Commissioners of the Customs received large
     Packets which contained letters to all their acquaintances in
     Town: the abuse did not end here: 20 Custom-House Porters were
     immediately dispatched to 20 different parts of the town.

     "Mr. _W. Smith_ said, ... Public notoriety was sufficient grounds
     to proceed against the Offices. Though all those letters were
     superscribed for His Majesty's service, yet they went upon many
     other purposes. A friend of his had informed him of some Vine
     cuttings, which had been sent to Ireland, franked: he also knew
     of a silk gown franked into the country: this was hardly for His
     Majesty's service.

     "Mr. _Rose_ said, if those abuses, mentioned by the Hon.
     Gentleman, had been privately intimated, they would have had
     immediate attention and some remedy applied. The laws to prevent
     the abuse of franking had been transmitted to the several
     Offices, and by them the first offence was a penalty, and the
     second, a dismissal from Office.

     "The Bill was ordered to be read a third time on
     Friday."--(_Times, April 14, 1795._)

The following are to be the new rates of Postage in this country:--

     "For every single Letter by post, for any distance not exceeding
     15 miles, be charged 3d. Double letters 6d. Triple 9d. Those of 1
     ounce weight, 1s., and so, in proportion.

     "Above 15 miles, and not exceeding 30, for single Letters 4d.,
     and so, in the same proportion.

     "Above 30 miles, and not exceeding 60, 5d., and so, in
     proportion.

     "Above 60 miles and not exceeding 100, 6d., and so, in
     proportion.

     "Above 100 miles, and not exceeding 150, 7d., and so, in
     proportion.

     "All above 150 miles, 8d., &c.

     "Upon every single Letter to Scotland, 1d., the rates of Postage
     remaining the same, on double letters, 2d., &c.

     "That the present rates of Postage between London, and Portugal,
     and between London, and British America, do cease.

     "From any part of Great Britain, to Portugal, exclusive of Inland
     Postage, every single letter, 1s., &c.

     "The same from any part of Great Britain, to British America.

     "The Inland Postage upon said Letters according to
     distance."--(_Times, Dec. 12, 1796._)

The following paragraph is interesting, as it fixes the date of the
Postal Uniforms--the colours of which are still adhered to by the
Postal authorities, in clothing the Mail drivers:--

     "The Post Office Letter Carriers in London are to be provided
     with an uniform of red coats, faced with blue, and to wear
     numbers."--(_Times, Feb. 10, 1793._)

       *       *       *       *       *

     "There is at this time a third of the Mail Guards ill, either
     from the intenseness of the severe weather or from colds they
     have caught in the floods: their exertions were in general very
     great, and meritorious, in saving the Mails."--(_Times, Feb. 19,
     1795._)

We are here presented with the infancy of Telegraphing--which was then
a marvel of the age--but which we, from our standpoint of Electricity,
must fain smile at. They were mechanical contrivances placed on hills,
or other eminences.

     "The Telegraph.--This mode of communication is little understood
     here, although the invention be not a new one. The process is
     getting possession of _heights_ at convenient distances, and by
     fire-works, in different forms, for different letters, _spelling_
     the order, or intelligence, from station, to station!"--(_Times,
     Sept. 11, 1794._)

       *       *       *       *       *

     "The new mode of correspondence, by the help of which, the
     surrender of _Quesnoy_ was known at Paris an hour after the entry
     of the French troops into that place, is a communication by
     signals, which are repeated from distance, to distance, by
     machines, stationed four, or five, leagues asunder. This may
     explain the celerity with which communications are made.

     "The _telegraph_, now brought into use by the French, appears to
     have been an invention of Dr. Hooper's, and published in his
     Rational Recreations, in 1774. The plan of which may be seen in
     his 'Visual Correspondence.'"--(_Times, Sept. 15, 1794._)

       *       *       *       *       *

     "The invention of the Telegraphe, does not belong alone to the
     French. About ten years ago, Count Possini at Rome, invented a
     mode of getting intelligence from Naples, in the course of an
     hour. The Lottery at Rome, depends upon that drawn at Naples. It
     differs from our Lottery, materially, for there are but six
     prizes, and these are the first six numbers drawn, and the
     remainder are all blanks. The Count, whose house is on an
     eminence near Rome, managed with his confederates, who were
     placed at certain distances, between Naples, and his estate, to
     have sky rockets let off, by which they had previously fixed with
     each other, to ascertain by such signals, any particular number,
     or numbers, drawn. The plan succeeded, as Tickets continued to be
     sold in Rome, for several hours after the drawing commenced at
     Naples, the account of which was always brought by the ordinary
     courier. By this scheme the party got about 100,000 crowns, and
     the plot would never have been discovered, had not the Count
     purchased the whole of the six prizes, which caused suspicion,
     and of course, excited enquiry."--(_Times, Sept. 16, 1794._)

       *       *       *       *       *

     "Astley, who is always employed in the production of something
     new, brings out, this evening, an exhibition of the much talked
     of, and ingenious Machine, called the Telegraphe, at the
     _Lyceum_, in the Strand."--(_Times, Sept. 19, 1794._)

       *       *       *       *       *

     "The invention of the Telegraphe, is now traced back to 1655, and
     particularly mentioned in a little book, then written, and
     published, by the Marquis of Worcester, inventor of the Steam
     Engine. He there gives it the name of _Visual Correspondence_,
     and calls it his own invention."--(_Times, Sept. 20, 1794._)

     "Experiments are now making at Woolwich with a new species of the
     Telegraphe, to ascertain at what distance intelligence can be
     conveyed by it during the night. It is composed of letters, or
     figures, nine feet high, cut out in a board, which is painted
     black in front, and strongly illuminated behind by patent lamps
     with reflectors; it is placed on the top of the butt against
     which the cannon are proved, and proper persons are stationed at
     Purfleet, and other intermediate places, with telescopes, to
     determine at what distance letters of that size are legible at
     night, by which means any word may be written, by a succession of
     letters, and intelligence may be conveyed, with astonishing
     celerity, during the night, by having a series of different
     signal-houses at proper distances between whatever places
     information is intended to be communicated."--(_Times, Oct. 7,

     "It has been said, that a conversation had actually taken place
     across the Channel, between Donaghadee and Port Patrick, by means
     of a Telegraph. The following are the particulars: Two Gentlemen
     of the county of Longford have been, for sometime past, making
     experiments, in different positions, in that county, and they
     succeeded so well, as to induce them to undertake the journey to
     Donaghadee, where the Channel between Britain and Ireland is the
     narrowest, being about 18 Irish miles across. They brought down
     their machinery with them, and, having erected one on each side,
     they conversed with each other, on Monday evening last, the
     weather being tolerably clear. The conversation that passed was
     as follows--The Gentleman on this side said 'I see you, being
     white, distinctly.' The other replied 'I see you; I wish your's
     was white also.' (The machine on this side being black.) The
     Gentleman on this side then asked 'What o'clock is it?' and was
     answered 'Six.' He then said 'I will shew lights at nine o'clock,
     do you attend.' He was answered 'I will attend, but I have only
     one light.' They then made signals of 'good night,' and the
     communication ended. The machine consists of a triangle, with two
     long sides and a short one, suspended in the air vertically; it
     turns on a pivot, and is capable of being put into eight
     different positions, very distinct from each other. These
     positions represent eight of the common numerical figures, and
     these figures, according to their position, denote certain words
     and sentences, according to a preconcerted dictionary, or
     vocabulary, alphabetically, as well as numerically, arranged. It
     is believed this machine is on a principle totally different from
     the French."--(_Times, Sept, 11, 1795._)

     "Telegraphe.--An improvement on this post-haste mode of
     travelling, has been offered to the Administration, by two
     foreigners, who demand £40,000 for the discovery, if it should be
     found to answer; if it does not, like quacks of another
     description, they retire with nothing but the shame of the
     attempt. These foreigners undertake to convey intelligence to all
     parts of the world, by letter as quick as thought. Certain globes
     are to be constructed, that, by the power of electricity and
     attraction, a packet, large as a horse can carry, shall be sent
     to and from Dublin, in about the time requisite for dispatching a
     breakfast!! _Credat Judeus!_"--(_Times, Jan. 12, 1796._)

In or about 1796, was instituted the semaphore telegraph--which,
until the introduction of the Electric Telegraph, was the best system
out.

     "The most important services which can be rendered to the public
     by the Telegraph, is in cases similar to that which occurred last
     week, in forwarding the news from Deal to London, of the sailing
     of the Dutch Fleet, within the space of five minutes. This prompt
     conveyance of the intelligence enabled the Admiralty Board to
     take such speedy measures for sending a fleet out after the
     enemy. When the Telegraph is established between London and other
     ports as well as Deal, the advantage will be very great
     indeed."--(_Times, Mar. 2, 1796._)

     "The English are remarkable for improving upon the inventions of
     their Gallic neighbours. It is well known, that while these
     aerial wanderers were tumbling down like so many Phaetons from
     Heaven, we were driving about securely in balloon-coaches, and
     eating balloon-cakes, and balloon-oysters. The same advantage has
     resulted from the telegraph, which, beside christening a coach,
     and a newspaper, is now transferred to the heads of our ladies,
     and has given us telegraphic hats and telegraphic caps. By this
     invention a female will travel to Edinburgh, through the
     observatory at York, Doncaster, Grantham and Huntingdon, from the
     principal machine in Bond Street, in the time of three Operas, or
     twenty-four Routs."--(_Times, Oct. 15, 1796._)

     "Since the invention of the _Coiffure télégraphique_ it is
     scarcely possible to follow the rapidity of the fashions. The
     morning dress and the evening dress mean literally the dress of
     the day they are worn in. It was observed, with concern, at Drury
     Lane the other evening, that the Lady P's were more than _half an
     hour_ out of fashion."--(_Times, Oct. 21, 1796._)

Among the various tyrannies of fashion, none, perhaps was more curious
than that of powdering the hair. Taxation, and the French _mode_ of
"Cropping" killed it, but it died hard.--The Tax was treated both
jocularly, and _au grand serieux_.

       "Full many a chance, or dire mishap,

     "A tax on Dogs would certainly have been unobjectionable, as well
     as expedient, in a two-fold degree; first in creating a revenue,
     and secondly, in lessening the number of them. At the present
     period particularly, a tax on Dogs would have a good effect, as
     it is a well known fact, that the coarser parts of meat are

     pounds to Government. The term is to be extended by Act of
     Parliament, and, according to the most probable conjectures, the
     final amount will be double that sum.

     "The Duke of Devonshire has paid five and thirty guineas for his
     family. The Duchess of Northumberland, a single guinea for
     herself: powder is under interdiction among the rest of that
     family: though not from motives of disaffection. Her Grace

     "HAIR POWDER. To all those whom it may concern.

     "Among the many ingenious, and humane, projects that have been
     devised for lessening the consumption of Flour, and soothing the
     minds of the poor, at this interesting period, it is a matter of
     no small astonishment to me, that that of sacrificing our
     hair-powder, has not been more universally adopted. To the
     antiquated virgin, indeed, who still sighs, and hopes, and whose
     silvery locks might prove too sure an index of that worldly
     experience, which, for certain prudential reasons, she might wish
     to conceal, I confess the sacrifice is too great to be expected.
     To the unhappy _hen-peck'd bald-pate_, whose lively wife
     nauseates, and detests, the careless _brown-bob_, something may
     be said in his behalf, also: but, to every other character,
     whether the grave judge, or respectable grandmother, the buxom
     widow, or the broad shouldered Irish fortune-hunter, the flirting
     coquette, or her coxcomb colleague, the hardy veteran, or flashy
     militia captain, the pert lawyer, or the young priggish parson:
     and lastly, the smart apprentice, who _beflours_ his head to cut
     a dash at the Dog and Duck, or Bagnigge Wells: all these, I say,
     and every other character that I have omitted to name, can surely
     have no possible excuse for thus insulting the feelings of the
     poor. I repeat the word _insulting_, for it is the just and
     proper epithet; for what can we term it but insult, to be thus
     playing with the feelings of these poor wretches, at a moment
     when they are suffering the greatest of all worldly
     miseries--_want_."--(_Times, Aug. 10, 1795._)

     "A morning Paper of yesterday, mentions by name, that a Nobleman
     of the highest rank, in this country, was, last week, summoned to
     the Police-Office, Queen's Square, for wearing powder without
     being licensed. The defence set up that his Grace, being a
     _Menial Servant_, in the King's Household, was exempt from the
     Tax: which, being admitted, the matter was dismissed.--We trust
     that this information is not authentic, for it would be a most
     pitiful subterfuge to evade the payment of a tax, which is
     generally allowed to be a proper one." (_Times, Feb. 1,

All articles of luxury, and very many of absolute necessity, were
taxed to supply the drain of the war--and, doubtless, people had to be
economical--but the following advertisement reduces economy to a
science:--

On Nov. 22, 1798, Pitt brought forward his annual statement, relating
to public finance--and proposed to raise £7,000,000, by a new tax
called a triple assessment--but, eventually, it turned out that it,
with the land tax, brought in but about 4-1/2 Millions. A Briton can
extract some fun, even out of his misfortunes, so they caricatured
this heavy tax. In Dec. 1797 appeared a picture entitled "More
visitors to John Bull; or the Assessed Taxes"--showing four little
imps coming to John Bull. He naturally asks, "What do you want, you
little devils?--ain't I plagued with enough of you already? more pick
pocket's work, I suppose?" But the _diablotins_ courteously reply,
"Please your honour, we are the Assessed Taxes."

On Dec. 3, 1798, Mr. Pitt again made his annual financial
statement--and, of course, he wanted more money--and the way by which
he proposed to raise the necessary funds--was by imposing a Tax on
Income. He proposed that no income under £60 a year should be
touched--and from that sum, to £200 per annum, should be on a smaller
scale than over £200--past which sum--a full tenth of all incomes
would be demanded. The returns were to be made by the person assessed,
subject to the inspection of a surveyor, who should lay before the
commissioners any grounds he might have for suspecting the return to
be false. The commissioners had no power to call for account books, or
to examine clerks, &c. But, if the individual did not clear himself,
and they thought he had not returned sufficient, they could make such
assessment as they thought fit. After a long debate it was carried by
183 to 17, and made law on 18th Mar. 1799. By the accompanying
caricature, "A Visitor to John Bull, for the year 1799, or the
Assessed Taxes taking their leave," it was evidently the public
impression that the Income Tax would supersede the Assessed Taxes. But
it was not so, as they were still kept on.

The little demons still behave courteously towards John Bull, who
looks in undisguised horror at the size of the awful fund (the Income
Tax) now taking possession of him.

The following paragraph would seem, at first sight, rather harsh--but
it must be borne in mind that the War was a cruel drain on our fiscal
resources--and not one penny that had been granted by parliament could
be bated.

     "The following curious view of the incredible loss sustained by
     raising weekly loans of money, at the Pawnbrokers, it is hoped,
     will prove an additional incitement to frugality; for certain it
     is, that in many instances, 1/6th, and in some cases 1/5th, and
     even as high as 1/4th, of the annual earnings of the more
     thoughtless, and dissolute part, of the poor, is paid for
     temporary accommodations. For instance,

     "The person who borrows 3d. in pawn, pays 6d. a year, interest,

     during the Lottery),

     improvident, as to pawn their Sunday cloaths, every Monday

     "ON PUBLIC-HOUSES. (Condensed.)

     "In the City of London, and within the Bills of Mortality, there
     are at present 5,204 licensed Public Houses, and it is calculated
     that the Beer, and Spirits, which are consumed in these
     receptacles of idleness, and profligacy, by the _labouring
     people_, only, is little short of _three millions sterling a
     year_. It has been lately discovered, that clubs of apprentice
     boys are harboured in Public Houses, for the purpose of
     supporting their brethren who run away from their masters, and of
     indulging themselves early, in scenes of lewdness, and
     drunkenness, which they generally do, by pilfering their masters
     property, and disposing of it at the old iron shops.

       "In a recent publication, the consumption of Ale, and Porter,
         annually, in the metropolis, and its environs, is stated to
         be 1,132,147 barrels, equal to 36,625,145 gallons, making
         158,400,580 pots at 3-1/2d.               £2,311,466 15 10

       "And, by another calculation, the
         average consumption of Gin, and
         Compounds, in Public Houses, previous
         to the stoppage of the distillery,
         was about 3,000,000 of Gallons               975,000  0  0

     "If a conclusion may be drawn from the apparent greater degree of
     sobriety, which is manifested, at present, by the labouring
     people, and evinced by the number of quarrels, and assaults,
     being very considerably diminished, and the pressure, with
     respect to the means of living, apparently less than in the
     spring of 1795, notwithstanding no charities have been
     distributed, and bread is considerably higher, it would seem
     reasonable to attribute this favourable change, to the high price
     of Gin, which, being in a great measure inaccessible, the lower
     ranks have it now in their power, to apply the money, formerly
     spent in this way, to the purchase of provisions, perhaps to the
     extent of some hundred thousands of Pounds a year, in the
     metropolis, alone!"--(_Times, Oct. 4. 1797._)

FOOD.

The years 1795-6 were years of great scarcity, and the graphic daily
accounts of the want of food, and of the various substitutes for
bread--the abstinence of all classes, from the King, to the labourer,
bring very vividly to our minds, a state of things, which has never
since obtained in England--

     "In consequence of the scarcity of Wheat, arising partly from
     such quantities of it being used for hair-powder, several
     regiments have, very patriotically, discontinued the use of
     hair-powder, which, in these instances, was generally nothing but
     flour."--(_Times, Feb. 10, 1795._)

     "The Parliamentary Board of Agriculture, in consideration of the
     probable scarcity of wheat, have agreed to propose a premium of
     One Thousand Pounds, to the person who will grow the largest
     breadth of _Potatoes_, on lands never applied to the culture of
     that plant before:--they have liberally excluded the Members of
     their own Board from becoming candidates for this valuable
     prize."--(_Times, Feb. 14, 1795._)

     "The general failure of Wheat, throughout Europe, last year,
     makes it proper to promote the culture of an increased quantity
     of Potatoes, and, as one means of doing it, it is recommended to
     Noblemen and Gentlemen, who have large Parks, to break up a part
     of them to be planted with Potatoes, those grounds generally
     lying dry, will be very proper for the purpose, and fit for
     immediate planting with that root. It is hoped that so
     benevolent, and patriotic, an object, will be a sufficient
     incitement, without a consideration of profit

     being so dear, left off soup in his family, at present, that the
     making of soup destroys a great deal of meat, and it is
     recommended that the rich leave off making soups, as the meat is
     generally wasted, it will relieve a great many poor families in

     adopted for reducing the price, which, after a few observations,

     4s. 4d., lamb 6s., veal 5s. 8d.

     "If a bounty was to be given on mackarel brought to market, it
     would, in a great measure, tend to lower the price of butchers
     meat, which a ruinous plan of forestalling, and unfair buying and
     selling, has raised to an alarming price.

     "A report from the committee appointed at the last Court of
     Common Council, to consider of the best means of reducing the
     present high price of provisions, was read, giving it as their
     opinion, that encouraging the bringing up fish to Billingsgate,

     "Among the numerous causes which may be assigned for the present
     high prices of provisions, especially of poultry, the uniting of
     many small farms into one great one, is not the least. It is a
     well known fact, that, where three farms have been leased, or
     let, to one tenant, which three farms, antecedently, had each a
     separate tenant, no more poultry is produced by the union, than
     each separately reared, when divided, so that two-thirds are, of
     course, lost to the public. This mode of throwing many small
     farms into one large farm, by having one, instead of a number of
     tenants, however it may profit the landlord, is of very great
     injury to the public, inasmuch as it gives a kind of Aristocracy
     to the farmers, that enables them, in a great measure, to set
     what price they please upon provisions, destroying that
     competition, which is always the consequence, where the venders
     are numerous. Thus it is that a great part of Oxfordshire has
     been bought up by a noble Duke, who, by monopolizing so much

     of Middlesex, the Magistrates assembled, taking into
     consideration the present High Prices of Provisions, with the
     consequent inconveniences resulting therefrom, and, feeling the
     propriety of a general retrenchment in the manner of furnishing
     the Table, at this particular time, have come to the following
     Resolution, viz., That during the remainder of the present
     Session, and during the next Session, in September, no Puddings,
     or Pies, nor any the like articles made of Flour, be served to
     their table, nor any other provisions, whatsoever, than fish,
     beef, mutton, or veal, with vegetables, and household bread.

     "Yesterday, the Directors of the Bank of England sent £500 to the
     Lord Mayor, requesting he would apply that sum towards the relief
     of the industrious poor, in the article of BREAD. The _Sun Fire
     Office_ sent £100, to the same worthy Magistrate, for the like
     purpose. The different Wards in the City have subscribed, very
     liberally, towards the relief of the poor in their present
     distress. Public subscriptions are about to be opened for the
     same benevolent purpose. Pastry, and puddings, have been
     abolished in a number of private houses. The Directors of the
     Bank yesterday came to a resolution to have no more public
     dinners, while the price of provisions continued so high. This
     laudable resolution will, we trust, be followed by all the
     corporate bodies in the kingdom."--(_Times, July 11, 1795._)

     use a technical term) returned to _dine upon a view_. The
     following Epigram was put under the Master's plate:--

       "In times so hard, how happy 'twere
       If thousands, like to you,
       Could glut their craving appetites
       By _dining on--a view_.

     "At the General Quarter Session of the Peace of our Lord the
     King, holden in and for the County of Middlesex ... a Letter from
     his Grace the Duke of Portland, one of her Majesty's Principal
     Secretaries of State, was read, inclosing a copy of the following
     engagement, entered into by several of the Lords of his Majesty's
     most Hon. Privy Council, in the following words:

     "In consideration of the present high Price of Wheat, and, in
     order to diminish the Consumption thereof, in our respective
     Families, so as to leave a larger Supply of this necessary
     Article of Food, for the People in general, until the Corn of the
     ensuing Harvest shall come into Consumption, and relieve them of
     their present difficulties: We, whose Names are hereto
     subscribed, being desirous of introducing into common use a
     wholesome Bread, at a lower price than must be paid for the sort
     of Bread now ordinarily used, do engage that we will not,
     ourselves, consume, nor suffer to be consumed, in any of our
     Families, until the First Day of October next, at any place where
     the sort of Bread undermentioned can be procured, any sort of
     Wheaten Bread finer than that which, in an Act of Parliament
     passed in the 13th year of his present Majesty's Reign, is called
     by the name of Standard Wheaten Bread: which is directed by the
     said Act to be made of the Flour of Wheat, which Flour, without
     any Mixture, or Division, shall be the whole Produce of the
     Grain, the Bran or Hull thereof only excepted, and which shall
     weigh three-fourths parts of the weight of the Wheat whereof it
     shall be made. We further engage to diminish, as much as
     possible, the use of Flour in other articles of Food consumed in
     our respective Families. And we earnestly recommend to all our
     Fellow Subjects, to adopt these Measures, and strictly adhere to
     the same.

     "The want of bread is often more imaginary, than real. There are
     many excellent substitutes for this article, which would in
     themselves be preferred by many people, if it were a matter of
     choice, only, between themselves. Unfortunately, the call for
     bread will always be in proportion to the scarcity of it, from
     the natural disposition of some to make grievances, and
     complaints, and of others to provoke tumult, and riot.

     "To make good bread. Take a pottle of fine oatmeal, and lay it in
     water, to steep, all night: next morning, it will appear (if too
     much water is not put to it) like hasty pudding. This break into
     several parts of a peck and a half of barley-meal, to which add
     warm water, and yeast, and knead it into dough, as all wheat meal
     is commonly done: then mould it into loaves, and bake them. Thus,
     a barley loaf may be made hollow, white, and sweet, so as
     scarcely to be known from coarse wheaten bread. When skimmed milk
     can be had, it will make the bread better still."--(_Times, July

     "COMMON COUNCIL.

     "Yesterday, a Court of Common Council was held at Guildhall, at
     which the Lord Mayor, 6 Aldermen, and about 150 Commoners, were
     present.

     "The Lord Mayor informed the Court, that he had not yet received
     any answer to the application made by desire of that Court to his
     Majesty's Ministers, requesting them to prohibit the use of Hair
     Powder, and Flour, in the Army. It was, however, generally
     understood in the Court, that Government was acting in compliance
     with the wishes of the Court.

     "The Court then proceeded to take into consideration the
     Resolutions of his Majesty's Hon. Privy Council, recommending the
     use of standard wheaten Bread (see the Advertisement in the
     _Times_ of Tuesday last 14th inst.). The Court resolved to adopt,
     and to exert themselves to give force to, the Resolution of the
     Privy Council, and earnestly recommend the same to their fellow
     citizens. A Deputation was appointed to wait on the Privy
     Council, relative to some regulations not clearly understood,
     respecting the Millers forwarding the sort of Flour necessary for
     the purpose to market. It was also the opinion of the Court, that
     the said Deputation should recommend to the Privy Council, to
     take into consideration the propriety of an indemnity to the
     Bakers, in fixing a price to the said Household Bread.

     "Mr. Kemble then made his promised motion for the Court to
     resolve 'That no dinners be allowed, at the expence of the City,
     to the different Committees for managing the concerns of the
     Corporation, for the period of one year.' It was seconded by Mr.
     Herring, when a debate took place, which lasted more than two
     hours. The debate was at length terminated by Mr. Box proposing
     to adopt the words 'till the 1st of October next,' the time fixed
     on, in the Regulations of the Privy Council, as at that period it
     was to be hoped the present scarcity would be removed. And, if it
     was not, the Court could extend the prohibition. The motion, so
     amended, was then put, and carried, by a Majority of SEVENTEEN
     only!!"--(_Times, July 16, 1795._)

     "We offer the following hints for the government of individuals
     in affluent circumstances, with a view of reducing the high price
     of provisions:--

     "To have fish at table as often as possible.

     "To sit down with a determined resolution to eat only of one kind
     of butcher's meat; and, where circumstances will admit, to have
     only one dish of meat at table.

     "To forbid the use of pastry in your own house, and to decline
     the use of it at any other table.

     "To be particularly economical in the use of bread, and to cut,
     yourself, what you use at your own table; making your servants
     sensible that you give such directions from a regard to the
     comforts of the poor, and not from any penurious views. It
     appears, indeed, to be of the utmost consequence to make servants
     in great, and even small families, sensible how much they may,
     under present circumstances, contribute to the relief, and
     comfort, of the poor, which every British heart must wish to do.

     "Bakers ought to be prevented from selling bread of the same
     day's baking, as, on a fair calculation, four stale loaves are
     equal to five new ones."--(_Times, July 16, 1795._)

       *       *       *       *       *

     "At a period when every species of grain has become both scarce,
     and dear, it is the duty of every individual to inform the public
     of any possible diminution in the consumption. It is with this
     view that we feel much satisfaction in announcing to all who keep
     horses for draught, that a saving of _twenty-five per cent._ in
     Oats, has been introduced into the stables of Thrale's Brewhouse,
     in the Borough, since the month of September last, which we are
     happy to learn has been adopted by several other principal
     manufacturers. Their plan is simply to _roll all their oats_
     between two iron cilinders, which they have attached to their
     steam engine. By this process, an _increase_ is found of two
     bushels a _sack_. After being well rolled (which is usually done
     twice, or thrice, a week) the Oats are _mixed with chaff_ of the
     best quality, and divided in the usual manner. This mode of
     rolling, is deemed equal to mastication. It is found, from
     experience, equally beneficial to _old_ horses, whose teeth may
     be impaired, as well as _young_ horses, who often return home
     very hungry, and are apt to swallow their oats without chewing
     them, by which means they are frequently observed to pass through
     them undigested."--(_Times, July 16, 1795._)

       *       *       *       *       *

     "It is now almost the prevailing custom in every family of
     distinction, to have the loaf brought on the table, and each
     person to help himself. This example must have a considerable
     influence in reducing the consumption of this, as well as other,
     necessaries of life.

     "The custom of wearing Hair-Powder is growing into very general
     disuse: and we shall not be surprised if we soon see it almost
     altogether abolished, during the present scarcity of grain.

     "The recommendation of the Privy Council, to adopt the use of
     Household Bread, will be of little avail, unless their _request_
     is converted into an _order_, that no bread, above that standard,
     shall hereafter be baked: and every idea of expediency, and
     common policy, demands that some measure of this tendency should
     immediately be enforced."--(_Times, July 17, 1795._)

     "There is no economy more laudable at this moment, than that of
     lessening the consumption of bread, in private families. This has
     been practised with such success, by Mr. Parish, on Ludgate Hill,
     that he now consumes but four Brown loaves per week, in lieu of
     twelve, or thirteen, White ones, as formerly. This is a most
     notable example, and, we trust, will be imitated by many, though
     perhaps with somewhat less rigour. Mr. P.'s substitute for bread,
     are, principally, potatoes, and rice."--(_Times, July 18, 1795._)

     "In Sussex, the Gentry have adopted the most rational mode of
     diminishing the price of Corn. Instead of supplying the poor with
     bread, at a low price, which can only tend to increase the
     consumption, they give pickled pork, &c., to an equal amount,
     which, with the use of cabbage, beans, &c., may banish, without
     much suffering, the loaf, at least, from their dinner
     tables."--(_Times, July 20, 1795._)

       *       *       *       *       *

     "After the humane example of the City, in leaving off their
     annual feasts, we are happy to find it is _intended_ to be
     universally adopted by the surrounding parishes, and opulent
     families; _particularly_ by some of the principal inhabitants of
     _Whitechapel_, who, at one of their Greenwich meetings, on
     Monday, wisely determined to eat venison, and white-bait, _no
     longer than the season will produce them_."--(_Times, July 22,

[Illustration: A pretty Bar-maid.]

Some of the following set of moral rules might be followed with
advantage at the present day:--

     "THE WAY TO PEACE AND PLENTY.

     Rules for the rich.

     1. Abolish gravy soups, and second courses.

     2. Buy no starch when wheat is dear.

     3. Destroy all useless dogs.

     4. Give no dog, or other animal, the _smallest bit_ of bread or
     meat.

     5. Save all your skim-milk carefully, and give it all to the
     poor, or sell it at a cheap rate.

     6. Make broth, rice pudding, &c., for the poor, and teach them to
     make such things.

     7. Go to church yourselves, and take care your servants go
     constantly.

     8. Look into the management of your own families, and visit your
     poor neighbours.

     9. Prefer those poor who keep steadily to their work, and go
     constantly to church, and give nothing to those who are idle, and
     riotous, or keep useless dogs.

     10. Buy no weighing meat, or gravy beef: if the rich would buy
     only the prime pieces, the poor could get the others cheap.


     Rules for the Poor.

     1. Keep steadily to your work, and never change masters, if you
     can help it.

     2. Go to no gin-shop, or alehouse: but lay out all your earnings
     in food, and cloaths, for yourself, and your family: and try to
     lay up a little for rent, and rainy days.

     3. Avoid bad company.

     4. Keep no dogs: for they rob your children, and your neighbours.

     5. Go constantly to church, and carry your wives, and children,
     with you, and God will bless you.

     6. Be civil to your superiors, and they will be kind to you.

     7. Learn to make broth, milk pottage, rice-pudding, &c. One
     pound of meat, in broth, will go further than two pounds boiled,
     or roasted.

     8. Be quiet, and contented, and never steal, or swear, or you
     will never thrive."--(_Times, July 23, 1795._)

     "Yesterday, the _Stationers'_ Company had their annual dinner, at
     Stationers' Hall. Having determined, in consequence of the great
     scarcity of flour, to abolish the use of pies, they contented
     themselves with several haunches of venison, and a number of
     _venison pasties_, which consumed flour enough for 50 fruit pies.
     And in order to adopt the above resolution of no pies, the Court
     of Assistants had, previously, a snug dinner, consisting of all
     the delicacies of the season. Of public dinners, those of the
     Stationers Company rival every other. We have not yet heard of
     the Company having contributed anything to the relief of the
     poor."--(_Times, Aug. 14, 1795._)

     "One among the serious consequences of the dearness of
     provisions, is, that the price of board in schools, is
     considerably raised. There are few schools of repute, that have
     not raised their terms, at least five guineas a year."--(_Times,

     "The price of butter, in all parts of the country, has been,
     lately, most shamefully advanced, without any cause to justify
     the measure. The season has, hitherto, been favourable to
     grazing, and the war cannot extend its influence to our dairies.
     On the same principle, the late advance in the price of Milk, in
     the Metropolis, should be enquired into. London is supplied with
     Milk by about 30 cow-keepers, who may at pleasure either deprive
     the city of this necessary article, or extort what price they may
     think proper for it. Milk should be made subject to the
     regulations respecting bread, beer, &c., as, indeed, should every
     similar commodity."--(_Times, Feb. 15, 1796._)

     "In consequence of the public refraining to buy fresh butter, the
     price fell from 14-1/2d. to 9d. and 10d. per pound, in Sheffield
     Market, last week. And so it would be in London, if every family
     would consent to buy Cambridge butter, for a few days, or to
     allow only half the quantity of fresh to be taken in, which is
     usually consumed."--(_Times, Mar. 2, 1796._)

     "The Beef Trade, though it declined a market day, or two, in the
     heat of the weather, is nearly up again to its enormous Spring
     prices: a good bullock being now worth 4s. 6d. per stone. Veal,
     Mutton, and Lamb, are getting down, but Pork still fetches 10s. a
     score. Lean stock, of every kind, is excessively dear, and
     difficult to be obtained, on any terms, that of the sheep kind,

     "The great importance of the Distilleries, in the article of
     fatted hogs, may be judged of, in some degree, by the number
     turned out of the distilleries, in Surrey alone, which are
     estimated at 11,700 a year, valued at £46,215, besides the great
     number fed in the starch yards. It is said, that all the
     distilleries in the Kingdom, when in full work, send to market,
     weekly, near 30,000 hogs: during the last year, they were at a
     total stand, and the price of bacon has been enormous."--(_Times,
     Oct. 26, 1796._)

Some of the great ones of the land set a good example of economy to
their poorer brethren--the King among the number.

     "The Margrave of Anspach sets a princely example of economy to
     his betters: his table is furnished by contract, and the daily
     expence exceeds not half-a-guinea per head. Of course, the
     purveyor takes the needful care of broken victuals: whilst Sir
     Harry, and the Duke's servant, fare equally alike in that larder,
     where Miss _Kitty_ or Mrs. _Cook_ have nought to give, but bread
     and cheese, and kisses."--(_Times, June 22, 1795._)

     "His Majesty has given orders for the bread used in his
     household, to be made of meal, and rye, mixed. No other sort is
     permitted to be baked, and the Royal Family eat bread of the same
     quality as their servants do. It is extremely sweet, and
     palatable.

     "One half flour, and half potatoes, also make a very excellent
     bread."--(_Times, July 22, 1795._)

       *       *       *       *       *

     "The writer of this paragraph has seen the bread that is eaten
     at His Majesty's table. It consists of two sorts only, the one
     composed of wheaten flour, and rye, mixed; the other is half
     wheaten flour, half potatoe flour. If ever example deserved
     imitation, it is surely this."--(_Times, July 30, 1795._)

The Court of Aldermen had the power of apportioning the price of bread
according to the price of wheat--thus affording the baker a fair
profit, and protecting the consumer.

     "Yesterday, a Court of Aldermen was held at Guildhall, which came
     to a resolution to raise the price of bread to a Shilling the
     Quartern Loaf."--(_Times, July 8, 1795._)

     "Tuesday, a Court of Aldermen was held at Guildhall. The Court

     loaf.

     in Salt, for an advance, were pleased to order the price of salt
     to be fixed as follows, viz., 8s. per bushel, 4s. per half ditto,
     2s. per peck, 1s. per half ditto, 6d. per quarter ditto, 3d. per
     half-quarter peck, 2d. per pound, 1d. per half ditto."--(_Times,

     "Assize of Bread.

     "The regulation of the Assize of Bread being generally
     misunderstood, the following tables, extracted from the Act of
     Parliament of the 31st Geo. II. will at once shew, by what
     authority, the Magistrates regulate the Price of Bread, with the
     allowance to Bakers of 1s. 6d. per bushel for wheat, and 10s. per
     sack for flour: a reference to which tables, will enable every
     person to ascertain the price of the quartern, and peck, loaf,
     as well as the Magistrates themselves: and will prove that the
     letter of the law, and not the will of the Magistrates, regulates
     that necessary article. At the same time, the public will be
     convinced, that the average price of flour is more in favour of
     the consumer, than that of wheat. For example--the average price
     of wheat, this day, is 9s. per bushel. The allowance to the
     baker, is 1s. 6d. The quartern loaf would then be 1s.--whereas,
     the average price of flour being 63s. and 4d., the Magistrates
     are enabled to make the Assize of Bread 11d. instead of 1s.

The Aldermen also had the power of visiting the bakers' shops within
their Wards, of fining dishonest bakers, and distributing their bread,
gratis, to the poor,--a summary, and most effectual, way of dealing
with the rogues.

     "Wednesday, a cheap Baker in Bishopsgate-Ward was fined, by the
     Lord Mayor, 5s. per ounce, on 16 ounces short weight, in seven
     quartern, and nine penny loaves, taken by the inquest of that
     Ward from out of his shop."--(_Times, March 29, 1793._)

       *       *       *       *       *

     "Saturday Mr. Justice Russell, and the Peace Officers of
     Greenwich, went to all the bakers, and weighed their bread, to
     find out if the poor, and other inhabitants, had their due
     weight: when many loaves, found deficient in weight, were
     immediately given away at the doors of the bakers to those poor
     persons who were not under any relief from the parish."--(_Times,
     Jan. 12, 1795._)

       *       *       *       *       *

     "Monday, in consequence of an information, Mr. Justice Addington,
     attended by several officers, went to a Baker's shop, in Holborn,
     where they found 70 loaves, short of the standard weight, 181
     ounces. The Magistrate fixed the penalty of 5s. per ounce, which
     amounted to £45, 5s., but which was mitigated to £40. The
     Magistrate, and officers, then went to a Baker's in Little
     Turnstile, and found 54 loaves short of the standard, 142 ounces,
     amounting at 5s. an ounce to £36, but which was mitigated to £30.
     The loaves were distributed to the poor in the neighbourhood of
     Covent Garden."--(_Times, July 8, 1795._)

       *       *       *       *       *

     "A Baker was convicted, yesterday, at the Public Office,
     Whitechapel, of making Bread, to the amount of 307 ounces,
     deficient in weight, and fined in the penalty of £64,
     7s."--(_Times, Aug. 27, 1796._)

       *       *       *       *       *

     420 ounces of bread, deficient in weight."--(_Times, Aug. 30,
     1796._)

       *       *       *       *       *

     "On Thursday a great deal of bread was brought before Alderman
     Cadell, by the Inquest of one of the City Wards, being under the
     regular standard of weight. The Alderman ordered the loaves to be
     all weighed before him, and desired the Bakers who were present,
     to attend to the weights.

     "The Bakers expressed their sorrow for it, and said it was an
     accident occasioned by the carelessness of their Journeymen, in
     suffering it to be an hour too long in the oven. They not
     bringing the men forward, to substantiate the defence, the
     Alderman told them he should fine them the full penalty, of five
     shillings an ounce, for all deficient; which came to above
     _twenty pounds_, besides the forfeiture of the bread. Mr. Kirby,
     the Keeper of Newgate, being present, solicited part of it, for
     his prisoners. Some of the Inquest likewise solicited the bread,
     for the poor of their ward: but the Alderman told them that half
     of the penalty came to them, which would compensate for the
     bread."--(_Times, Nov. 30, 1799._)

"Forestalling" and "Regrating" were heinous sins.--They consisted in
buying any thing on its way to market, before it had been exposed for
public sale--and in purchasing at any market at one price, and selling
it again at a higher.

     "In consequence of the serious enquiry making into the infamous
     practices of the salesmen, in Smithfield market, and the
     conviction of a leading man among them, for regrating, mutton,
     and lamb, fell 1-1/2d. per pound, in Friday, and yesterday's,
     market. If the Magistrates would but exert themselves, to put in
     force the laws against monopolizers, and forestallers, provisions
     would soon be at a moderate price, as we are convinced there is
     no _real_ scarcity: and are of opinion that the farmers and
     graziers, who are now holding back their corn, and cattle, will
     experience the fate of those, who, in the hard weather, refused
     to sell their potatoes under 2-1/2d. per lb., and now cannot get
     1/2d. per lb., but have the well deserved prospect of being
     obliged to give them to the hogs, for want of a
     consumption."--(_Times, May 26, 1795._)

       *       *       *       *       *

     "HIGH PRICE OF MEAT. This alarming circumstance is not owing to
     any real scarcity of oxen, sheep, or hogs, but, partly, to a
     combination among the carcass-butchers in the wholesale markets,
     and the salesmen in Smithfield, who fix the prices, and who
     regulate what quantity of cattle shall come to town: and,
     partly, to a very shameful practice among the retail butchers,
     especially where a contract is made to supply a family at so much
     per pound for the year. When the butcher has made his contract at
     5d., 5-1/2d., or 6d., he can make a very great profit, although,
     as is now the case, he can purchase a carcass at 7-1/2d. in the
     wholesale markets: and the mode by which he does this, is in
     defrauding his customers of the due weight, to which the person,
     who attends to see the meat weighed, too often connives at, for a
     Christmas present, or an Easter gift. The weight, no doubt is in
     the scale, at the time of weighing: but when the meat is put by,
     in order to be sent home, a considerable part is purloined: and
     it is a well known fact, that, in these large lots, the same leg
     of beef(?) has been weighed to, perhaps, ten or twelve families,
     in the same day, and not sent to any of them. The leg is
     considered as the most convenient for this theft, because it is
     so large, and is, when weighed with the lot, hung on the end of
     the beam of the scales, from whence it is taken down, and thrown,
     not where it ought, with the meat, but to another part of the
     shop. If this was not the case, how is it possible that a butcher
     can make a livelihood, when he buys 2d. per pound dearer than he
     sells? The fact speaks for itself. The mode which all families
     should adopt, is to weigh their meat when it is sent
     home."--(_Times, July 3, 1795._)

       *       *       *       *       *

     "A few days ago, 11 acres of growing wheat, belonging to the Duke
     of Hamilton, in Scotland, were sold at £20 per acre. This species
     of forestalling, we fear, is now too generally attempted, which
     is evidently most injurious to the community, viz., 'to buy corn
     growing in the fields.' This practice, surely, has a direct, and
     apparent, tendency to enhance the present price of corn: also,
     that of 'selling corn in the sheaf.' We think it expedient,
     however, to notify, that both these practices are deemed highly
     criminal by the 'common law of England,' and for which the
     offenders may be indicted, and punished, as they deserve, with
     great severity, viz., by fines, pillory, and imprisonment. See
     _Inst. 197_: also _Hawk_ c. 30."--(_Times, Aug. 19, 1795._)

     "The contrivances to keep up the price of wheat, having been
     discovered, and defeated, we hope the attention of the worthy
     Chief Magistrate will now be directed towards some plan for the
     relief of the Metropolis, against the extortion of the Graziers,
     and Salesmen, in Smithfield Market. The prices of the latter, on
     Monday, were higher than almost ever remembered, and mutton is
     now sold at 7-1/2d. per lb. What real cause there is for such
     extravagant prices, after such a mild winter, is a matter we are
     at a loss to account for."--(_Times, April 13, 1796._)

       *       *       *       *       *

     "An action for regrating, in Smithfield Market, is now pending in
     the Court of Common Pleas: against one of the five brothers, who
     have so long supported themselves, and their families, by jobbing
     in Cattle at that Market. A Carcass Butcher, in Whitechapel, is
     also in dread of a similar action, the penalties on which will be
     very heavy, as it is for purchasing near 70 oxen, on a Friday,
     driving them to his farm, near Clapton, and bringing them to
     Smithfield, for sale, on the following Monday."--(_Times, Nov.
     29, 1796._)

Before this time of Scarcity, however, the good folks did not deny
themselves luxuries of the table, nor, seemingly, care what they paid
for them.

     "The first _green peas_ which have been produced this season,
     were sold, on Monday, in Covent Garden market, at _twelve
     shillings_ per pottle."--(_Times, April 17, 1793._)

       *       *       *       *       *

     "As a proof of the forwardness of the season, green peas have
     already made their appearance in Covent Garden market, where they
     are retailed to the _curious in vegetables_ at the moderate price
     of _two guineas a quart_."--(_Times, March 1, 1794._)

       *       *       *       *       *

     "The Fishmongers Company are such jolly _soles_, as to have
     annually nine quarts of peas at a guinea a quart."--(_Times, May

     "Lemons have attained a price never before arrived at in London,
     namely, ninepence each; buying them wholesale, the price is at
     the rate of from 6d. to 8d. each. About 400,000 were imported
     during the week from St. Ubes, and as a large supply is daily
     expected, the prices must of course fall."--(_Times, Jany. 2,

It may be interesting to some to learn when Sea Kale first came into
use.

     Advt.--"SEA-KALE, a new Culinary Vegetable----Mr. Curtis
     respectfully informs the Nobility and Gentry, that the small
     quantity of Sea-Kale fit for the table, which he has to dispose
     of this season, will by his appointment, be sold by Messrs.
     Dickson and Anderson, Seedsmen, Covent Garden Market, to whom he
     will continue to send it daily, fresh cut, for the short period
     it may last. Printed directions for dressing it, are tied up with
     each bundle."--(_Times, April 30, 1795._)

In the subjoined advertisement we learn the prices, and qualities, of
various Wines, and the list gives us all the information required to
find out the different sorts of wine then drank.

     "At Priddy's Foreign Warehouse, and Vaults, No. 14 Poland St., a
     large quantity of the following Wines, &c., which being, himself,
     the Importer of, can warrant genuine, at the following prices,

Coals, though, of course, not an article of Food, were undoubtedly of
use in cooking it: and may therefore be mentioned here. Our
Grandfathers paid very dearly for them: but it must be remembered
there was no land carriage, and a continued contrary wind, or a "hot
press," would leave the London Market bare. The magnificent basins of
Inland Coals were scarcely known, and only those like the Moira
Collieries, near to a Canal, could be worked. They were sold to the
consumer at per Chaldron of 2800 lbs., and the prices below quoted
represent them ex-ship. Add to this the cost of delivery and profit
12s., and take the Sovereign as being worth 30s., and it will much
account for the small stoves then in vogue.

     "The price of Coals in the Pool, yesterday, were:--Best 43s.
     Inferior sorts from 36s. to 38s. Delivered to housekeepers 49s.
     to 44s. The price rose considerably yesterday from a report that
     several colliers had been captured."--(_Times, Feby. 12, 1793._)

       *       *       *       *       *

     "COAL EXCHANGE.

     "On Monday the price was 70s. per Chaldron all sorts.

     On Wednesday, the price was 60s. and some sorts lower.

     On Yesterday, the price was 50s. to 45s. per Chaldron.

     We are happy at giving such an agreeable account to our
     readers."--(_Times, March 7, 1794._)

       *       *       *       *       *

     "The prices of Coals still continue very high, notwithstanding
     above 100 ships have, this week, arrived at market, which are
     nearly all sold from 38s. to 44s. per Chaldron: so that the best
     sorts cannot be fairly delivered under 50s. per Chaldron. The
     number of ships taken out of the trade, into the transport, and
     other services, is the cause of the present high price, as the
     demand is greater than the supply."--(_Times, Oct. 4, 1794._)

       *       *       *       *       *

     "Many complaints have been made of the high price of coals, and
     it is supposed to arise from a combination, but we are well
     assured no such cause exists. The long frost having stopped the
     navigation of the Thames, what coals remained in the lighters,
     and barges, were nearly exhausted at the wharfs, and naturally,
     every man possessed of a commodity, looks to extraordinary
     profits on unusual events, which has, we understand, occasioned
     six, and seven, guineas to be given for a chaldron of coals,
     within a few days past, but, had the frost continued, coals would
     have been considerably cheaper, than at present, as the ice
     admitted the coals being worked over it. There are, at present,
     near 50 sail of colliers in the river, not unladen, which contain
     about 10,000 chaldrons, for an immediate supply, (but not ten
     times that quantity, as erroneously stated in most of the papers)
     and, before they can be consumed, we may expect a fresh fleet at
     Market."--(_Times, Jany. 30, 1795._)

     "Coals were on Friday (_12th April_) sold in the Pool at five
     guineas per Chaldron. There was only one ship-load at
     market."--(_Times, April 15, 1799._)


THE ROAD AND STREETS.

The Highways and Streets were in very far from good condition, the
roads being full of ruts, and the streets when paved, were made of
large "Cobble" Stones, and were full of holes, ofttimes very
dangerous, as we shall see. The foot pavement, except in some of the
best streets, which were flagged, was very narrow, and made of
"Kidney" stones on end, such as may still be met with in the bye-ways
of some country towns. Consequently no one stirred out more than they
could help; the men always on horseback, if single--by "Post," if
accompanied by ladies. It will have been noticed in "Men's dress"
that they all wear boots, if not in the house, and the reason is
plain--they had to be protected against the mud of the streets, and
ready for the saddle. Every man had to learn to ride, and no doubt
this laid the foundation of the Continental opinion, that every
Englishman is a good horseman.

     "Young Gentlemen during their Holidays, are supplied with gentle
     pleasant Horses of all sizes, and the most careful Attendance and
     Instructions for £2 12 6

     "Advt.--_A CAUTION_ to all Gentlemen who drive Jobb Horses by
     their own Coachmen, the Gentleman paying yearly wages to them:
     From a Gentleman who has had experience of it.--That the
     Coachmaster and Coachmen do agree, the one to give, the other to
     receive, annually, a certain sum of money, which can be for no
     other purpose than to defraud their employers, demanding so much
     more for the price of their horses, to bribe the said Coachmen to
     conceal defects in them, and to engage the said Coachmaster to
     recommend the said Coachmen: and so vice-versa to employ each
     other, if out of place or business. This is a most dishonest, but
     general practice of the Coachmasters. The writer of this, to
     avoid and discourage the practice of this Knavery, has purchased
     his own horses, persuaded no other means will be effectual. This
     is written merely to put Gentlemen on their guard, at the expense
     of the Advertiser, and will not be inserted again."--(_Times,

Of course those that could afford it travelled Post--which was charged
one shilling per horse per mile, besides a gratuity to the "boy," but
this was raised to fourteen pence in 1796, when food became so dear.

     "So great is the itch of pleasure at this time of year, that on
     Sundays it is difficult to find post-horses in London. Last
     Sunday General _Fox_, and several other persons of Consideration,

     though they sent as far as the extremity of
     Whitechapel."--(_Times, Sept. 2, 1795._)

       *       *       *       *       *

     "The rate of _Posting_ still continues at 14d. per mile, and
     nothing but the unanimous determination of the public to resist
     so extravagant a charge, can possibly do it away. Some few Post
     Masters have, it is true, advertised at 1s., but the general rate
     still remains at 14d. This charge took its rise from the
     scarcity, and, consequently, the high price of corn: but, at this
     moment, when corn has fell one third, nothing can justify the
     continuance of what may be justly reprobated as an
     _imposition_."--(_Times, July 9, 1796._)

But it was not every one who could afford Posting or even the Stage
Coach,--for them existed the "Stage Wagon"--a most cumbrous affair
with very broad wheels--and some eight horses, the driver being
mounted on a pony--so as to be able to ride round his team. The
following is a very humorous story of a journey by Wagon:--

     "A DELIGHTFUL RIDE,

     "In the ten-wheeled Caravan, from Greenwich to London.

     "We were twenty-four passengers within side, and nine without. It
     was my lot to sit in the middle, with a very lusty woman on one
     side, and a very thin man on the other. 'Open the window,' said
     the former, and she had a child on her lap, whose hands and face
     were all besmeared with gingerbread. 'It can't be opened,' said a
     little prim coxcomb, 'or I shall get cold.'--'But I say it
     shall, Sir,' said a Butcher, who sat opposite to him, and the
     Butcher opened it; but, as he stood, or rather bent forward to do
     this, the caravan came into a rut, and the Butcher's head, by the
     suddenness of the jolt, came into contact with that of the woman
     who sat next to me, and made her nose bleed. He begged her
     pardon, and she gave him a slap on the face that sounded through
     the whole caravan. Two sailors, that were seated near the helm of
     this machine, ordered the driver to cast anchor at the next
     public-house. He did so; and the woman next to me, called for a
     pot of ale, which she offered to me, after she had emptied about
     a pint of it, observing, that 'as how she loved ale mightily.' I
     could not drink, at which she took much offence; and said, 'I was
     mighty squeamish; but thank God, she was as good as I, and kept a
     lodging-house in Craven St., where she saw _her betters_ every
     day, and so,' continues she, 'here's to you, my dear:' and she
     finished the pot. A violent dispute now arose between two stout
     looking men, the one a Recruiting Sergeant, and the other a
     Gentleman's Coachman, about the _Rights of Man_: and, having
     struck two or three blows in the Caravan, they got out into the
     road, to decide whether _Tom Paine_ was an _Atheist_, or a
     _Deist_. In this contest, victory fell to the Sergeant, and the
     driver of the horses was so mauled by the leader of men, that he
     was lifted into the vehicle, where he sat in sullen silence all
     the rest of the journey.

     "Another dispute afterwards arose about politics, which was
     carried on with such warmth, as to draw the attention of the
     company to the head of the Caravan, where the combatants sat
     wedged together like two pounds of Epping butter, whilst a child
     incessantly roared at the opposite side, and the mother abused
     the two politicians for frightening her babe. The heat was now so
     great that all the windows were opened, and with the fresh air,
     entered clouds of dust, for the body of the machine is but a few
     inches from the surface of the road.

     "I trust, Mr. Conductor, you will give this journey to London, a
     place in your paper, and, I am, &c. &c.

                                         "Lucy Treadneedle."

     --(_Times, Sept. 5, 1794._)

It will be noticed that then, as now, the _Times_, was a powerful organ
for calling public attention to social grievances, and that people
"wrote to" that paper as at the present time. We, in our time, know
the little social inconveniences arising from staying at Hotels,
where, not only does the proprietor charge for attendance, which we,
no more than the writer of this letter, can understand is not included
in his servants' wages--but we, also, if we want good attendance, have
to "tip" the servants as well.

     "To the CONDUCTOR of the TIMES.

     "Sir,--Having frequent occasion to travel many of the principal
     roads of England, I have often witnessed the exorbitant demands
     of Inn-keepers, and the no less serious ones of their domestics,
     sanctioned only by custom, yet arisen to such a pitch as to
     become a burthen unable to be borne by the _poor Tradesman_ who
     is obliged to travel to sell his goods, as well as an
     inconvenience to the person in _middling circumstances_ of
     _life_, who, for his health, or otherwise, has occasion to
     travel. Grievances (the latter of which especially), are only
     suffered to exist from the disinclination people have to break
     through a custom, or to appear singular. Having hinted at the
     former, I shall only shew the nature, and point out a remedy for
     the latter. It is well known, that let an Innkeeper's bill be
     ever so exorbitant, you must not only comply with it, but also
     give the servants just as much as if it was reasonable: so that
     there is no end of the expence: for instance, if a man who has a
     horse, puts up at an inn, besides the usual bill, he must at
     least give 1_s._ to the waiter, 6_d._ to the chamber-maid, 6_d._
     to the hostler, and 6_d._ to the jack-boot, making together 2_s._
     6_d._, and this to be repeated every night he lays on the road (I
     speak now of what's expected from those who appear in middling
     circumstances of life). The same expence in proportion occurs in
     the course of the day: at breakfast, you must give at least 6_d._
     between the waiter and hostler. If the traveller only puts up to
     have a refreshment, besides paying for his horse's standing, he
     must give 3_d._ to the hostler: at dinner 6_d._ to the waiter and
     3_d._ to the hostler: at tea 6_d._ between them, so that he gives
     away in the day 2_s._ 6_d._, which added to the 2_s._ 6_d._ for
     the night, makes 5_s._ per day on an average to servants. Thus he
     is putting his hand in his pocket from morning till night, not
     merely to satisfy the Landlord's demand, but to appease the
     croaking of domestics, who, it is well known, will let you see,
     or feel, their displeasure in some way or other if you do not, so
     that it is disagreeable to go to that inn the second time where
     you do not behave with profuseness at the first, and there is
     not only the above inconvenience, but also this, that after all
     your givings they are not satisfied, but often abuse you for your
     liberality. The following anecdote proves this:--Coming home from
     Colchester some time since, I put up at an Inn at Ingatestone,
     the Innkeeper's bill was as follows:--Supper 1_s._, beer 3_d._,
     bed 1_s._, horse and corn 1_s._ 7_d._--together 3_s._ 10_d._ I
     gave away as follows: waiter 1_s._, chambermaid 6_d._, jack-boot
     6_d._, hostler, the change out of 2_s._ I paid him for the horse,
     being 5_d._, together 2_s._ 5_d._, being 1_s._ 5_d._ less than
     the bill. Yet the hostler was so abusive, because I did not give
     him more than the odd 5_d._ change, that he actually threatened
     me that he would mark me if I came there again. I therefore did,
     what I wish every one would do in the like case, punish him on
     the spot for his insolence. I appeared to relent that I had not
     given him more, and desired him to give me the half-pence again
     that I might see for silver for him, which after he had done, I
     rode off, leaving him to repent he had not kept what I first gave
     him. It may be alleged that these servants have little or no
     wages, and therefore ought to receive liberally. Be that as it
     may, it is very hard that I am to pay wages to another man's
     servants. I pay the master his bill, in which he makes a charge
     sufficient to cover his servants' wages, and then he leaves me to
     pay his servants besides. If Innkeepers have nothing to pay for
     servants, their charges ought to be reasonable in proportion. But
     I would meet another objection that is likely to be made, which
     is, that what is given to servants at inns is not to be
     considered as wages, but as their perquisites. There are two
     answers to this, the one, that the very notion of perquisites,
     signifies something gotten over and above their usual wages,
     whereas it is notorious, that most Innkeepers allow their
     servants no wages: the other, that perquisites signify a gift,
     now a gift is free, and may be much, or little, as suits the
     inclination of the giver, but, according to the modern custom at
     inns, he is not permitted to use his discretion, but there must
     be a settled sum given to each servant, fixed as to the lowest
     quantum, though as much above that mark as he pleases, and, if he
     gives less than custom warrants, they have the impudence to tell
     him of it. Besides, why should Innkeepers, be exempted from
     paying their servants wages, any more than any other tradesman.
     If I go into a shop, to buy a few yards of any thing, I am not
     charged so much for the trouble of the shopman who cut it off.
     Tradesmen are contented to pay their servants out of the profit
     of their bills, without saddling it upon their customers: and I
     am fully persuaded, were travellers of all descriptions to
     withhold for a certain time their usual gifts to servants at
     inns, it would ultimately tend to the benefit of those servants
     themselves, as well as the comfort of travellers, for when the
     servants find their finances so low, they would insist upon, and
     would not hire themselves without stipulated wages, after which,
     travellers might again resume their former generosity, and what
     they then gave, would be looked upon in the light it ought, as a
     gift, and not a debt.

     --(_Times, Oct. 17, 1795._)

The following notices will show that, what with over-crowding, and bad
roads, accidents were as frequent by road as they are now by
rail--indeed, the per centage, considering the relative number of
passengers, was much greater. The _basket_ mentioned below, was a huge
wicker work machine attached to the Coach, intended to carry parcels.

     "Yesterday the driver of the Chelmsford and London Stage Coach,
     was convicted before the Magistrates at the Public Office,
     Whitechapel, in three separate penalties of 40_s._ each, for
     suffering more than six persons to ride on the roof of the said
     Coach.

     "The owner and driver of the Bishop Stortford, and London, Stage
     Coach, was also convicted in the penalty of £4 for the same
     offence: and the driver of the Westham Stage Coach, in the same
     penalty, for suffering eight persons to ride on the roof of the
     said Coach."--(_Times, Oct. 5, 1795._)

       *       *       *       *       *

     "In despite of continual and fatal accidents, not to mention the
     inferior consideration of pains and penalties, the Stage Coaches
     still continue to carry extra numbers on the outside. There were
     _eleven_ on the coach, and box, of the Gosport Coach, beside the
     driver, and _nine_ in the basket, on Thursday last."--(_Times,
     Oct. 16, 1795._)

       *       *       *       *       *

     "The pavement in Bridge St. Blackfriars, which has been so long
     in a most dangerous state, has sunk near a foot more, within the
     last week, so that the roof of the main shore is every hour
     expected to give way."--(_Times, Aug. 6, 1794._)

       *       *       *       *       *

     "On Wednesday afternoon, about four o'clock, the Boston Coach
     broke down, on the lowest part of Snow Hill, soon after it left
     the Saracen's Head Inn. The outside passengers, which were
     FOURTEEN in number, and mostly soldiers, were thrown with such
     violence on the pavement, that several were bruised, and one
     woman was taken to St. Bartholomew's Hospital, where she died, on
     Thursday night. The inside passengers, which were five, and a
     young child, were not much hurt.

     "The frequent accidents which arise from the outsides of coaches
     being so overladen, calls highly for reprehension. The laws are
     either inadequate to remedy the evil, or they are not properly
     enforced: and we sincerely hope that the coachman, and those who
     are concerned, will be severely punished, as an example to
     prevent the same accidents in future. We think there should be a
     fresh Act of Parliament, and, if the inside passengers were
     empowered, after taking their seats, to hire a post-chaise where
     there was above a stipulated number (at the owner's expence), it
     would remedy the evil."--(_Times, Aug. 8, 1795._)

       *       *       *       *       *

     "The pavement in Bridge St. Blackfriars, still grows worse, and
     worse, and not the least notice is taking of it by the Paving
     Committee. This is a most scandalous act of neglect; as,
     publicly, and privately, the parties have been applied to, who
     ought to make the necessary repairs. The ground has now sunk near
     three feet. In so well regulated a city, as that of London, this
     is a most disgraceful business."--(_Times, Oct., 16, 1799._)

       *       *       *       *       *

     "A few days since, the axle-tree of a carriage was broken in
     descending the slope of Blackfriars Bridge, in consequence of the
     very large hole, at the bottom of it, on the Surry-side, which is
     in the highest degree dangerous. We are not certain that an
     indictment would not lay against the Trustees of the Surry Roads,
     for the scandalous manner in which they are kept. They vie with
     the Paviours, in some parts of the City, and we know not which
     are the worst of them. It is not to be conceived the number of
     horses that are foundered, by holes in the streets, and
     roads."--(_Times, Oct. 5, 1799._)

       *       *       *       *       *

     "From the dangerous state of the pavement in some parts of
     London, it might be supposed that the Public paid nothing towards
     it. The thoroughfare about the New Church, in the Strand, is so
     bad, that two, or three, accidents have lately happened by horses
     tumbling down, from their feet catching in the holes."--(_Times,
     Sept. 30, 1799._)




GAMING, &c.


We, in this Nineteenth Century of ours, are not so free from the vice
of gambling, that we can afford the luxury of being particularly
censorious over the habits of the last century. We have legislated
against gambling, we are better educated, all our surroundings are
refined, compared to those which our forefathers had to make the most
of. Literature, Art, and Music, are all far more popular, and yet--are
there not Clubs, thinly veiled indeed, but really, and truly, solely
existing for card playing for high stakes, as much as Crockford's ever
was? Have we not reduced the Turf to a science? and has it not come to
such a pass, that an honest Nobleman like Lord Falmouth, will no
longer run his race horses, because of the roguery on the Turf? Is not
the Stock Exchange one huge Gamble? Therefore, in reading the notes
about gaming, in "Old Times," let us remember the beams in our own
eyes, before making a fuss about the motes, that used to be in the
eyes of those that are dead and gone.

But, although Card playing was the rule at every house, in the
evening, yet some did not play, and the utter weariness which is
shewn in this little sketch of Gillray's, is extremely natural and
vivid.

It is in 1789 that we first hear of Lady Archer, who, with Lady
Buckinghamshire, figures so prominently in keeping gaming tables.

[Illustration: A lady at a Card Party who does not play.--1788.]

     "The Lady Archer, whose death was announced in this paper of
     Saturday, is not the celebrated character whose _cosmetic powers_
     have been long held in public estimation."--(_Morning Post, Jan.
     5, 1789._)

       *       *       *       *       *

     "It is said that the dealers in _Carmine and dead white_, as well
     as the _Perfumers_ in general, have it in contemplation to
     present an address to Lady Archer, in gratitude for her not
     having DIED according to a late alarming report."--(_Morning
     Post, Jan. 8, 1789._)

"A Kick up at a Hazard Table," by Rowlandson, is not only well
drawn--but, doubtless, depicts a gambling affray, to the life.

Lady Archer, and Lady Buckinghamshire did not monopolise the gaming
tables, there were other ladies in the field, and, as the game
generally played, was _Faro_, these _brelandieres_ were called _Faro's
Daughters_.

     "Mrs. Sturt's house, in St. James Square, was opened yesterday
     evening, for the first time this season, for public play. The
     visitors were numerous."--(_Times, Feb. 5, 1793._)

       *       *       *       *       *

     "Many of our young sprigs of fashion, when the campaign opens,
     will have other game to attend to than the game of Faro. By
     risquing their persons they may serve their country; but by
     risquing their property, they can neither benefit the nation, nor
     do any good to themselves. Cocking a fire lock will redound more
     to their honour than cocking a card: and as they are fond of a
     game of _Hazard_, let them take the _chance_ of the field, in
     preference to that of the gaming table:

     "Some of the _Faro Ladies_ have opened their play houses, and
     announced the _Road to Ruin_ until further notice. The
     _Gamesters_ was publicly rehearsed in St. James Square on Monday
     night."--(_Times, Feb. 6, 1793._)

       *       *       *       *       *

     "The number of new gaming-houses, established at the West End of
     the town, is, indeed, a matter of very serious evil: but they are
     not likely to decrease while examples of the same nature are held
     forth in the higher circles of life. It is needless to point out
     any one of these houses in particular: it is sufficient for us to
     expose the tricks that are practised at many of them to swindle
     the unsuspecting young men of fortune who are entrapped into
     these whirlpools of destruction. The first thing necessary is, to
     give the guests a good dinner and plenty of wine, which many of
     these houses do, gratis. When they are sufficiently intoxicated,
     and, having lost all the money about them, their acceptance is
     obtained to Bills of Exchange to a considerable amount, which
     frequently are paid to avoid the disagreeable circumstance of a
     public exposition in a Court of Justice, which is always
     threatened, though the gamesters well know that no such measure
     durst be adopted by them.

     "Should any reluctance, or hesitation, be shewn by the injured
     party, to accept these bills, he is shewn into a long room, with
     a target at the end of it, and several pistols lying about, where
     he is given to understand these sharpers practice a considerable
     time of the day in shooting at a mark, and have arrived to such
     perfection in this exercise, that either of them can shoot a
     pistol ball within an inch of the mark, from the common distance
     taken by duellists. A hint is then dropped, that further
     hesitation will render the use of the pistols necessary, and
     which will again be the case, should he ever divulge what he has
     seen, and heard.

     "If further particulars, or proofs, are wanting, they may be
     known on application to certain _Military characters_, who have
     already made some noise in the world."--(_Times, Feb. 14, 1793._)

The Illustration "Modern Hospitality, or a Friendly Party in High
Life," is by Gillray, 31st Mar. 1792, and in it we see Lady Archer,
and Lady Buckinghamshire, keeping a Faro Bank: and, as they are rather
_passées_, the picture has the following, "To those earthly Divinities
who charmed 20 years ago, this Honorable method of banishing
mortifying reflections is dedicated. O, Woman! Woman! everlasting is
your power over us, for in youth, you charm away our hearts, and in
your after years you charm away our purses!"

[Illustration: Gambling--1792.]

It is a pity we have not the key to the portraits of the bystanders,
for portraits they, undoubtedly, are, because there is such
individuality in the expression of their several countenances. The
players we can easily recognise--Lady Archer, at the extreme left, has
won largely, rouleaux of gold, and bank notes, are before her, and on
her right hand are two heaps of loose gold;--with what a smiling
countenance does the painted old gambler shew her cards, saying, "The
Knave wins all!"

Her next door neighbour, the Prince of Wales, who has staked, and
lost, his last piece, lifts his hands, and eyes, in astonishment at
the luck. Lady Buckinghamshire has doubled her stake, playing on two
cards, and is evidently annoyed at her loss--whilst poor, black
muzzled Fox, laments the loss of his last three pieces.

     "The profits of Faro are become so considerably reduced, that
     most of the Banks now lose almost every evening, after defraying
     the expences of the house, which are very considerable. Those
     _public-spirited_ Ladies who give such frequent routes, do so at
     a certain gain: for the sum of TWENTY-FIVE guineas is regularly
     advanced by the bank holders towards the night's expences. The
     _punters_ at Mrs. Hobart's, and Mrs. Sturt's, Faro Banks have
     dropped off considerably: and those who continue, are got so
     _knowing_, that heavy complaints are made that they bring no
     grist to the mill. There have not been above eight punters at
     Mrs. Sturt's bank, any night this season. The _pigeons_ are all
     flown, and the _punters_ are nothing better than
     _hawks_."--(_Times, Feb. 10, 1793._)

       *       *       *       *       *

     "No less than six _Faro Banks_ are held in Pall Mall, viz.,
     Philips's, Nelson's, Curtis's, Hall's, Whitnoll's, and
     Bullock's."--(_Times, Feb. 18, 1793._)

       *       *       *       *       *

     "It is become necessary to put our young men on their guard
     against the swindling tricks of some French ladies in this
     metropolis, of elevated rank, who have introduced assemblies in
     their lodgings, and houses, of an evening, for the purpose of
     attracting company, whose pockets are to be taxed by Gallic
     address, for the support of these nocturnal establishments.

     "In one of these, the _Lady_ who presides, has not yet lost her
     personal charms, nor those arts of seduction, and that address,
     for which her _well-informed_ countrymen are so _notorious_. She,
     however, outwitted herself some day since, by employing one of
     her mitred attendants to dispose of a watch set with diamonds.
     This right reverend Father in God turned pedlar, in his extreme
     zeal to execute the orders of his fair hostess, offered the
     bauble to a gentleman who, the evening before, had been present
     at this _splendid_ assemblage of Gallic Noblesse, and had seen
     the watch by the side of the lady herself. On finding that double
     the value was demanded for the trinket, he was at no loss to
     discover the _ways and means_ by which this gaudy display of
     independence, comfort, and hilarity, was supported."--(_Times,
     Feb. 27, 1793._)

       *       *       *       *       *

     "The Banking _Ladies_ in St. James Square, do not see themselves
     much obliged to the _Abbé de St. Farre_, and his brother, for
     introducing so many noble Emigrants to their houses. These
     people come with their crown pieces and half-guineas, and
     absolutely form a circle round the Faro tables, to the total
     exclusion of our English Lords and Ladies, who can scarcely get
     one _punt_ during a whole evening."--(_Times, March 14, 1793._)

       *       *       *       *       *

     "The play at the _Faro Banks_ is reduced to so low a standard,
     except where they _punt_ on _tick_, that a _rouleau_ of 20
     guineas is quite a novelty."--(_Times, March 19, 1793._)

     "A principal Faro Bank was broken twice last week--on Monday

     the first night it lost 2000, and, on the last, 600 guineas. Lord
     C. S******* is one of the keenest _punters_ of the present day.
     Poor _Mazzinghi_, who deals the cards at Mrs. Sturt's Bank, was
     threatened on Tuesday night, by his Lordship, to have his bones
     broken, because he disputed the noble Lord's _intention of
     cocking a card_. The money was not deposited on the card in the
     regular manner, but the young Lord said he _intended_ to stake on
     the winning card, and therefore claimed it as if he had actually
     done so. Something was muttered about the _highway_, but it was
     impossible it could allude to the circumstance in
     question."--(_Times, April 29, 1793._)

     "Mrs. G. is said to understand Faro better than any other Lady of
     the town, particularly in the art of _doubling_ the corner of a
     card, so as to win triple stakes if it is successful. She has
     _doubled_ the Faro Bank holders out of so much money, that they
     shrink at the sight of her presence. There is so much running
     upon _tick_ with the Faro Tables, that, like the Country Banks,
     they are breaking every day. They will soon want some other
     assistance than Cards, and Wax Lights, to keep up some of the
     Establishments at the West end of the town.

     "The Faro Bank holders now lose money almost every evening. The
     _punters_ are now becoming the _rooks_, and the _bankers_ the
     _pigeons_. The Ladies understand the game so well, and play so
     _keen_, that it requires the eyes of _Argus_ to detect all their
     _tricks_. As little _Quick_ says in the play, a greenhorn has
     only to put down his money, and he is sure to find some one _to
     take it up for him_."--(_Times, May 1, 1793._)

     prosecution, because it is said, that there was much _filching_
     at her Faro table. The house was quite in an uproar on Tuesday
     night, in consequence of a paragraph that appeared in a Morning
     Paper of the preceding day. The Lady _vows_ she will call in the
     aid of an _Attorney_ to _support her reputation_: and observes,
     that the _credit_ of her house will suffer if such reports are
     permitted to go unpunished. The _Faro Ladies_ are, in the
     sporting phrase, almost _done up_. Jewels, trinkets, watches,
     laces, &c., are often at the pawnbrokers, and scarce anything is
     left to raise money upon, except their _pads_. If justice is to
     be _hoodwinked_, and _gambling_, and _sharking_, permitted, why
     not make it an article of revenue, as in foreign countries, and
     lay a heavy tax on it. A tax on excessive gaming would, in the
     course of a year, produce as much as would fit out a 50 gun

     talk of knocking down the _Croupiers_ if any offence is taken at
     the most barefaced frauds. Surely the Police may now make

     "To the CONDUCTOR of the TIMES.

     "Sir,--London is certainly an eligible place for persons who have
     nothing but their labour to depend on, to get forward in life,
     provided they steer clear of the many snares, and temptations,
     which hover in every alley, street, winding, and corner.

     "The mischief is, however, that the generality of young men, the
     moment they set foot in town, or, if brought up in the
     Metropolis, directly they enter the world on their own account,
     are hurried away, thoughtlessly, with the stream of error, and
     dissipation. If he happens to be a young man possessed of a
     moderate independence, without the suggestion of prudence, the
     caution of experience, the councils of wisdom or the restraint of
     authority, his whole conduct is then influenced by the passion
     with which he is actuated, which becomes at once, whether good or
     bad, his impulse, and his guide.

     "The Play-house is the first place of resort, which from the
     frequency of his visits, instead of being an instructive
     amusement, or a moral lesson, turns out a rendezvous of intrigue,
     and intemperance, where he soon acquires an intimacy with the
     idle, the profligate, the gambler, and the prostitute, who eye
     him as their lawful prey, and with all that ease, dexterity, and
     artifice, which a knowledge of the town, and its vicissitudes,
     has furnished them with, they imperceptibly lead him from one
     crime to another, till at length he becomes extravagant, and
     irregular, callous, and abandoned. Bagnios, gaming-tables,
     horses, and black-legs, are now his only wish, theme, and
     delight, and, so long as his pocket will endure the burden, so
     long, and no longer, is he duped, flattered, caressed, and
     encouraged, by those who surround him. But everything must have
     an end, and enormous expenditures cannot keep pace with that
     income which should be managed with care and frugality. The young
     Gentleman _runs short_, as it is termed, and, on his first
     embarrassment, is advised to apply for the assistance of some
     _friendly advertising money lender_, who, upon proper security,
     has the _modesty_ to procure him from time to time, sums of
     money, at the _equitable premium of 100 per cent_. A repetition
     so involves him, that, by degrees, his estate falls into the
     hands of Mr. Usurer, who takes an _absolute assignment of his
     estate_, for a consideration less than half its true value: and
     reflection never once enters his head, but he unfortunately
     squanders the last shilling: but it is, now, he conceives, a
     folly to repent, or retreat: consequently he gets into debt, is
     arrested, carried to a spunging house, and from thence is removed
     to the King's Bench, or Fleet Prison.

     "Far be it from me to throw any odium on an unfortunate class of
     people immured in the walls of either of those places, there are
     no doubt, imprisoned, as worthy, and as good a set of people, as
     any in society. But the young spark I am speaking of, being
     mortified at his late companions standing aloof, and resigning
     him to his fate, becomes loaded with obloquy, associates with
     characters equally as vicious as himself, smoaks, swears, and
     carouses, and, all at once, is wholly lost, as it were to
     himself, and to the world.

     his house, he should not lay an impost upon him, even more
     exorbitant than that which he would pay, were he to attend a

These two illustrations are almost Hogarthian in their contrast, and
preach a homily, better than pages of text would do, on the similarity
of plunder. St. James, with Lady Archer and Lady Buckinghamshire
quarrelling over gold, bank notes, a sword, and an Order. One other
lady, probably Lady Mount Edgcumbe, scrutinising a bill--whilst the
fourth, with a pile of gold, and notes, before her, looks calmly on.
The artist (who, unfortunately, is anonymous,) shows what very little
difference there is between that, and the woman of St. Giles--who, to
the accompaniment of Gin, are dividing _their_ spoil, a pipe, a foot
rule, a razor, &c.--little things reft from working men--on a very
common deal table.

It was about this time that special attention was called to this
gaming mania, and Gillray (?) on the 16th May, 1796, published a
Caricature called "Faro's Daughters, or the Kenyonian blow up to
gamblers." Here we see the Lady Archer, and Mrs. Concannon, placed
together in the pillory, and mutually upbraiding each other.

The _motif_ for this picture was a speech of Lord Kenyon's, who, at a
trial to recover £15, won at gaming, on Sunday, at a public
house--commented very severely on the hold, the vice of gaming had, on
all classes of society, from the highest, to the lowest. The former,
he said, set the example to the latter--and, he added, "They think
they are too great for the law; I wish they could be punished,"--and
then continued, "If any prosecutions of this kind are fairly brought
before me, and the parties are justly convicted, whatever be their
rank, or station, in the country--though they be the first ladies in
the land--they shall certainly exhibit themselves in the pillory."

     "A new stratagem has been hit on to gain early intelligence of
     the drawings of the ensuing Irish Lottery. As _Pigeons_ are found
     sometimes not to fly quick enough, some of our speculating
     Lottery Rooks have been for some time past trying experiments on
     high eminences in North Wales, by exhibiting rockets about seven
     o'clock in the evening. It is to be seen whether this mode of
     communication can be rendered sufficiently intelligible, to
     answer the purposes of fraud."--(_Times, Nov. 4, 1796._)

     Episcopal Lords, means to introduce a Bill into Parliament to
     prevent _gambling on a Sunday_. An act at present does exist
     against this pernicious practice; but the penalty amounts to a
     fine, that the Groom-porters at Hazard, or the Dealer at Faro,
     can with ease pay by the _profits of an hour_. The punishment for
     the offence of playing any game of chance on a Sunday is, by this
     new intended Bill, to be _transportation for seven years to
     Botany Bay_. The owner of the house, by a particular clause, is
     more severely dealt with. _He_, or _she_, permitting such
     gambling, shall be transported for life."--(_Times, Feb. 13,

     "PUBLIC OFFICE, MARLBOROUGH St. FARO BANKS. On Saturday came on
     to be heard, informations against Lady Buckinghamshire, Lady
     Elizabeth Luttrell, Mrs. Sturt, and Mr. Concannon, for having,
     on the night of the 30th of last January, played at _Faro_, at
     Lady Buckinghamshire's house, in St. James's Square, and Mr.
     Martindale was charged with being the proprietor of the table.

     parties at their different houses by rotation, and that when they
     met at Lady B.'s, the witnesses used to wait upon them in the
     gambling room, and that they played at _E.O._, _Rouge et Noir_,
     &c., from about eleven, or twelve, till three, or four, o'clock
     in the morning. After hearing Counsel, the Magistrates convicted
     _Hy. Martindale_ in the penalty of £200, and _each of the Ladies_
     in £50. The Information against Mr. _Concannon_ was quashed, on

The Magistrates were not quite so severe as Lord Kenyon had promised
to be, should he ever get any of these ladies into his clutches:
perhaps they had heard of the recent loss of Lady Buckinghamshire's,
when in Feb{y}. her Faro Bank was stolen, or, at least, _she said it
had been_. Gillray caricatured it very cleverly--as also he did in the
accompanying illustration, "Discipline à la Kenyon"--in which the Lord
Chief Justice, is administering a sound flogging to Lady
Buckinghamshire, whilst Lady Archer, and Mrs. Concannon, stand in the
pillory, guarded by a stalwart constable.

     E. O.[5] is now in high practice, but more particularly so in the
     neighbourhood of S. James's Street, Pall Mall, and what is called
     the fashionable end of the town. The Tables, even if they were
     fairly constructed, must be the ruin of all adventurers; because,
     in the course of one hour, they play at a game where the Table
     has clearly _one hundred and twenty-four_ chances to _one_ in its
     favor within that hour. If this does not rouse the Magistracy,
     Justice may then be announced to be in a somniferous
     state--occasioned probably, by a yellow mineral
     application."--(_Times, June 22, 1795._)

          the ball down towards the cavities prepared for its

     "PRIVATE LOTTERIES.

     "Amongst the various species of Gaming that have ever been
     practised, we think none exceeds the mischiefs, and calamities,
     that arise from the practice of private Lotteries, which at
     present are carrying on, in various parts of the town, to very
     alarming extents, much to the discredit of those whose province
     it is to suppress such nefarious practices, as they cannot be
     ignorant of such transactions. 'The little go,' which is the
     technical term for a private Lottery, is calculated only for the
     meridian of those understandings, who are unused to calculate,
     and discriminate, between right, and wrong, and roguery, and
     fair-dealing; and, in this particular case, it is those who
     compose the lower order of society, whom it so seriously affects,
     and on whom it is chiefly designed to operate. No man of common
     sense can suppose that the Lottery Wheels are fair, and honest,
     or that the proprietors act upon principles anything like honor,
     or honesty; for, by the art, and contrivance, of the Wheels, they
     are so constructed, with secret springs, and the application of
     gum, glue, &c., in the internal part of them, that they can draw
     the numbers out, or keep them in, at pleasure, just as it suits
     their purposes; so that the insurer, robbed, and cajoled, by such
     unfair means, has not the most distant chance of ever winning:
     the whole being a gross fraud, and imposition, in the extreme. We
     understand the most notorious of these standards of imposition
     are situated in Carnaby Market, Oxford Road, in the Borough,
     Islington, Clerkenwell, and various other places, most of which
     are under the very nose of Magistracy, in seeming security,
     bidding defiance to law, and preying upon the vitals of the poor
     and ignorant.

     "We hope the Magistrates of each jurisdiction, and those who
     possess the same power, will perform their duty on behalf of the
     poor, over whom they preside, and put a stop to such a growing,
     and alarming, evil, of such pernicious, and dangerous tendency:
     particularly, as the Proprietors are well-known bad characters,
     consisting of needy beggars, desperate swindlers, gamblers,
     sharpers, notorious thieves, and common convicted felons, most of
     whose names stand recorded in the Newgate Calendar for various
     offences of different descriptions."--(_Times, July 22, 1795._)

       *       *       *       *       *

     "The term of _little goes_ for the private lotteries is apt
     enough, for the poor devils who risk their property there, have
     but little, and that little goes to nought.

     "If the wheels of fortune, and the cash, seized at the private
     lotteries, become the property of the police runners, the old
     adage will be strongly verified, 'What is got over the devil's
     back, will be spent under his belly.'"--(_Times, Aug. 13,
     1795._)

       *       *       *       *       *

     "On Friday night last, in consequence of searching warrants from
     the Parochial Magistrates of St. James's, Westminster, upwards of
     30 persons were apprehended at the house of one M'Call, No. 2,
     Francis St., near Golden Square, and in the house of J. Knight,
     King St., where the most destructive practices _to the poor_ were
     carrying on, that of _Private Lotteries_ (called Little Goes.)
     Two wheels, with the tickets, were seized on the premises. Upon
     examination of those persons, who proved to be the poor deluded
     objects that had been there plundered, they were reprimanded, and
     discharged.

     "The wives of many industrious mechanics, by attending these
     nefarious houses, have not only been duped out of their earnings
     (which ought to have been applied to the providing bread for
     their families) but have even pawned their beds, wedding rings,
     and almost every article they were possessed of for that
     purpose."--(_Times, Aug. 11, 1795._)

[Illustration: Faro's Daughters.]

But nothing was said against the big State Lotteries--which were going
on without let, or hindrance--and, absolutely, educating the people in
the taste for gambling. Here are two anecdotes of the lottery:--

     "Dr. B., a physician at _Lime_ (Dorset), a few days since, being
     under pecuniary embarrassment, and his house surrounded by
     bailiffs, made his escape by a window, into a neighbour's house,
     from whence he fled to London. The furniture was seized, and the
     sale actually commenced, when it was stopped by a letter, stating
     that the Doctor, upon his arrival in London, found himself the
     proprietor of the £20,000 prize. We guarantee the truth of this
     fact."--(_Times, Dec. 27, 1797._)

       *       *       *       *       *

     "The £20,000 prize, drawn on Friday, is divided amongst a number
     of poor persons: a female servant in Brook St., Holborn, had a
     sixteenth; a woman who keeps a fruit-stall in Grays-Inn-lane
     another; a third is possessed by a servant of the Duke of
     Roxburghe's; a fourth by a Chelsea Carrier of vegetables to
     Covent Garden; one eighth belongs to a poor family in
     Rutlandshire, and the remainder is similarly divided."--(_Times,
     Mar. 19, 1798._)

Of Horse Racing we do not hear much--the prizes were small--and
gambling on the Turf was not reduced to a Science as it is now-a-days.
Even when attending races, the chief losses were at the gaming tables
which accompanied them.

     "Poor _Newmarket_ is completely done up! The Spring Meeting
     boasts so few bets in the calendar of gambling, that the chance
     will not pay post-chaise hire to the black legs. Thus falls the
     destructive sport of the Turf--and, as that is the case, it would
     do honour to his Majesty to change the _King's Plates_ into
     rewards for the _improvement of Agriculture_."--(_Times, April
     17, 1794._)

     "The Duke of Queensberry was a principal loser at Epsom Races.
     The Noble Duke had his _vis-a-vis_, and six horses, driving about
     the course, with two very pretty _emigrées_ in it. The Duke was
     in his cabriolet. The Duke of Bedford, Lords Egremont, and Derby,
     were also on the course. Several carriages were broken to pieces:
     and one Lady had her arm broken.

     "There was much private business done in the _swindling way_ at
     the last Epsom races. One black legged fellow cleared near a
     thousand pounds by the old trick of an E.O. Table. Another had a
     _faro table_, and was on the eve of _doing business_, when he was
     detected with a _palmed_ card: almost the whole of what may be
     justly styled 'vagabond gamblers' of London were present.

     "Mr. Bowes, half brother to the Earl of Strathmore, was robbed
     of a gold watch, and a purse, containing 30 guineas, at Epsom
     races, on Thursday last. Many other persons shared a similar
     fate, both on the same evening, and Friday. Upwards of 30
     carriages were robbed coming from the races."--(_Times, May 25,
     1795._)

       *       *       *       *       *

     "Never since _racing_ was patronised by the _Merry Monarch_, has
     the _Turf_ been so much on the decline as at this period. His
     Grace of Bedford is the only person who retains a considerable
     stud. Lord Grosvenor has disposed of nearly the whole of his,
     with the reserve of two, or three, capital horses, and some few
     brood mares."--(_Times, Sept. 8, 1797._)

       *       *       *       *       *

     "A _Mr. Marston_, of the Borough, has laid a bet of 2000 guineas,
     that he will, in the course of the ensuing week, go into one of
     the great wheels of the water-works at London Bridge, while it is
     in its swiftest motion with an ebb-tide, stay there five minutes,
     and come out again with safety, though not without accident, in a
     different part from that in which he went in: and afterwards walk
     one mile within an hour, on condition that the lower bucket of
     the wheel is two feet distance from the river bottom."--(_Times,
     Sept. 11, 1797._)

[Illustration: Discipline à la Kenyon.--1797.]

These water-wheels which were situated where Fishmongers Hall now
stands, were commenced in 1582, by a Dutchman, named Peter Moritz, or
Morrice, with one wheel. _Hatton_, in his "New View of London,"
published in Queen Anne's time, says, "besides the old work erected by
Mr. _Morris_, the New, placed in the 4th Arch of the Bridge, consists
of 2 Wheels with 7 Engines, set up about the year 1702, so that there
are in all 13 engines. They are the contrivance of that great English
Engineer Mr. _Sorocold_, whereby the _Thames_ Water is raised from the
N. end of the Bridge, to a very great altitude, by which means, many
parts of the City, &c., are served with the Thames Water."




THE THEATRE.


Our forefathers were fond of the Theatre, and patronised it nightly.
They were exacting as to the quality of the acting represented before
them, and that very _exigeance_ procured them what they wanted.

In the years of which I treat, there were, in London, the following
Theatres:--The King's (now Her Majesty's) in the Haymarket--Drury
Lane--Covent Garden--The Theatre Royal, Haymarket--Royalty Theatre,
Wells Street, Goodman's Fields--Royal Circus, St. George's
Fields--Sadler's Wells--The Royal Grove, and Amphitheatre (Astley's)
Westminster Bridge--afterwards Astley's Royal Saloon--and still later
called, Astley's Amphitheatre of Arts. Whilst at the Lyceum in the
Strand, there were Musical Entertainments, and a New Circus.

It was an age of good actors, and, taking them haphazard, we have only
to glance at the following names, to prove the assertion, were it
needed. _Suett_, who drank himself to death in 1805. _John Kemble_,
the best tragic actor since Garrick. From an education for the
priesthood, to performing with a strolling company, was a great
leap--but his success was assured when, in 1783, he made his début, at
Drury Lane, as Hamlet. He retired from the stage in 1817, and died in
1823. _Baddeley_ was not a first rate actor, and I but mention him
because of his bequest of Cake, and Wine, to be partaken of, annually,
by the Company, in the Green room of Drury Lane, every Twelfth night.
_Quick_ was irresistibly comic--and none could see him act without
laughing. He lived to a good old age (acting up to 1813), above
83--dying in the year 1831.

_Edmund Kean_ was born in 1787, and went on the stage as soon as he
could walk.--After his education at Eton, he went on the provincial
boards--not playing in London, until 1814, when he played Shylock, at
Drury Lane. Died 1833. _Macklin_, "the Jew, that Shakespeare drew,"
acted until he was 90--appearing, for the last time, on the occasion
of his benefit, May 7, 1789. After he was dressed for Shylock, he went
into the Green Room, and, seeing Mrs. Pope there, said "My dear, are
you to play to-night?" "To be sure I am, Sir," she replied, "do you
not see I am dressed for Portia?"--"Ah! very true; I had
forgotten--but who is to play Shylock!" They got his poor old feeble
mind, at last, to grasp the situation, and he went on the stage--but,
after two, or three, speeches, he was obliged to give it up, and had
to ask the indulgence of the audience, and beg of them to accept Mr.
Ryder, as his substitute. He lived some years afterwards, till 11th
July 1797--when he died, at the age of 98.

_Bannister_ began his theatrical career at the early age of 12. At
his engagement at Drury Lane, in 1779, he played tragedy, but, after
the death of Edwin, he supplied his place, and played Comedy. He died
8th Nov. 1836, aged 76. _Incledon_ was the sweetest singer of his
time, and made his debut at Covent Garden in 1790--Died 1826.
_Elliston_ first appeared in London, at the Haymarket in 1796.
Although he was not a famous actor, he cannot be omitted from a list
of theatrical celebrities. Then, too, among the lesser stars, were
_Barrymore_, _Ryder_, _Johnstone_, _Pope_, _Holman_ and _Munden_--not
even forgetting _Delpini_ the famous Clown, and Scaramouch.

[Illustration: The Theatre.]

Among the chief actresses, was _Mrs. Jordan_, whose real name was
Dorothy Bland, who became a decided favourite, with a London audience,
at her first appearance at Drury Lane, in 1785. Her connection with
the Duke of Clarence, afterwards William 4th, is well known. They
lived very happily together, and had ten Children, but the connection
was broken off in 1811--and she was left to shift for herself. She
died in 1816.

The name of _Sarah Siddons_ is too well known to elicit any remark; as
a tragedian, her equal has, probably, never been seen on an English
Stage. She had a long career--from her _début_, at Drury Lane, in
1775, till her last appearance, in London, in 1816. Died 1831--aged
76.

_Miss Farren_, was a most lady-like, and elegant actress. She was tall
and slim, and was caricatured as being positively scraggy--but she
captivated the then Lord Derby, who, in physique was her complete
antithesis, having short legs, a very corpulent body, and a
hydrocephalous head. She retired from the stage before her marriage,
in 1796.

_Mrs. Crouch_, and _Mrs. Billington_, the rival songstresses, were
actresses, but they generally had parts assigned them, in which they
could exercise their vocal powers, and they sang at Oratorios, and
Concerts. Mrs. Billington did not retire from her profession until
1800. She died in 1817.

_Mrs. Frances Abington_ first appeared before a London audience on
21st Aug. 1755, and played, with few intermissions, until 1798. After
Mrs. Clive, she was the best comic actress on the English stage, and
could equally play Lady Teazle, Lady Betty Modish, a Chambermaid, a
Romp, or a Country girl--Died, 1815.

_Mrs. Bellamy_, can just claim a notice, because she died in 1788, but
she left the stage in 1785. She was a tragic actress, and was reckoned
equal to _Mrs. Cibber_.

Chief among the next rank of actresses, we must place _Miss Brunton_,
_Mrs. Martyr_, and _Mrs. Pope_.

Thinking it would interest my readers, I have taken some portraits of
the chief Actors, and Actresses, of the time, from a very rare book,
and they are interesting to the present generation, as shewing the
Costumes in which the plays were acted, and, which, I suppose,
satisfied the æsthetic, and archæological, taste of our grandfathers.

Both audience, and press, were very outspoken in their criticisms,
and, indeed, in those days, dramatic criticism was real, and had not
been reduced to a fine art, as now. Take the following instance:--

     "Theatre, Covent Garden. Hoadley's agreeable Comedy of _The
     Suspicious Husband_, was, last night, in general, presented here
     with spirit, and attended by a considerable audience. The
     Character of most prominent merit, as to performance, was
     _Strickland_, which Farren supported with strong emotion, and
     probable impression. Mrs. Abington would have represented
     _Clarinda_ with more effect, if she had not directed all her
     share of the dialogue entirely to the audience. Pope was the
     _Frankly_, but he must take great pains before he will acquire
     the ease necessary for genteel Comedy. Lewis's _Ranger_ was not
     sufficiently marked by the appearance of that airy dissipation
     which the part demands. Mrs. Wells' _Jacintha_ was only
     distinguished for rustic dialect, and awkward deportment. Mrs.
     Bernard had the merit of being decent in _Mrs.
     Strickland_."--(_The Morning Post, Jan. 3, 1788._)

The Theatre, was, then, as now, a passion with some people, and
amateur theatricals were in high favour.

[Illustration: Mr. Macklin, as Shylock. Mr. Holman, as Richard.]

     "At the Blenheim Theatre, her Grace the Duchess of Marlborough
     attended her guests in person, and superintended the refreshments
     of Sandwiches, fruit and wines, which were distributed in
     profusion."--(_Morning Post, Mar. 28, 1788._)

The Newspapers gave Theatrical Gossip--as the following, all from the
_Morning Post, Jan. 15, 1789_, shews:--

     "It has lately been a practice with one, or two, of the female
     performers at Drury Lane Theatre, to refuse appearing on the
     stage, though much after the time of commencing the play, because
     the boxes may not happen to be filled with fashionable visitors,
     regardless of any disapprobation which may arise from the
     impatience of the audience.

     "When the New Theatre is erected for the Managers of Old Drury,
     it is in contemplation to fix a Clock over the Stage, where the
     inscription is now placed, that, if the performance should be
     improperly delayed, and the audience become clamorous, the Public
     may be informed to whom the blame should be applied."

     "A whimsical incident happened the other night, at the reading of
     Cumberland's new Comedy. The Author, who read the piece himself,
     began with the _Dramatis Personæ_, thus, 'The _Impostor_, by Mr.
     Palmer:' A laugh occurring at this, the Author became embarrassed
     on seeing Mr. Palmer in the room, but, recovering himself, he
     added, 'being his _first appearance_ in that character.'"

       *       *       *       *       *

     "Mrs. Jordan and Kemble, according to Green Room report, are not
     upon the most amicable footing. It is supposed that the lady
     takes advantages of her popularity _to be ill when she pleases_,
     and has refused to perform in a farce when Mrs. Siddons appears
     in the play, and for this _modest_ reason, 'that _she_ will not
     fill the house, and let Mrs. Siddons run away with the reputation
     of it.'"--(_Morning Post, Mar. 10, 1789._)

We come across a curious glimpse of Mrs. Robinson--the "Perdita,"
(deserted by her "Florizel,") in the _Morning Post, March 11, 1789_.

     "Perdita, the once beautiful Perdita, parades, every day, along
     Pall Mall, in her carriage, from which she frequently

      'Casts a longing ling'ring look,'

     in hopes that her charms, which, formerly, commanded the grave
     and the gay, may revive an attachment long since extinguished.
     This unhappy beauty had better try Hyde Park, if she must have a
     little morning air--such a daily excursion would be more
     serviceable to her health, than an anxious ride through Pall
     Mall, can be gratifying to her pride."

Theatrical Salaries were not very high--for, _teste_, the _Morning
Post, of March 13, 1789_:--

     "It is said that Mrs. Jordan has but Six Pounds a week. Who will
     venture to say, that, considering the present attraction of her
     talent, this is an adequate recompense?"

The _Morning Post, Oct. 27, 1798_, has the following two paragraphs as
to behaviour at the theatres:--

     "Two men in the pit at Drury Lane Theatre, last night, were so
     turbulent, and riotous, during the last act of Henry the Fifth,
     that the performance was interrupted upwards of a quarter of an
     hour. The audience, at last, asserted their power, and turned
     them disgracefully out of the Theatre. This should always be done
     to crush the race of disgusting puppies that are a constant
     nuisance at the playhouse every night."

     "A box lobby puppy having insulted a gentleman at Covent Garden
     Theatre, on Friday night, received a very suitable drubbing.
     When this necessary chastisement was completed, the _beater_
     demanded _satisfaction_. 'Have I not thrashed you to your heart's
     content?' said the gentleman. The other replied, with great
     simplicity, 'Sir, that is no _satisfaction_ to me.'"

[Illustration: Mr. Pope, as Hotspur.]

[Illustration: Mr. Johnstone as Apollo.]

Fancy our modern Royal Family, on their visits to the
Theatre--_joining heartily in the choruses_, and witnessing _slang
dances_: yet so it was in 1793.

     "The very pleasant Comedy of _Notoriety_ was, yesterday evening,
     performed before _their Majesties_, the three elder Princesses,
     and a very brilliant house. Some well-timed songs introduced into
     the pantomime of _Harlequin's Museum_, gave the audience an
     opportunity of testifying their loyalty to the King, and
     attachment to both her Majesty, and her family, who joined
     heartily in the choruses. We never saw them better entertained.
     But surely the Slang dance which is introduced might be very
     properly omitted:--it is too vulgar for so elegant, and well
     conducted, a theatre."--(_Times, Feb. 5, 1793._)

       *       *       *       *       *

     "The _private boxes_ at the Haymarket Theatre are so _thinly
     partitioned_, that we are surprised any person should deem them
     proper places to recapitulate _domestic bickerings_."--(_Times,
     Feb. 6, 1793._)

The following is _apropos_ of Mrs. Jordan:--

     "Performers at the Theatres are now paid more liberally than
     heretofore. We are sorry when their public conduct gives reason
     for complaint. As the frequenters of them are their support, it
     will ever be necessary, in the public, to bring them to a proper
     sense of their situation. It is only by this means the conductors
     of our entertainments can have any sway over them."--(_Times,
     Mar. 10, 1793._)

       *       *       *       *       *

     "Brandenburgh House Theatricals.

     "The opening of the New Theatre, belonging to the Margrave of
     Anspach's Villa, at Hammersmith, took place on Thursday evening,
     with an entertainment the most costly, and at the same time, the
     most tasty, and elegant, we ever remember to have witnessed. The
     Prince of Wales, who was present, declared he had never seen
     anything more splendid, and handsomely conducted. The Theatre is
     built at a short distance from the house, between which there is
     a communication by means of a colonnade. The outside appearance
     rather resembles an old Gothic building, than a Temple devoted to
     the Muses. The inside is prettily fitted up, but the ceiling is
     too low for the size of it.

     "The performance opened by a prelude: after which a little piece
     was represented, entitled Fanfan and Colas, the characters by the
     Margravine, young Keppel Craven, Mons. and Medame Texier, and
     Count d'Alet, _Lord High Chamberlain of the Household_. The third
     _petite piece_ was a very humorous dialogue called Le Poulet,
     between Mrs. Hobart, as an English servant maid, and Mons. Le
     Texier, as a French Valet. Both were inquisitive after news: the
     one told all the _chit chat_ of the town in her English dialect:
     the other told the great exploits going forward in France, in
     French. Mrs. Hobart played her part to admiration, and very aptly
     introduced, among other things, the story of her own public
     _Fete_, last summer, at Ham, where the torrents of rain poured
     down, in such abundance, as to turn all her fine creams into poor
     milk and water.

     "The supper, after the play, was magnificent in the extreme, and
     consisted of a profusion of all the delicacies of the season.
     Besides Soups, and every dainty meat, there were pine apples, new
     grapes, cherries, strawberries, &c.

     "After the supper, there was a Masquerade, and Ball, which was
     quite unexpected to the Company. The Margravine had provided new
     dresses for all the company, and the Ladies, and Gentlemen, each
     dressed in separate rooms. The Duke of Clarence changed his dress
     seven different times, and greatly added to the hilarity of the
     entertainment. The Prince was in a domino."--(_Times, April 27,

     "It having been observed, in some public prints, that the Hon.
     Mrs. Twisleton was the first female of fashion who had made the
     stage her profession, it is but justice to notice, that Mrs.
     Holman (the _ci-devant_ Mrs. Hughes) who made her debut in
     Dublin, some years since, has a priority to public notice on this
     account: if real rank by _birth_, education, and fortune, give a
     title to distinction, if admission to the first orders of
     fashionable society have pretensions, the friends of that Lady
     have certainly a right to enter her claims on this
     subject."--(_Times, Feb. 13, 1794._)

     OPENING OF NEW DRURY.

     "Public curiosity, which has long been on the tip-toe of
     expectation, was yesterday gratified by the opening of this
     superb edifice, under the immediate management of Mr. Kemble,
     whose approved talents well entitle him to so flattering a mark
     of distinction. Of this Theatre, language must be inadequate to
     give even a faint idea of the effect it produces on the
     spectator, at his _entré_: nor does the first impression in the
     least diminish from a more minute examination into its structure,
     and decorations: the whole forming a happy combination of the
     gay, and the grand. The Stage, fitted as it was for an Oratorio,
     presented a nouvelle, and pleasing, prospect. The representation
     of a Gothic Cathedral, with the 'Long sounding Isle,' and

       'Storied windows richly dight
        Casting a dim religious light,'

     was admirably adapted to suit with the solemnity appertaining to
     sacred selections.

     "From the opening of the doors, to the first crash of the band,
     most able in all its movements, the satisfaction and delight of
     the audience was expressed by repeated, and increasing,
     plaudits--encouraged not a little by the care, and attention,
     evinced by the Proprietors, for the convenience of the public, in
     the approaches to the House--in every respect answering to the
     magnificence, and accommodation, within. Independent of the
     attraction, long, very long, to be expected from the novelty, as
     well as beauty, of the New Drury, some credit ought to be given
     to that which must ever have its weight with the people at large,
     as well as amateurs--a numerous, and well appointed, set of vocal
     performers. The names of Harrison, Storace, Kelly, Crouch, and
     Dignum, are too proverbial for excellence in their several lines,
     to need our eulogium. Miss Leake, whose unaffected correctness of
     style, and melody of tone, must shortly place her deservedly high
     in her profession, may also be deemed almost as powerful an
     acquisition as Miss Parke, at the other House. Mr. Meredith, from
     Liverpool, possesses a fine deep volume of voice, which he
     exerted to great advantage. This Gentleman, we recollect some
     years since at Ranelagh, _and_, if we are not very much mistaken,
     at the Little Theatre, as the Prodigal Son of Dr. Arnold's
     charming Oratorio.

     "Giornovici's Concerto would have gone off much better, had the
     subject not been so tedious. This is a fault we have too often
     cause to find with Concerto Performers, who frequently give us
     too much of a good thing. His mode of introduction was
     particularly awkward--some other might be contrived than pitching
     him upon a plank, brought in at the hazard of discomfiting the
     head dresses, or breaking the noses of the ladies in the
     Orchestra.

     "The sound was rather too redundant, in general, and the language
     of the Gods, now and then, too plainly heard in the pit; but, as
     it arises merely from the freshness of the building, this
     inconvenience will gradually be amended.

     "The Prince of Wales was with Mrs. Fitzherbert, and Mr. Sheridan,
     in the box appropriated to his Royal Highness. Lord Thurlow sat,
     apparently well pleased, in the box beneath. Mr. and Mrs. Kemble,
     Mrs. Siddons, and Sir Francis Bourgeois, saw that all was well,
     in one of the orchestra boxes.

     "From the frequent _encores_, the Selection was not over till a
     late hour. The usual cry of 'take care of your pockets' on
     quitting the Theatre, was superfluous: for _Townsend_ attended to
     keep a 'wary eye;' so the pickpockets, of course, found it
     impracticable to make any 'palpable hits.'"--(_Times, March 13,
     1794._)

     "Miss Farren has left London for Dublin where she is to perform
     12 nights. The terms of her engagement, are £500, and a clear
     benefit. It is not true that she takes _Derby_ in her
     route."--(_Times, June 26, 1794._)

       *       *       *       *       *

     "The high demands made by some Actresses on the Management of
     Theatres, are so exorbitant, that we trust they will not be
     complied with. Mrs. Jordan, and Storace, have demanded, the
     first, £30, and the latter, £20, a night. Much as we admire the
     abilities of each on the stage, yet we know, from experience,
     that the higher the salaries of some performers are, the more
     they are prone to disrespect the public, and to give themselves
     insufferable airs."--(_Times, Oct. 4, 1794._)

       *       *       *       *       *

     _Storace_ has come down to the terms of her last engagement, and
     they are adequate to her abilities. The ci-devant Princess of
     Petersham still holds out: but it is thought that _want_ of
     _ammunition_ will occasion her soon to capitulate. When the
     theatre was opened in Goodman's fields a first rate actress
     thought herself amply paid with _forty shillings_ per week: but,
     now, a first rate actress has the conscience to demand _forty
     pounds_ Per night."--(_Times, Oct. 9, 1794._)

     "The popular Dramatist, in his rage for hunting down the follies
     of the day, we hope will not forget to be _in_ at the _death_ of
     our masculine women of fashion. Their hunting, shooting, driving,
     cricketing, faroing, and skating, present a monstrous chaos of
     absurdity, not only making day, and night, hideous, but the sex
     itself equivocal. Lady men, or men ladies, 'you'll say 'tis
     Persian, but let it be changed.'"--(_Times, Oct. 18, 1794._)

     "Much has been said upon the Bath Fracas, but the circumstance
     has never yet been explained. It is briefly this: The Hon. Mrs.
     Twisleton was at the Ball-room, and stood up to dance: she
     stickled a little for _precedence_ as an _Honorable_: the Master
     of the Ceremonies began to object to her dancing at all, as a
     _Public Performer_. Her partner instanced a Performer, M.
     Yanievitz, who was in the constant habit of appearing there. The
     Master of the Ceremonies went up to this amiable, and
     distinguished, foreigner, and intimated that his appearance there
     was thought too frequent, by the Subscribers. Mr. Yanievitz,
     demanded who had given the Master of Ceremonies this intimation:
     a satisfaction which was refused. Next morning Mr. Yanievitz
     wrote a proper letter to the M. C. expressive of his sentiments
     upon this occasion.

     "A meeting of subscribers was called, and they resolved, that, in
     future, no Public Performer, of any description, should be
     permitted to appear in any of the Public rooms."--(_Times, March

     whose appearance might prove distressing to them."--(_Times,

     performers in both Theatres, on the Act against _profane cursing,
     and swearing_--it became a question, as the Act is a

     was decided that they should be treated according to the

     Drury Lane Theatre has not experienced a riot so wild, and
     unappeasable, as that of Tuesday evening, since the _Blackamoor
     Washed White_, of famous memory. The Entertainments advertised
     for the night's amusements were _three_. The _Smugglers_, having
     nothing contraband on board, was not only suffered to pass, but
     was hailed with three cheers:--The _Virgin Unmasked_ had her
     admirers--but the _Deserter_ was mauled most dreadfully--for
     Young Welsh had permitted a new _Skirmish_ to make his _debut_,
     as _Suett_ phrased it: and, being a miserable wretch, when the
     audience expressed a disapprobation, the Performers, to shorten
     the ridicule, shortened the scenes, which on such occasions, is
     usual, and prudent--but, the curtain dropping at ten minutes past
     ten, created a violent burst of indignation. Kelly first
     attempted to enquire the wishes of _John Bull_, and expressed
     himself, in the name of the Performers, ignorant of how he was
     disobliged. All striving to be heard, none, of course, could be
     so, and he retired. Uproar still increased, and, after near half
     an hour of this din, Suett made his appearance, and apologised
     for the badness of the stage struck hero, but he was soon given
     to understand, that that was not the cause of the _Row_, but that
     the audience expected to have the "Deserter" played _wholly_ over
     again. Mr. S., after "looking as queer as a quartern of soap
     after a week's wash," expressed his concern that many of the
     Performers were gone, and the stage lights out, but this was the
     cause of fresh howlings, and as somebody cried out, 'God save
     the King,' he promised to send as many of the Orchestra, as could
     be found. In five minutes this popular hymn was received with
     acclamation. The curtain drew up, and all the Performers in the
     Theatre sung it. The curtain again dropt amid violent tumults
     which continued, and increased. Again Mr. Suett appeared, and
     declared 'how much hurt the Proprietors were at any part of the
     Performance being omitted: that it was without their concurrence,
     or even knowledge, and that such a circumstance should never
     happen again.' This rather mollified the audience, and many
     dispersed at a quarter past 11. Almost the whole of the lights in
     the house had been long extinguished: and some of the benches
     were torn up."--(_Times, May 13, 1796._)

       *       *       *       *       *

     "On Thursday last a ludicrous _fracas_ took place in one of the
     boxes of the first circle, at Drury Lane Theatre. A gentleman,
     finding himself much incommoded by the heat, had recourse to his
     smelling-bottle. One of the fighting lobby loungers, who stood
     close to him, took offence at the scent, and desired him to put
     it up. The demand not being obeyed, an altercation ensued, which
     ended with the customary _etiquette_ of _Boabdil's_ presenting
     his card, and desiring his antagonist's, in return. The card was
     accepted, but the only notice taken of it, was a formal offer of
     the smelling-bottle. This retort completely disconcerted the
     would-be Duellist, who found himself so unexpectedly taken by the
     _nose_, and the affair concluded with a general laugh at the
     impertinence of the offender."--(_Times, Oct. 7, 1797._)

     "The indecent behaviour of the Box-lobby loungers, becomes, every
     day, more disorderly, and offensive. Two of this contemptible
     class, who frequent the Theatre, merely to interrupt the
     performance, and disturb the audience, quarrelled, on Tuesday
     night, at Drury-Lane house, and, regardless of every kind of
     decorum, stripped in the lobby, and decided their dispute _à la
     Mendoza_. We trust that the timely interference of peace officers
     will prevent, for the future, a conduct so degrading to society,
     and so reproachful to public manners."--(_Times, Oct. 18, 1798._)

Cant phrases, and catch words, have been in use on the stage for many
years, Paul Bedford's sonorous "I believe you my Bo-o-o-o-y," and
Lionel Brough's "That's the sort of man I am," being illustrations of
the fact. Something like these, tickles the fancy of the audience,
and, in very little time, the phrase is all over the town, and in
everybody's mouth.

     "Knight's cant phrase of 'That accounts for it,' is pleasantly

     "Cant Phrases.

     "Our Dramatic Authors have lately amused themselves, and the
     Public, with cant phrases, instead of character, 'That's your
     fort'--'Keep moving'--&c. Young Dibdin, in his _Jew and Doctor_,
     seems to have hit upon the happiest cant, imaginable; 'That
     accounts for it,' which seems applicable in almost all cases.

     "There is no opposition to Government, in the House of
     Commons--for a change of Ministry would ruin the country--_that
     accounts for it_.

     "A very great Personage pays no regard to _Lovers' Vows_: he has
     been disgusted with a _German_ translation--_that accounts for
     it_.

     "Buonaparte wishes to return to Paris, though he should go
     thither as naked as the back of his hand; he prefers
     _soup-maigre_ to water melons--_that accounts for it_.

     "Women complain of the want of Gallantry in men, though the
     modern dress shows more than enough to excite passion, but--_that
     accounts for it_.

     "This cant phrase would comprehend all the science of Logic, if
     properly used, and appropriately designed. It might be amplified,
     in the present instance, to any length of space, but
     exemplification breaks off because _ne quid nimis_--_that
     accounts for it_."--(_Times, Dec. 14, 1798._)

     "The mania of private acting, rages with more fury than ever.
     There are, at present, no less than six Private Theatres, in the
     Cities of Westminster, and London. This is a kind of amusement
     which, on the ground of _morality_, should be 'more honoured in
     the breach than the observance,' and calls for the interference
     of the Magistracy."--(_Times, Dec. 26, 1798._)

     "During the representation of the play of _Macbeth_, at a
     Provincial Theatre, some nights since, an incident occurred,
     which totally disconcerted all the gravity of the Tragic Muse. In
     the Banquet Scene, Banquo's murderer was, by some untoward
     accident, missing, and the business of the drama was threatened
     with suspension, when in the exigency of the moment, an ignorant
     candle-snuffer was pushed forward to tell the horrible tale:--on
     seeing him, _Macbeth_, who had been motionless with confusion,
     and embarrassment, burst from his state of torpor, and exclaimed,
     'There's blood upon thy face!' 'Is there by G--,' cried the
     astonished clown, and clapping his hands to his cheek, with a
     mixture of anger, and alarm, continued, 'Then that domn'd blunt
     razor has cutten me agen.'"--(_Times, Jan. 7, 1799._)

A notice of the Stage, of this time, would be incomplete, if Ireland's
impudent forgery of "Vortigern and Rowena," were not mentioned. It was
supposed to be an undiscovered play of Shakespeare's, and, with many
other Shakespearean forgeries, was fabricated by W. H. Ireland, who is
classed as follows:--

       "Four forgers born in one prolific age,
       Much critical acumen did engage:
       The first[6] was soon, by doughty Douglas, scar'd,
       Tho' Johnson would have screen'd him, had he dar'd.
       The next had all the cunning of a Scot;[7]
       The third, invention, genius,--may, what not?[8]
       Fraud, now exhausted, only could dispense
       To her fourth son, their threefold impudence."

          [Footnote 6: Wm. Lauder who tried to make Milton out a
          plagiarist,--but his quotations from various Latin authors
          were proved to be false.]

          [Footnote 7: James Macpherson, for his Ossian.]

          [Footnote 8: Chatterton.]

Sheridan believed in the play, and engaged with Samuel Ireland, the
father of the forger, to pay down £300, and half the profits of the
first 60 nights. It was produced at Drury Lane Theatre, on 2 Ap.
1796, Kemble, playing Vortigern. He was an unbeliever in the
authenticity of the MS., and, certainly, did not attempt to uphold it
by his acting. In fact he burst the bubble, altogether, in the fifth
Act, by emphasising, with much meaning, the words, "And when this
solemn mockery is o'er," that the audience caught at it, and, amidst a
chorus of yells, and hisses, the play was utterly condemned. W. H.
Ireland soon afterwards confessed all his forgeries.

OPERA AND BALLET.


If there were good Actors, in those days, there were also good
singers, traditions of whom have lasted until our time. Of course,
they were fewer than the Actors, because there was but one Opera--and
the operas, then in vogue, required but a very limited number of
artists.

Still, the names of several of the _prime donne_ are yet remembered,
and the names of Mara, Storace, and Crouch will always live in the
annals of song.

_Elizabeth Mara_, whose maiden name was Schmelling, was born at Cassel
in 1750. She commenced her musical education by playing on the violin,
but, subsequently, finding she had a good voice, she devoted herself
to its cultivation, and so far succeeded, as even to earn unqualified
approbation, and applause, from Frederick the Great--who was, as a
rule, absolutely indifferent to Music. She first came to England, in
1784, and chiefly resided here till 1802; when she retired to Moscow,
where she had property, which, however, was destroyed at the French
Invasion, and destruction of the city, in 1812, and she was reduced to
poverty. She then went to reside at Revel, where her old friends
kindly helped to support her. She came once more to London, in 1819,
and gave a Concert--but her voice was gone, and this was her last
effort. She went back to Revel, where she died, in 1833, aged 84.

[Illustration: At Church.]

[Illustration: The Celebrated Mademoiselle G--m--rd, or Grimhard from
Paris.]

_Anne, Selina Storacé_, was born in England, and was sister of the
celebrated Composer. She was an excellent actress, a beautiful singer,
and was universally popular. She died in 1814.

Of _Mrs. Crouch_, née Phillips, I have already written, slightly, as
an Actress. She was born in 1763, and went early on the stage, making
her début, at Drury Lane, in the play of "The Lord of the Manor," in
1780, so that she was but 17. In 1784, she went to Ireland, where her
admirers were numerous, and some most passionate. One young man, whose
affection she did not return, declared he would shoot both her, and
himself--and went to the theatre, ostensibly to carry out his threat,
but he was ejected from the building, and, ultimately, left the
country.

But there was, about this time, a very romantic episode in her life.
She was loved by a young man, heir to a title, and fortune, and she
returned his love. Naturally, under the circumstances, his family had
higher matrimonial aims for him, so the young people had no other
course open to them, than a clandestine Marriage. They were even
before the Altar, of a Roman Catholic Chapel, but the priest refused
to marry them, on hearing the name of the bridegroom, unless he had
his father's consent. No priest could be found to marry them, for the
lover was under age, so the love lorn couple eloped, hoping, at some
seaside port to find a ship for Scotland. They were followed by both
irate fathers, Mr. Phillips having informed the other. The lovers were
separated, but history is silent as to whether they ever met again.

After she got over this disappointment, which took some time, she
married Lieutenant Crouch of the Navy,--good looking, but dissipated,
and spendthrift.--Of course the marriage was not a happy one, and they
parted:

Her voice was exquisitely sweet, and she was a most graceful actress.
She kept her hold on the public, and was on the stage until a short
time before her death, in 1805.

The names of Incledon, and Braham, have only to be mentioned, to
recall their vocal triumphs.

_Benjamin Charles Incledon_, was the son of a surgeon--and was born at
St. Keveran, in Cornwall, in 1764. He made his first appearance, in
London, in 1790--when he played in "The poor Soldier." He, at once,
became a public favourite, and so continued until his retirement from
the stage, which was some time before his death, in 1826. His acting
was clumsy, and ungraceful, but his sweet voice rendered him
unequalled in ballad singing, which was his especial forte.

_John Braham_, (or more correctly _Abraham_,) was born of Jewish
parents, in London, A.D. 1774. Early left an orphan, he was brought up
by Leoni, a celebrated Italian Singer, and so well taught by him, was
he, that he came out, as a public vocalist, before he was eleven years
old, when he sang _bravura_ songs, which had been written for Madame
Mara. After singing, both in English, and Italian, Opera, he went to
Italy--and, after his return, he appeared at Covent Garden, in 1801.
He died in 1856.

_Michael Kelly_ was both composer, and singer, but he cannot take rank
with either Incledon, or Braham. He made his first appearance on the
stage of the Metropolis, at Drury Lane, in 1787. He composed elegant,
and pretty, airs, and he sang nicely, but many of his compositions are
said to have had their origin in Italian, and German, sources. This
gave rise to a _bon mot_ of Sheridan's, when he heard that Kelly had
turned wine merchant--he suggested that, over his door, should be
painted, "Michael Kelly, composer of wine, and importer of music."
Died 1826.

[Illustration: Ballet at the King's Theatre,--Pantheon,--1791.]

Far more eminent than he, as composers, were _Arnold_, _Shield_,
_Storacé_, _Linley_, and _Jackson_.

_Samuel Arnold_, Mus. Doc., was born in 1740--and had the advantage of
studying music under Nares. He was, during his lifetime, both organist
to the King, and to Westminster Abbey, wrote several Oratorios, and
published selections of sacred music--but it is as a composer for the
theatre, that we have to consider him. When only twenty-three years of
age, he was appointed composer to Covent Garden Theatre, and his
earliest operas were there produced. In 1776, he filled the same
position with regard to the Haymarket, and this versatile genius
composed Operas, and Oratorios, until his death in 1802.

_William Shield_ (born in 1754) carved his own way up to the eminence,
which he enjoyed, in his profession. Apprenticed to a boatbuilder, he
gave up that business, as soon as he was out of his time: and, being
musical, and, playing well on the violin, he soon obtained a situation
at Scarborough, as leader of Concerts there, and gained such a
reputation, that he was offered, and accepted, the position of first
Viola, at the Italian Opera House. His first theatrical work was
composing the Music, (in 1778), to "The Flitch of Bacon." He wrote the
music for many other plays--and, on the death of Sir W. Parsons, he
gained the appointment of "Master of his Majesty's Musicians in
ordinary." He died in 1829.

In spite of his foreign name, Stephen Storacé, was born in England,
although of Italian parentage. He was early sent to Italy, and studied
at the Conservatorio of St. Onophris, at Naples, in 1787, being then
24 years of age. He returned to England, and, soon afterwards, was
appointed Composer to Drury Lane; and, up to his death, in 1796, he
was actively engaged on Operas, &c.

_Thomas Linley_ received his musical education from Chilcott, the
organist at Bath. One of his daughters, Eliza, married Sheridan, and,
soon after the production of his first theatrical essay, "The Duenna,"
he became joint patentee, with his son-in-law, in Drury Lane Theatre,
and, leaving Bath, went to reside in London. There, he wrote for the
Stage, and composed many operas, besides songs, madrigals, &c. He
received a severe shock, when his son was drowned, in 1778--and,
although he lived till 1795, he never recovered from it.

William Jackson (whose _Te Deum_ is, or was, such a favourite), was
born, at Exeter, in 1730, and was afterwards Organist to the Cathedral
of that city. He did not write much for the Stage, preferring sacred
music, songs, and canzonets.

The following paragraph shows a curious state of things at the
Opera:--

     "When the Gallery at the Opera House, on Saturday night,
     expressed its disapprobation of the crowded stage, _Sir John
     Gallini_!!![9] who was part of that crowd, _very modestly_
     declared, that, unless the gentlemen behind the scenes left the
     House, there would be no Opera.--But, upon being asked where the
     _half guineas_ should remain, if the gentlemen retired, this
     _shark for words_ recanted his former assertion, and, very
     composedly, swallowed the gilded pill."--(_Morning Post, Apr. 10,
     1788._)

          [Footnote 9: Sir John Gallini, was connected with the
          Theatre. It was to him that "The Monster," was sent to learn
          dancing.]

[Illustration: The Operatical Finale to the Ballet of "Alonzo e
Caro."]

The same paper (15 Ap. 1788) in its Notice "to Correspondents" rather
injures him with its forbearance. "The various articles sent to this
paper against Mr. Gallini, previous to his Benefit, we have uniformly
refused to insert, being unwilling to injure a POOR MAN, at so
important a period."

     "How we are ruined! Bruni, the new singer, has 1400 guineas, Mara
     1000, and a benefit, and Millerd, 1000 for the present Opera
     season."--(_Times, Febr. 16, 1793._)

     "Haymarket Opera. Almost all the subscribers, in Town, graced the
     Boxes, with the Prince of Wales, and Duke of Clarence, at the
     head of the list. The Pit had some pretty, as well as well
     dressed, women; but we were sorry to observe several of the
     gentlemen in round hats, and many of them slovenly to a degree,
     descending even to boots. This ought not to be
     permitted."--(_Times, Jan. 13, 1794._)

     OPERA.

     "Il Capriccio Dramatico, considerably curtailed, on Saturday,
     again introduced Signora Negri, and her reception was again most
     flatteringly favorable. The Burletta has to boast some very
     beautiful music, and the _Finale_ in particular is much indebted
     to the exertions of the performers. So far, all was peace, and
     harmony. Would we could say the same of Don Giovanni, whose
     reception was, throughout, disapproved. So determined an
     opposition to this kind of entertainment we have never witnessed:
     and, indeed, some of the occurrences were so peculiarly
     _striking_, as to baffle all description. Several blows passed in
     the pit; and one gentleman, who was remarkably forward in having
     a slap at Don Juan, got a slap in the face from an enraged
     _amateur_, who, perhaps, would have been better employed in
     _beating_ time. In short, till the fall of the curtain, Morelli's
     pretty Venetian Ballad, excepted, which gained an encore, all was
     noise and uproar; and the scene of Hell, magnificent, and
     terrific, as it was, had so far the characteristic accompanyment
     of _groans_, not of the damned, but of those troubled spirits who
     wished to torment the Manager.

     "The Procession was totally omitted, and several other judicious
     alterations made, but, as the sense of the subscribers, as well
     as the public, seems decidedly against a repetition of this
     Opera, we have no doubt but the Manager will submit,
     respectfully, to their _fiat_--comforting himself with the
     _reflection_, that his liberal exertions deserve--though it is
     not always in the power of mortals to command--success.

     "The Opposition to the new Opera of Don Giovanni, on Saturday
     night, is said to have been preconcerted: and it was known in the
     morning of that day that there was to be a riot. In one part of
     the Pit, the disturbance became so serious, that two Gentlemen
     called each other out, and agreed to meet, as yesterday morning.
     Sir W. H. was at the head of the opposition party. In justice to
     the Manager of the Opera, it should be recollected by those who
     are dissatisfied with the present company of performers, that the
     same unprecedented circumstances which prevented several Dancers
     from leaving France, also deterred several singers from coming
     from Italy, as they must pass through a part of France. This
     inconvenience is only of a temporary nature, and cannot be
     prevented. In the meantime, the subscribers, and the public, have
     the most magnificent, as well as the most commodious, theatre in
     Europe to resort to."--(_Times, Mar. 10, 1794._)

       *       *       *       *       *

     "_Tweedle dum_, and _Tweedle twee_--the Soprano, and Tenor, of
     the Italian Opera are objects equally important, no doubt, in the
     eye of the public. Instead of _high notes_ they have gone to
     _high words_. Signor _Tenor_, not having taken the precaution to
     soap his nose,--Signor _Soprano_ got fast hold, and gave it a
     musical shake, not perfectly in unison with the feelings of the
     tenor, who, now, if he wishes to sleep in a whole skin, will, no
     doubt, alter the _tenor_ of his conduct!!"--(_Times, Jan. 14,
     1795._)

     "The Opera.--The Public are acquainted, that on Saturday
     se'nnight there was a violent disturbance at the Opera House, in
     consequence of the Subscribers shewing great dissatisfaction at
     the want of novelty in the Performances. The Manager, having
     understood that the greatest clamour came from the Boxes of the
     Countess Spencer, and Mr. Pole, Mr. Taylor (a few days since)
     sent a letter to her Ladyship, and Mr. Pole, saying, that as they
     were not satisfied with the Performances, he desired to return
     them their subscription money, which he did. The Subscribers have
     taken up this business, which they consider as a gross affront,
     and disrespect, and yesterday there was a meeting of them at the
     Thatched House Tavern, the result of which we have not learnt. We
     are sorry that there should be any misunderstanding respecting an
     Entertainment, where harmony only ought to prevail: and, we are
     equally concerned, that the Manager should, so indiscreetly, send
     such a letter to Lady Spencer, who is the last person in the
     world who would be suspected of any impropriety of behaviour,
     for, a Lady of greater accomplishments, and more unaffected
     manners, is not to be found in the whole circle of
     Nobility."[10]--(_Times, Febr. 20, 1795._)

          [Footnote 10: _Feb. 29._--A long Advertisement appeared in
          the form of an apology from Mr. Taylor to the Duke of Leeds,
          who presided at the Meeting of the Subscribers at the
          Thatched House.]

     "The excuse for the _rows_, in a certain box, at the Opera, is,
     that the Gentlemen come in tipsy. This is an excuse, (whether
     good, or bad, we will not determine) for the Gentlemen. But, as
     we take for granted the Ladies are not tipsy, pray what excuse is
     to be offered them?"--(_Times, Dec. 26, 1796._)

[Illustration: Mdlle. Parisot.]

The Ballet does not receive so much attention in the public press, as
the Opera--and, as far as I know, there are no means of getting at the
biographies of the _premieres danseuses_.

The first of note during this period is Mdlle. _Guimard_, who was
then playing in the ballet of "Ninette." It is _just possible_ that
there may be a suspicion of caricature in the illustration.

The Ballet was a special feature at the Pantheon Theatre (the site of
which is now occupied by Messrs. W. & A. Gilbey of Oxford Street),
which was built as a counter attraction to Carlisle House, then
popularly conducted by Madame Cornelys, of whom more anon.

     "The _Pas Trois_, introduced into the Ballet at the Opera House
     on Tuesday night, for the first time, had a very pretty effect.
     It goes to the tune of 'God save the King,' and is intended as a
     compliment to his Majesty."--(_Times, Feb. 16, 1793._)

       *       *       *       *       *

     "Simonet, the dancer, and Grenier, who keeps the hotel in Jermyn
     Street, were, last week, ordered to depart the
     kingdom."[11]--(_Times, March 26, 1793._)

          [Footnote 11: Probably for political reasons.]

The centre figure in this illustration is M. Didelot--and the danseuse
on the left, is Miss Rose, an English-woman, who was not bewitchingly
handsome, though a good ballerina. The lady on the right is probably
Mdlle. Parisot.

     "The OPERA.--The mania of expectation was, on Saturday night, at
     the very acme of curiosity. The Pit was so crowded even before
     the drawing up of the curtain, that it was not possible to edge
     another face into the area. Stars, garters, feathers, and
     turbans, were so jumbled, and intermixed, at the doors, that all
     sex and identity were indistinguishable. The stage itself was
     crammed on all sides, and in such a manner, as to render the
     shifting of the scenery 'a work of labour, and a service of
     danger.' So eager, indeed, was the desire of seeing Didelot and
     Rose, that the wings were crowded with Ladies. Amongst those
     Ladies who thus made their _first appearance_ on the stage, we
     heard some very respectable, and titled names.

     "The new Ballet of _Les Trois Sultanes_ taken from _Marmontel
     Hillisberg_, is the '_Cock-nosed English-woman_,' yet while we
     remember _Abingdon_ and _Jordan_ in Roxalana, with all the
     roguishness of language, mere action must appear dull, and
     unentertaining. It were injustice, to be sure, to decide what
     effect the Ballet might have produced, could it have been
     fairly exhibited: but the stage was so very full, that figure
     dancers could scarce round a horse-shoe to trip in, and no
     performer could make an exit. _Didelot_ and _Rose_ appeared
     again in the Ballet, lugged in without character, merely to shew
     themselves. We hope that some Ballet will be got up wherein they
     may display the fulness of those powers, and talents, which the
     great world allow them to possess."--(_Times, Feb. 22, 1796._)

       *       *       *       *       *

     "The Stage at the Opera is so crowded, that Madame Rose, in
     throwing up her fine muscular arm into a graceful attitude,
     inadvertently levelled three men of the first quality at a
     stroke."--(_Times, May 9, 1796._)

[Illustration: Durham Mustard too powerful for Italian Capers--1798.]


Mdlle. Parisot.

The length of Mdlle. Parisot's skirts would have delighted the Bishop
of Durham (Shute Barrington), who was much exercised in his mind, in
1798, as to the brevity of those worn by the ladies of the ballet. He
seems to have entered into a crusade against the ballet, before he
made his memorable speech in the House of Lords, on 2nd March,
1798--for the next illustration is dated January in that year.

It was, however, on the occasion of the second reading of Esten's
divorce bill, that the wrath of the Right Reverend Father in God,
fairly boiled over, and the _Times_ of 3rd March, reports him to have
spoken thus. "He considered it a consequence of the gross
immoralities, imported of late years, into this kingdom, from France;
the Directory of which country, finding that they were not able to
subdue us by their arms, appeared as if they were determined to gain
their ends by destroying our morals. They had sent over persons to
this country, who made the most indecent exhibitions on our Theatres;
exhibitions which would not have been allowed even in France; and
which, so far from being allowable in a Christian Country, would have
disgraced the ancient Theatres of Athens and Rome.

"It was his intention to move, on some future day, that an Address be
presented to his Majesty, beseeching him to order all such persons out
of the Kingdom, as people who were likely to destroy our morality, and
religion; and who were very probably, in the pay of France."

This tirade made him a fitting subject for the Caricaturists, and they
did not forget him.

In a picture by Gillray, 14th Mar. 1798, "Operatical Reform, or La
Danse à l'Evêque," we recognise Miss Rose, on the extreme right of the
three ladies, who have little other covering for their bodies but the
episcopal apron and lawn sleeves. At the foot, is this verse--

  "'Tis hard for such new-fangled orthodox rules,
  That our Opera troupe should be blamed;
  Since, like our first Parents, they only (poor fools!)
  Danced naked, and were not ashamed."

And there was yet another amusing Caricature of the Prelate, in
connection with this subject. In July 1798, Gillray published a
picture of "More short Petticoats, or the Highland Association under
Episcopal Examination." The Bishop is accompanied by Lord Salisbury,
the then Lord Chamberlain, and inspects the Kilts of three
Highlanders, who assure him "You'll find them exactly according to the
rules of the Highland Association." But the Bishop's modesty is
blushing violently, and he replies "Don't tell me of rules, I say it's
abominable! It's about half a foot too short according to the opera
Standard. Bring the large breeches directly; why, the _figurantes_
would be ashamed of it."

Duty.--1798]




MASQUERADES, CONCERTS, &c.


Masquerades were introduced into England by Henry 8th, but, perhaps,
at no time were they so fashionable, as during the latter half of the
18th Century, although they do not always seem to have been
successful. The _Morning Post_, Feb. 6, 1788, speaks of a Masquerade
at the Opera House, thus:--"The Supper and Wines were consistent with
the well known parsimonious principle of the conductor, the provision
being very unequal to the _appetite_, and _number_, of the guests. The
music was very indifferent." Thus we see that these amusements were
not of equal quality, and the Critics did not fear to say what they
thought of them.

     "Pantheon, Jan. 26, 1788. The Nobility and Gentry are
     respectfully acquainted that the First Masqued Ball, at this
     place, will be on Thursday next, the 31st Instant. There will be
     a Supper as usual, with Wines, &c. Tickets at One Guinea each may
     be had at the Office."--(_Morning Post, Jan. 26, 1788._)

This Masquerade seemed to be very popular.

     "The Prince's visit to the Brandenburgh-house Masquerade was to
     have been in _female habiliments_; but the shortness of the
     notice did not allow time for preparing them, and neither the
     shoes, corsette, nor robe, of Mrs. Vanneck, for which his Royal
     Highness sent, could be made capacious enough for a momentary
     covering. The sailor's habit was, therefore, adopted without any
     preparation for the character. The Margravine's Masqued Ball
     produced many whimsical events, but none more than that from a
     character representing Acteon, who, in brandishing a huge pair of
     _antlers_, run full _butt_ against a French looking-glass of 300
     guineas value, and smashed it to pieces. The Margrave being near,
     endeavoured to give the accident a pleasant turn, by remarking in
     German 'that there could be no jollity where they let the _glass
     stand_.'"--(_Times, March 1, 1794._)

       *       *       *       *       *

     "The MASQUERADE.

     "The entertainment given by the Manager of the Opera House, on
     Monday night, was the best attended of any we have seen for many
     years, and fully answered the expectations that had been formed
     of it. The space allotted, however, large as it was, with the
     addition of the new room, and another above stairs, was by no
     means sufficient for so large a company: and the pressure of the
     crowd rendered the rooms insufferably hot, as well as prevented
     the masks from appearing to advantage. For so large an assembly,
     there were fewer masks than usual, but the hilarity of the
     company made amends for this deficiency. The Prince of Wales was
     in a black domino, arm-in-arm with Captain Churchill, and Lord
     George Conway; the Duke of Clarence was the whole evening with
     Mrs. _Jordan_ in a private box upstairs. _Michael Angelo Taylor_
     was dressed in women's cloaths, but was less talkative than
     usual. The supper was extremely well conducted, and the
     provisions better than usual. The refreshments were also
     liberally supplied. There were about 2700 persons in the rooms,
     and among them some of the prettiest women in town."--(_Times,
     March 5, 1794._)

       *       *       *       *       *

     "MASQUERADE AT THE OPERA HOUSE.

     "On Thursday night, for the first time this season, there was a
     grand masquerade at this House, which was very numerously
     attended, as every room was crowded, and the numbers computed
     at about 1600. A party of _Bon-vivans_, unmasked, came into the
     rooms about two o'clock, who had evidently made too free use of
     the juice of the grape. The primitive dress of one of them, who
     appeared to be a Quaker, did not quite accord with his manners,
     which were more prone to the flesh than the spirit. Although the
     new regulations in price is in favour of Masquerades, yet the
     freedom of conversation which is allowed in these motley
     meetings, became, on this occasion, indecent ribaldry, and
     licentiousness. The _lowness_ of the price of admission was in a
     great measure the cause of introducing many _low_ visitors, who
     made themselves obnoxious to delicacy, and good manners, by the
     coarsest language."--(_Times, Feb. 17, 1798._)

[Illustration: Madame Cornelys.]

There is a paragraph in the _Times_ of August 23, 1797, whereby "hangs
a tale"--

     "The miserable death of Mrs. Cornelys, in the Fleet Prison, adds
     another melancholy instance to the catalogue of vicissitudes in
     what is generally termed _fashionable life_. She was formerly the
     law-giver of the circles of dissipation, and gaiety, yet closed
     her existence in the hospital room of the prison, in which she
     had obtained permission to reside, by the kindness of the
     Warden."

The history of Teresa Cornelys is very singular, showing how a
nobody--for no one knows even from what part of Germany she
came--could come here, and, by her business qualities, and tact,
become a person absolutely indispensable to Society. All we know of
her is that she was supposed to be a German, who had been a public
singer, both in France, and Germany, and that she came over here about
1756 or 1757. Whether there was a Herr Cornelys alive, we have no
knowledge--but she had a son, and daughter. That she was not bad
looking, is evidenced by her portrait, which must have been taken in
her declining years: that she must have been shrewd, business-like,
and possessed of much _savoir faire_, is undeniable--for she held
"Society" in her grasp, and, for a time, made it do just what she
wanted.

What she did for the first five, or six years, after her coming to
England is not known, but she must have been possessed of some
Capital, or she could not have taken, as she did, Carlisle House--a
mansion in Soho Square. Here she started a sort of fashionable Social
Club, called "The Society," either in 1762, or 1763, and this was its
programme. "The subscription is seven guineas for twelve nights, one
ticket each, which introduces only one person, whether gentleman, or
lady; but there are frequent subscriptions in the year, and two ladies
may be admitted six nights on one subscription. No person can be
admitted a Subscriber to this Society, but through the recommendation
of a subscriber. Four ladies of quality, having each of them a book,
have the joint management, direction, and choice, of the subscribers;
every one's name must be entered in one of those ladies' books.

"A non-subscriber can only be admitted by a subscriber's ticket,
writing his, or her name on the back; in consequence of which rule,
and to avoid the possibility of improper company, their names are,
immediately after the night is over, printed, and hung up in the outer
room.

"The doors are opened, at 9 o'clock, of the lower rooms, which consist
of six, each superior to the other; few people, however, assemble
before 10, and those who profess themselves of the genteelest order,
not till eleven, when they walk about, and amuse themselves with
accosting their acquaintance, and forming themselves into select
parties for the evening; then regaling with jellies, syllabubs, cakes,
orgeat, lemonade, fruits, &c., prepared in a kind of arched shelving
all round the hangings of the tea room.

"At ten, the upper flight of rooms open, which consist of two large
rooms, besides a very large ball room, furnished, and hung, in the
most superb taste, with an exceeding good band of music in an
orchestra erected at the upper end, and rows of benches, down the
sides, placed one above the other. In this room they dance country
dances, but no minuets at all.

"At half-past eleven, the company in general repair to tea, and have
small round tables for their separate parties.

"At twelve, the Cotillion gallery opens, with another range of seven
rooms underground, which, from the vast variety of furniture and
ornaments, the grandeur, and magnificence, of some, the elegant
simplicity of others, together with the amazing beauty of the lights,
one of the principal excellencies of the whole, form a view, on
descending a perpendicular flight of stairs most sumptuously, and
pleasingly, striking.

"In these lower range of rooms, the company finish the evening, the
young in dancing cotillions, the others in looking on; for there are
no cards, nor gaming, of any kind. At one, the company begin to
separate, and continue going till four, but the major part break up
about two."

By which set of rules we see that Madame Cornelys, started her
establishment in the strictest propriety, whatever became of it
afterwards; and these rules were strictly carried out. The rooms, on
off nights, were used for other purposes; for instance, she, knowing
the power of the class, gave a servants' ball; and the Old Westminster
scholars held their Anniversary Meeting in her rooms.

Her prosperity excited envy, and many were the rumours set afloat, to
her detriment. For instance, in 1766, it was said she owed her late
cook £50, and that she had run away from her ruined creditors, to
France, with many thousand pounds.

She had to contradict these reports, and said that she had, within
thirteen months, spent £11,000, on the house, &c.

Concerts, both instrumental and vocal, were given at Carlisle House,
and the tickets for them, which survive, are very beautiful, many of
them being drawn by Cipriani, and engraved by Bartolozzi.

The Royal Family used to patronise her _soirées_, as did also the King
of Denmark, when he visited England in 1768.

Early in 1770, she gave her first Masquerade, which immediately
lowered the tone of her establishment, and was the precursor of her
downfall. This was under the patronage of the "Tuesday Night's Club,"
and the Dukes of Gloucester, and Cumberland--besides numbers of the
aristocracy of both sexes, were present, and it was a very brilliant
affair.

She had another grand Masquerade on 6 February 1771, to which the
price of admission was two and a half guineas. The same Royalty was
present, and also the leading Nobility--Among the masques were five
devils, a bear, and, worst of all bad taste, a shrouded corpse in a
coffin, (said to be a brother of Colonel Luttrell), but he was, after
a short time, ejected by some pseudo sailors.

[Illustration: The Female Coterie.]

From this time her fortunes declined--she was twice fined £50 for
performing Operas, under the guise of harmonic meetings, and Guadagni,
her principal vocalist, had been fined £50 for singing in the same,
and these musical performances were put a stop to.

But, in spite of all her enemies could do to her, she still had some
friends, if we can believe the _London Chronicle_, 19-21 February
1771.

"A certain D----s, who is a principal promoter of the New Opera
House, declared, lately, she would persist in support of Mrs. C.,
whatever was the consequence, 'for,' said she, 'I hate the thoughts of
mixing with any body merely because they have half a guinea in their
pocket; and that such scums should sit on the same bench, and think
themselves on a level with the first nobility!' 'I agree with you'
(says Lady A----r), 'and am grieved to think that we are, one day or
other to mix in heaven with the dregs of the people.' 'God forbid'
(says the D----s), 'I should ever be in such company.'"

The Subscription balls, and Masquerades still went on--and she
instituted a society called "the Coterie," which had not the
reputation of insisting on the strictest morality on the part of its
members.

This _coterie_ broke up. The Pantheon was built, and opened, in
opposition to her. Perhaps she was extravagant, but, anyhow, from some
cause or other, she became bankrupt, and was so gazetted on the 9th
Nov. 1772, as a "chapwoman, and dealer in gloves." Her goods were sold
in Dec. 1772, and it must have been a famous sale, as the Catalogues,
to admit two, were five shillings each.

She, herself, was taken to a debtor's prison, where she could not have
stopped very long, as there are advertisements of Masquerades
conducted by her, at Carlisle House, in the spring and summer of 1773.

She was again a bankrupt in Dec. 1774, and Carlisle House was
advertised to be sold. Still, somehow or other, she must have found
friends, with money, to help her, for she issued an advertisement, 15
January 1776. "Mrs. Cornelys most respectfully takes the liberty to
acquaint the nobility, and gentry, that, through the kind assistance
of her friends, she is again reinstated in Carlisle House, on her own
account."

But nothing could bring back her old patrons, and the social status of
her masked balls got lower and lower. Worse than all, the refreshments
were not so plentiful as of old, as we may see in the "Citizen's
Complaint to the Priestess of Soho," which concludes thus--

  "Yet fairy scenes and preparations,
  With all your novel decorations,

  To feed the Fancy than the Belly."

In 1778, Carlisle House was again to be sold, but still Madame
Cornelys, somehow, kept her clutches on it. She established an
"Academy of Sciences and Belles Lettres"--a Library with Newspapers,
&c.--and a debating society, open to both Sexes. This "School of
Eloquence" collapsed in 1781. Scientific lectures, Joseph Borouwlaski,
the Polish Dwarf, and some more Masquerades, were all tried, but
without avail, to resuscitate her fallen fortunes. It was said that
she gave four and a half Masquerades, the half being accounted for, by
the fact that no license had been taken out, and the masquers were
ejected.

After 1782 Carlisle House seems to have been shut up; on 28 June 1785,
Christie sold the furniture, China, and other effects; and in 1788 the
old Mansion was pulled down, and what was the grand Saloon has been
altered into a Roman Catholic Chapel, St. Patrick's, Soho.

There is no record of Madame for some years, but we know from
Newspaper notices, that in 1792 she took a large house and grounds in
Knightsbridge Road, formerly occupied by a dealer in Asses milk, and
converted it into a "female archery."

Luck was against her, this failed; she was very old, had fought her
fight, and now the refuge for the remainder of her days was the Fleet
Prison. There, however, she met with kindness from friends, and help
from her daughter, who was very accomplished, and no more is heard of
her, until the paragraph in the _Times_, which heads this memoir.

     "Masquerade at Marlboro House.

     "At the Duchess of Marlborough's Gala, on Wednesday evening, one
     of the principal ornaments was the _statute_ of Precedency,
     elegantly illuminated, in variegated lamps over the grand
     entrance. Lyon, Clarencieux, and Garter, Kings-at-Arms, in their
     coats of office, were stationed in the hall, and marshalled the
     guests upon their arrival. Upon the first landing place, were Her
     Grace's Vice-Chamberlain, and three Masters of the Ceremonies,
     attended by deputy Masters, and the Pages of the Presence, and
     back staircase. In the antechamber, covers were provided for the
     Lord Mayor, and Sheriffs of London, whose pease were said to be
     served cold, but his Lordship eat his peaches without hazarding
     any remarks. His Mace was thought to be one of the finest pieces
     of sculpture ever executed in pastry. It contained a fine
     pine-apple in the capital, with a beautiful crown in
     Naples-biscuit, and his chair was entirely composed of barley
     sugar drops. In the next room were the Barons and Baronesses, the
     newly created ones next the door, and the premier Baron very
     near, but not in contact with the lowest Viscount, in the
     corridor of the third chamber. The Lord Chamberlain, the Lords of
     the Bedchamber, the Gold and Silver Sticks, &c., had their wands
     of the best double refined sugar, excepting the Gold Stick, whose
     staff was of barley-sugar, or as some say sugar-candy.

     "In the inner rooms, according to their rank, and date, were
     placed the Earls, Marquisses, and Dukes of England. The premier
     Duke, and E. M., nearest to the Noble Hostess. The Lords on the
     cross bench were served with some difficulty by _Beefeaters_, who
     were obliged to move like the Knights at Chess, which had a very
     pretty effect. It added to the liveliness, and gaiety of the
     meeting, that every mask had for its neighbour, on both hands,
     the same individual it conversed with so frequently at Mr.
     Hasting's trial, which made the 'I know you,' and 'Who are you?'
     exceedingly facetious and happy. The Lords of the Bedchamber were
     in high glee, and spirits, but were discovered by their jokes,
     some of which were remembered upon former occasions. The Maids of
     Honour were in perfect character and detected in an
     instant."--(_Times, June 21, 1799._)

Music was much in vogue both publicly and in private. Concerts were
plentiful, the most aristocratic, perhaps, being held in Willis's
Rooms, of which I will give one Advertisement, relating to a ball.

     Advt.--"Assembly Rooms, King Street, St. James's Square.

     "Willis humbly begs leave to acquaint the Nobility, and Gentry,
     Subscribers, that the first Ball, this season, commences This
     Day.

     "The Rooms will be lighted at Ten, and the Ball will be opened at
     Half-past Ten o'clock, precisely.

     "_N.B._--By order of the Ladies (Directresses), no person
     whatever will be admitted without producing their ticket, and no
     ticket but those of the night, can possibly be admitted.

     "The Nobility and Gentry are most earnestly requested to order
     their Coachmen to set down, and take up, with their horses'
     heads towards St. James's Street.

     "The side doors are for chairs only."--(_Morning Post, Feb. 14,
     1788._)

[Illustration: A Country Concert, or, An Evening's Entertainment in
Sussex.]

This refers only to the subscription Balls, which were so famous, and
so select--but, as I said above, this was the chiefest Concert Hall. A
greater libel against the English nation never was uttered, than when
it was said they were not a musical nation--and it was, essentially,
in Chamber music, glees, madrigals, ballads--small home concerts in
which a few friends met together and spent a pleasant evening--in
which the harpsichord, or pianoforte (for that instrument was then in
vogue), joined with the cello, violin, and flute, in pretty, and
harmonious, quartets.

This Illustration shows Mrs. Billington and the Duke of Sussex, with
two friends, thus engaged, and an exceedingly home-like group it is.

It was an unusual thing for ladies, then, to play on any other
instruments than the harpsichord, or piano, and the harp, or guitar;
this latter coming specially into vogue, some twenty years later,
after the Peninsular War, so Mrs. Billington created some surprise.

     "_Mrs. Billington_ who is solicitous for musical distinction in
     any respect, as far as her talents can extend, is now applying,
     with very great diligence, to the _violin_; and, from the present
     state of her progress, it is supposed she will hereafter figure
     amongst the most shining performers on that
     instrument."--(_Morning Post, Feb. 16, 1788._)

Judging by this illustration, the ladies of 1799 were not at all
restricted in their choice of instruments.

_Apropos_ of Concerts, we get several paragraphs about them from one
Newspaper, the _Morning Post_ of Jan. 15, 1789.

     "Since the illness of a certain Great Personage,[12] Lady Young
     has entirely surmounted her _religious qualms_, and is
     determined, once more, in defiance of the proclamation, to fix
     her Concerts on the Sabbath Day. Thus, Politics and religion,
     and music, go hand in hand."

          [Footnote 12: The King's first attack of insanity.]

     "Lord Hampden, Lord Cholmondeley, the Duke of Queensbury, Lady
     Petres, the Duchess of Bolton, Lady Bridget Tollemache, &c., &c.,
     will have their alternate concerts, as usual."

     "The dissensions continually subsisting between the different
     performers and directors of the Tottenham Street Concert,[13]
     added to the present indisposition of its Royal Patron, and the
     daily decrease of subscribers, will, it is feared, reduce that
     _light_ amusement to its primitive obscurity."

          [Footnote 13: Ancient Music.]

     "Should Cramer quit the above Concert, it will be a loss not to
     be repaired, as they might as well attempt to proceed without
     Harrison, as without that incomparable leader. Mr. Bate may
     conduct, but he cannot lead; every man may _blow the bellows_,
     but it is certainly more difficult to _play the organ_."

     "Lord Uxbridge's new Music Room in _Vigo Lane_, will be opened in
     the course of this season; the time is not yet fixed, but it is
     supposed it will be as magnificent a _Gala_, as music can afford.
     The extreme care taken that nothing should obstruct the sound,
     has nearly answered every purpose, and it certainly promises to
     be the best _private_ room for music in London;--we hope, when
     filled with company, the small reverberation at present
     remaining, will be entirely dispelled."

It is sad to read of such a case of reverse of fortune as the
following:--

     "A French Marchioness, who a few years since, possessed a fortune
     of £5000 a year, is engaged to sing before their Majesties at the
     Concerts of Antient Music, which commence on Wednesday
     next."--(_Times, Feb. 1, 1794._)

[Illustration: Savoyards of Fashion--1799.]

Of Pictorial Art, we hear but little in Old Times--but the Art Critic
of the _Morning Post_, May 20, 1788, did not fear to speak out, and
give his opinion freely.

     "Royal Academy.

     "235. Theseus receiving the Clue from Ariadne. H. Fuseli.--Poor
     Theseus, with a broken leg, is endeavouring to support Ariadne,
     whose figure suggests more the idea of a _sick ideot_, than a
     beautiful woman. Whilst we pity the situation of these two
     lovers, we cannot forbear laughing at the little cock-tailed
     Minotaur, galoping about, for amusement, in the distance. The
     design, however, has some merit, but Theseus appears as if he had
     left his skin behind him, and, indeed, some of his muscles are
     not in their proper places.

     "181. Portraits of three Children. P. Reinagle, A.--The Colouring
     of this picture is _Currant Jelly_ and _Chalk_. The glare of
     crimson and red, confines the eye, in such a manner, that it is
     difficult to find out what the subject is meant for. This picture
     (like most of this Artist's works) is an imitation of the stile
     of some other master, which is certainly very commendable in a
     painter who possesses no genius of his own; but as we do not
     think this is the case with Mr. Reinagle, we recommend him, as
     before, to look at nature.

     "175. Portrait of a young Gentleman, and his brother, flying a
     Kite. W. R. Bigg, A.--We cannot determine on the likeness of
     these portraits; we are also at a loss to say, whether the
     figures, or the Kite, are drawn with most taste and elegance."

Fuseli opened a Gallery for the display of a series of his paintings
illustrating "Paradise lost."

     Advt.--"The general impression felt by all kinds of people, on
     entering the Milton Gallery, is, this is unlike everything we
     have seen before. The old nurses stories about the devil are
     properly confuted by the exhibition of a figure that is bold,
     daring, and majestic, and a model of muscular strength and
     gigantic symmetry. 'I have often wondered,' said a Lady, 'how Eve
     could have been tempted to transgress by such a hideous monster,
     as Satan has been represented to me: but, if he was, in reality,
     such a being as Mr. Fuseli paints him, why--That accounts for
     it.'"[14]--(_Times, June 17, 1799._)

     "The Fruitery--the model of a neat rural mansion, and contains
     the following figures: first, the Porter, which stands in the
     gate, and, on being addressed, rings a bell, when the door opens,
     the Fruiteress comes out, and any Lady, or Gentleman, may call
     for whatever fruit they please, and the figure will return, and

     varied as often as the company pleases: it will likewise receive
     flowers, or any small articles, carry them in, and produce them
     again, as called for. As the Fruits are brought out, they will be
     given in charge to a Watch Dog, which sits in front of the house,
     and on any person taking away, or touching them, will begin to
     bark, and continue to do so until they are returned. The next
     figure belonging to this piece is, the Little Chimney Sweeper,
     which will be seen coming from behind the house, will enter the

If there was little mention of "Art," in the old newspapers, there was
still less of "Literature," except in the advertisement of new books.

     sharp, the women will run off with all the biographic
     laurels."--(_Morning Post, June 12, 1788._)

Mrs. Thrale's book, "Letters to and from S. Johnson," was published in
1788, and her "Anecdotes of S. Johnson, during the last twenty years
of his life," in 1786. Boswell's "Life of Samuel Johnson," &c., was
published in 1791.

     "The last exit of the celebrated Mr. Gibbon, was attended with

     himself, that he thought there was a probability of his enjoying
     thirteen, or fourteen, more years of life. He had not been long
     in bed, before he was seized with excruciating pains. He
     endeavoured to swallow some brandy, but in vain. He then made a
     signal to his valet to leave the room, and in a few minutes
     expired. He has left everything indiscriminately to a young Swiss
     gentleman, to whom he was attached, and who accompanied him last
     year to this country."--(_Times, Jany. 27, 1794._)

     of printing them. Lady L. G. and Lady C. C. are busily employed
     upon two rival Novels, which are the favourite work for Young
     Ladies at present: and the lawful successors of bell-ropes,
     coronet cushions, and painted flower-pots. Lady G.'s is
     entitled--'Duke or no Duke,' Lady Charlotte's 'All for Nothing.'
     Those who have seen the latter, are loud in the praise of its
     beauties: the plot of the former is not thought to have been
     _well laid_."--(_Times, April 18, 1796._)




MONETARY.


We are apt to think that among the other advantages of progressive
Civilisation which we possess in this latter part of the 19th Century,
Commercial failures and stoppage of Banks are peculiarly our own, but
it was not so; the years 1793 and 1796--the former especially--were
times of severe mercantile depression--the tale of which is best told
in the language of the times.

     "The late considerable failures in the City are no longer to be
     concealed; public credit cannot therefore, suffer the more by our
     publishing the fact. Four very considerable mercantile Houses
     have stopped payment within the last ten days: they are
     principally engaged in American West India Brokerage, and
     Insurance concerns. One house, alone, has failed for £800,000,
     and another for £500,000. It is feared that many more persons
     will become involved in these failures--as there has been a very
     extensive circulation of paper. The failures already known, are
     estimated at three millions, and it is conjectured that they will
     extend to two millions more. They have, naturally, created a
     great scarcity of cash in the City, and the Bank, as well as the
     Bankers, are extremely shy of discounting."--(_Times, Feb. 28,
     1793._)

       *       *       *       *       *

     "Some more very considerable failures have taken place in the
     City, within the last two or three days. A very large African
     house, at Bristol, has likewise stopped payment, and the letters
     from thence advise, that it is feared many more will
     follow."--(_Times, March 10, 1793._)

       *       *       *       *       *

     "The Bankers, in the City, have refused to discount any more
     paper, for the present. The alarm on the Royal Exchange, is
     beyond conception to those who are not in business."--(_Times,
     March 26, 1793._)

     "At the Meeting, on Monday, of the Noblemen, and Gentlemen,
     belonging to the County of Northumberland, we understand that
     £340,000 was subscribed, to support the Newcastle Banks, the
     Proprietors of which, are gentlemen of the first landed property,
     and known to be worth many hundred thousand pounds.

     "The commercial stoppages, we are sorry to learn, have at length
     reached Manchester, and the most serious inconveniencies are to
     be dreaded, if some effectual support is not given to that town.
     The mischief is so much dreaded, that a committee of Gentlemen,
     of that town, have come to London, to offer securities to the
     Bank, provided it will afford a temporary relief to the
     manufacturers who reside there."--(_Times, April 18, 1793._)

       *       *       *       *       *

     "Public Credit.

     "The very depressed state of the public credit of the country, is
     now so universally known, and felt, that it cannot suffer any
     additional injury by our stating the fact, and the means which
     are about to be carried into effect, as an experiment of relief.
     We daily hear of new stoppages among persons, many of whom have
     ever been considered as men of large real property: on a very
     minute, and fair, enquiry into the truth of this supposition, we
     have the best reason to believe that the fact is so; and that a
     very large proportion of mercantile houses, which have been,
     lately, obliged to suspend their payments, is still solvent, and
     well able to pay every demand, in the course of time. At
     Manchester, Liverpool, and other large trading towns,
     particularly at the former, this fact is well authenticated; but
     the failures at the country banks have stopped the circulation of
     money so suddenly, that present engagements have not been able to
     be fulfilled. To adopt a remedy, if possible, at this very
     alarming state of public credit, a meeting was held at Mr. Pitt's
     house, in Downing Street, on Monday last, to consult on the
     business. The grievance being explained to Mr. Pitt, he assured
     the Gentlemen of his anxiety, and readiness to give every
     assistance, in his power, to the mercantile interest, and he
     requested they would consult among themselves, and form some
     specific proposition, for his consideration. A meeting was
     accordingly held, yesterday morning, at the Mansion-house, to
     consider of the plan which should be proposed to Mr. Pitt. The
     number of gentlemen was reduced to 11, as being more convenient:
     and, at nine o'clock last night, they waited on the Minister, to
     obtain his approbation.

     "We do not take upon us to state, OFFICIALLY, the nature of the
     plan which has been proposed, but we are led to believe that the
     outlines of it are as follows: 'That four millions of Exchequer
     Bills should be issued for the support of public credit, as a
     loan to the mercantile interest; that the security required,
     should be on goods actually warehoused, and the advance to be
     made on two-thirds of their value. Commissioners to be appointed
     to superintend the securities, and the value of the merchandise.
     The Exchequer Bills to be called in as they become redeemed. The
     borrowers to be answerable for any loss in the discount of them.'
     The plan was left for Mr. Pitt's consideration, who is to give
     his answer this morning. Should he approve of it, it is probable
     he will propose some resolution upon it, this day, in the House
     of Commons, to the end that the relief may be as speedy as
     possible."--(_Times, April 24, 1793._)

     "The Funds continued falling yesterday, and Consols were below
     60, for money. We shall be very much surprised if there were not
     some very considerable failures before the next settling day.
     Some persons connected with French Houses are known to be great
     losers."--(_Times, July 15, 1796._)

       *       *       *       *       *

     "We yesterday mentioned our expectation that there would be
     considerable failures among persons connected with French Houses,
     before the next settling day. A principal Stockbroker,
     immediately connected with a Gentleman, formerly a Member of the
     Legislative Assembly, in France, was, yesterday declared a
     defaulter at the Stock Exchange. His differences are upon near
     half a million of Stock, which he had purchased at 67 and 68.
     This failure is the commencement of exposing that destructive
     system of gambling, called _continuations_. The Consols were done
     yesterday at 59, for money."--(_Times, July 16, 1796._)

     "Notwithstanding the enormous failures of two Stock brokers,
     whose differences amount to full £100,000, the desperate game of
     _Continuation_ still continues nearly as strong as ever. Bargains
     for time, in Stock, were yesterday made for the next settling
     day, at a rate of 20 per cent., Interest."--(_Times, July 20,

     Funds, which, after having fallen in the early part of the day,
     to 53-1/4, rose, towards the close of the market, to 56-7/8 for
     the October settling. The reason alleged, for this sudden rise,
     was, that Mr. _Hammond_ having been unsuccessful at Berlin, had
     gone from thence to Paris. Such was the report!"--(_Times, Sept.

The following is but a foreshadowing of our Railway Mania:--

     "_Canal Shares_, which at one time rose to £180, are now down to
     £40. The _Mania_ is over; and this _earth-cutting_ business, in a
     great measure, at a stand."--(_Times, Aug. 16, 1796._)

In 1796, there was an extraordinary scarcity of silver, which taxed
severely, the resources of the Government to meet. The difficulty was
met, to some extent, by the issue of Spanish Dollars, taken from
Prizes, and stamped at the Tower, where the Mint then was, with a
small head of the King.--These were issued at 4s. 9d. each--The same
scarcity arose in 1803-4, and the same expedient was resorted
to--only then the dollars were issued at a price over their value, so
as to offer no premium for their destruction.

     "So great is the scarcity, and high price of silver, that the
     silver smiths give 5s. 3d. for a crown piece, and a premium is
     given for shillings."--(_Times, Jan. 7, 1796._)

       *       *       *       *       *

     "_Silver_ is so exceedingly scarce, that there is not a
     sufficient quantity, for exchange, in the channels of business,
     either good, or bad, and yet we are sorry to observe (which we
     have repeatedly) the number of unfortunate victims who are, every
     Session, brought to trial, for coining. Surely the wisdom of the
     Legislature might prevent this evil, by issuing a sufficient
     quantity for the purposes of circulation."--(_Times, Sept. 15,
     1796._)

       *       *       *       *       *

     "The distress for want of Silver, is daily, more and more felt
     among the trading parts of the Metropolis. These are put to the
     greatest inconvenience, for want of a greater circulation; and,
     we understand that those who have many men in their employ, are
     obliged to give one per cent., to procure it. The many complaints
     which are made, on this subject, induces us to hope that the
     issue of a fresh coinage, from the Mint, will speedily take
     place. The want of it has another bad effect, as it increases the
     coining of base half-pence."--(_Times, Sept. 29, 1796._)

     "Yesterday, the Committee of Bankers had another Meeting at Mr.
     Pitt's, to request his interference in procuring them a certain
     quantity of specie, for the demands of their business. The
     Minister returned for answer, that he could only assist them, at
     present, with 50,000 guineas: which, being divided among all the
     Bankers, will not amount to 1000 guineas for each House.

     "We hope that the Bank, instead of issuing dollars at 4s. 6d.,
     will place a value of 5s. on them, in order that they may not
     become an object of traffic: their intrinsic worth is above 4s.
     6d., and they should, therefore, be issued at some higher price,
     in order that they may not be hoarded.

     "There can be no doubt whatever, but that large sums of specie
     have been drawn out of the Bank, and concealed in the houses, or
     gardens, of private persons. As this stoppage of general
     circulation is highly prejudicial to the Public Weal, we have
     only to observe to such persons, that their extreme, and foolish
     timidity, may produce, to themselves, the very consequences they
     seek to avert: and that, instead of being richer, they may fall
     the first victims of their alarms. Wherever large sums of money
     are privately deposited, except it is with those whose occupation
     it is to hold it, such persons are likely to be the first objects
     of popular revenge. The Bank, or the houses of Bankers, are the
     only secure places of deposits."--(_Times, March 3, 1797._)

     "According to letters received, on Wednesday, in town, the Banks
     at Norwich, and at Bath, have stopped payment in specie. Since
     the news reached the country, of the Bank of England stopping
     payment, not a guinea is to be had, in exchange for Bank-notes,
     on any of the Public roads."--(_Times, March 3, 1797._)

     There is the Mint Stamp affixed to each, which consists of the
     King's Head, marked on the King of Spain's neck. We trust that
     this issue of Dollars is intended to make room for a new
     importation from some rich Spanish prizes, which we hope to see
     in some of our ports."--(_Times, March 10, 1797._)

     "A very serious inconvenience has occurred to many people, from
     the multiplicity of forgeries in the stamps on the dollars,
     which, from being issued by the Bank, at a price so far above
     their real value, has tempted the coiners to forge the Mint
     Stamp, which it is impossible for a common observer to detect.
     Since their first issue, many chests of dollars have been
     imported into this country, for the sole purpose of forging the
     stamp. As they are circulated at 4s. 9d., and their value is only
     4s. 2d., it has afforded too great a temptation to be resisted.
     Besides the vast number of copper dollars coined, it is supposed
     that more than half of those in circulation, are counterfeited in
     the stamp, though the dollars are good. When taken to the Bank
     they are refused, which has caused a deal of ill
     humour."--(_Times, Sept. 4, 1797._)

     "The Dollars having been taken out of circulation, there is now

Up to this time forgeries of Bank of England notes had been very rare.

     "Last week a man was apprehended at Manchester, on a charge of
     forging Bank of England notes. On searching his house, was found
     a plate, with a one pound note engraved, on one side of it, and a
     two pound note, on the other; together with a number of notes
     just struck off, but not filled up. On his examination he
     confessed the fact, and thereby impeached his brother, who, he
     said, was then in Yorkshire: and acknowledged that they had
     practised it about six months, during which time they had
     disposed of about 200."--(_Times, March 30, 1798._)

     "A small delivery of Mr. Boulton's 2d. pieces, was, on Friday,
     made at the Treasury; the likeness of the King is much better
     executed than in the 1d. pieces: they are full twice their
     thickness, weighing rather better than two ounces
     each."--(_Times, Feby. 12, 1798._)

     "The trade of counterfeit halfpence, though it got a temporary
     check within the last five weeks, is again getting forward. The
     turnpike men, coffee-house waiters, haberdashers' shops, fruit
     women, and porter houses, are at their old work. The turnpike men
     will give bad, but not take them at present. If the traveller
     objects, he is abused and kept waiting, perhaps ten minutes, for
     change of 6d.: the coffee-house waiters say they have no others,
     and that they give and take; the haberdashers fold the change up
     in a clean bit of paper, which when opened, contains the worst of
     counterfeit halfpence: and the fruit women and porter houses say
     'they give what they take.'"--(_Times, Oct. 2, 1794._)

     "Bad shillings are sold to chandlers shops, turnpike men, and

     shillings_ for _five and sixpence_. No wonder they are in such
     general circulation."--(_Times, Nov. 29, 1794._)

     "At this season the Jew fruitmen should be particularly guarded
     against. They care not at how small a price they sell, so the
     quantum reaches to _silver_. In that case it is their custom 'to
     hope you will give them good silver, as the gardeners are very
     particular.' They then rub it with both thumbs, dexterously
     contriving to fillip up your shilling, and drop down another,
     which they beg you to change, protesting that they believed it
     good but are not certain. Serving you the same a second or third
     time, and you are induced through an appearance of great
     civility, and apparent ignorance, to indulge them. The silver you
     receive as your own is speciously good: but it changes black in a
     few hours. The writer of this bought his experience at the price
     of three succeeding shillings."--(_Times, July, 30, 1795._)

     "FALSE COINAGE.

     "The numerous evils arising from the now general circulation of
     Base Money, are too well known, to make it necessary that they
     should be dwelt on by us. We have always considered the different
     Administrations of this Country, as highly blameable for not
     paying more attention, than they have done, to prevent the
     nefarious practices which are introduced in the introduction of
     almost every species of Counterfeit Coin into the circulation of
     the country, because it certainly has the means in its own power,
     of lessening the mischief, by issuing a new coinage, particularly
     of Halfpence, which are, now, so generally bad, and so
     profligately circulated, that scarce a good halfpenny is to be
     seen.... The vast increase, and the extensive circulation, of
     base Money, particularly of late years, ... almost exceeds
     credibility, and the dexterity, and ingenuity, of these criminal
     people have enabled them to finish the different kinds of
     counterfeit Money, in so masterly a manner, that it has become
     extremely difficult, for the common observer, to distinguish the
     base Coin, now in circulation, from the worn out Silver, from the
     Mint. And, so systematic has this nefarious traffic become, that
     the great dealers, who in most instances are the employers of the
     Coiners, execute orders for the Town, and Country, with the same
     regularity as other manufacturers in fair branches of trade.
     Scarce a waggon, or coach, departs from the metropolis, that does
     not carry boxes, and parcels, of base coin, to the camps,
     seaports, and manufacturing towns, insomuch, that the country is
     deluged with counterfeit Money. In London, regular markets, in
     various public, and private, houses, are held by the principal
     Dealers, where Hawkers, Pedlars, fraudulent Horse-dealers,
     Unlicensed Lottery Office Keepers, Gamblers at Fairs, Itinerant
     Jews, Irish Labourers, Servants of Toll Gatherers, and
     Hackney-Coach Owners, fraudulent Publicans, Market Women, Rabbit
     Sellers, Fish Cryers, Barrow Women, and many who would not be
     suspected, are regularly supplied with counterfeit Copper, and
     Silver, with the advantages of nearly 100 per cent. in their
     favour: and thus it happens, that through these various channels,
     immense quantities of base Money get into circulation, while an
     evident diminution of the Mint Coinage, is apparent to every
     common observer.... Discoveries have been recently made, of no
     less than 120 persons, in the metropolis, and the country, who
     are employed, principally, in coining, and selling, Base Money:
     and this, independent of the numerous horde of utterers, who
     chiefly support themselves by passing it at its full value.

     "It will scarcely be credited, that of these criminal people who
     have either been detected, prosecuted, or convicted, within the
     last seven years, there stand upon the register of the Solicitor
     of the Mint, no less than 608 names! and yet the evil increases
     rapidly. And when it is known, that two persons can finish from
     £200, to £300, in base silver, _in six days_, and that three
     people, within the same period will stamp the like amount, in
     Copper, and when the number of known coiners are taken into the
     calculation, the aggregate in the course of the year must be
     immense!"--(_Times, Oct. 5, 1796._)




LAW AND POLICE.


In treating the above heading, I have no wish to introduce the
"Newgate Calendar" element into this book. Let those who like such
literature, consult that work--and, doubtless, they will be rewarded
for their pains; but, in going through these old papers, much that is
curious is met with, which throws light on the manners, and customs,
of our forefathers.

Of Police, as we understand the word, there was none--and the
parochial Constables, and watchmen, who were supposed to guard the
premises of the rate payers, and to keep the peace, were veritably of
the Dogberry and Verges type--utterly useless for the detection, or
suppression, of crime, and only fit to "comprehend all vagrom man," or
lead some roysterer home.

All day long they were not; but, at night, they came out with the
bats, and owls, armed with a long staff, and a lantern, periodically
droning out the hour of the night, and the state of the weather. This
was done with the laudable intention of shewing their vigilance, but
it must equally have acted in an opposite direction, for every thief
must have had due warning of the watchman's whereabouts. They had
temporary shelters, larger than the Military Sentry box, and the wild
spirits of those days delighted to catch a watchman napping, and
overturn his box, thus temporarily incapacitating him from giving an
alarm, or following their flight. For the former purpose they used
huge rattles, smaller specimens of which were carried, for the same
purpose, by our own Metropolitan Police, until 1884.

Each parish looked after its own interests, had its own watch and
ward, and was mightily jealous of interference from another parish--an
arrangement evidently very much to the advantage of a thief. People
were always grumbling--but the state of things was never altered. Hear
what they said about it in 1788:--

     "The Decrepid old Dotards, to whose vigilance the different
     Vestries have confined their fellow Citizens, are likely to
     profit from the order of nature being reversed by the life of our
     modern nobility, who, rising at _two_, dining at _eight_, and
     paying afternoon visits at _midnight_, have superseded the
     necessity of having watchmen, and are, in fact, with their
     servants, a much better patrole than any of the Bow Street
     Justices could furnish."--(_Morning Post, April 21, 1788._)

There were amateur thief catchers like Jonathan Wild, men who would be
the companions, and confederates, of Highwaymen, Housebreakers, and
Thieves, drawing Money from them until they were sucked dry, and then
sacrifice them without an atom of remorse.

And there were the detectives of that time, the Bow Street Runners, or
Robin Red breasts as they were called, from their wearing red
waistcoats. Peter Pindar sang of them, especially of the three that
were detailed for the protection of the Royal family at the time of
the French Revolution.

  ".   .   .   .   .   .   .   .   .   .   .   .
  What a bright thought in George and Charlotte,
  Who to escape each wicked Varlet,
    And disappoint Tom Paine's disloyal crew,
  Fixed on _Macmanus_, _Townsend_, _Jealous_,
  Delightful company, delicious fellows,
    To point out, every minute, who is who!
  To hustle from before their noble graces,
  Rascals with ill looks, designing faces,
    Where treason, murder, and sedition dwell;
  To give the life of every Newgate wretch,
  To say who next the fatal cord shall stretch,
    The sweet historian of the pensive cell."

[Illustration: Seen home by the Watch.--1792.]

Townsend, was undoubtedly the sharpest of the three, but he was a
pushing, boastful fellow, and never hid his light under a bushel. He
was, however, courageous, and never heeded where he went, or what odds
were opposed to him; so that the criminal classes began to respect
him, and, at last, never thought of opposing him. He was extremely
natty in his dress, and his flaxen wig was as well known, as his short
stout figure, and his red face--

  "Of all the wigs in Brighton Town,
  The black, the gray, the red, the brown,
  So firmly glued upon the crown,
    There's none like Johnny Townsend's;
  It's silken hair, and flaxen hue,
  It is a scratch, and not a queue,
  When e'er it pops upon the view,
    Is known for Johnny Townsend's."

It was by his means, that the famous pickpocket, Barrington, was
convicted, and transported, a fact which was very much to Barrington's
advantage, for he helped to put down a mutiny on board, whilst on his
passage out, for which he was well rewarded, and, by his good conduct,
he rose from step to step, always in the Colonial police--until he
died Chief of the Constabulary in New South Wales.

The laws were then frightfully severe in their punishments, but this
severity did not act as a deterrent to crime. The punishment of death,
(and hanging was the punishment for many trivial crimes) seems to have
had no terror--for we read in the _Morning Post_, July 11th 1788, "The
number of Capital Convicts at present in Newgate is eighty-one!" Of
course, these were not all executed, some having their sentences
commuted to transportation for life. Let us take a few cases from one
Newspaper only, the _Morning Post_, September 11, 1788. It was the
Sessions at the Old Bailey, 9th September:--

     "_John Dancer_, was put to the bar, and tried before Judge Grose,
     for a burglary, and robbery, in the empty dwelling-house of
     Daniel Dancer,[15] a farmer, near Uxbridge. This offence is made
     capital by the 39th Elizabeth. The jury brought in a verdict,
     _guilty_, of the value of £5.--_Death._

          [Footnote 15: The celebrated Miser. During the last 20 years
          of his life, his house is said to have been entered, by
          thieves, no less than fourteen times--and the amount of his
          losses, is calculated at £2,500.]

     "_John Crawford_, for a burglary in the house of Francis Bias.
     The crime being fully proved.--_Guilty_--_Death_.

     "_William Johnson_, for a burglary and robbery of poultry, in the
     dwelling house of Margaret Allen, at
     Hampstead.--_Guilty_--_Death_.

     "_Thomas Jones_, for a highway robbery of a watch &c. He was
     taken in the _manier_--_i.e._ with the watch upon
     him.--_Guilty_--_Death_.

     "Several other prisoners were tried and acquitted for various
     offences, particularly one for a rape--_his crime was only_
     Seduction!"

       *       *       *       *       *

     "Monday evening, as a lady was passing along Long-Acre, she was
     jostled into a Court by a number of those abandoned wretches, who
     to the disgrace of our police and magistrates, infest every
     corner of the Metropolis, where they stripped her of her cloak,
     bonnet, and of almost everything she had on, besides grossly
     insulting her. The Public Offices of Justice are every morning
     full of these women of the town, who have been taken up for their
     disorderly behaviour. But, while the connection between them and
     the Watchmen subsists, the evil must still remain. It is an evil
     of the most serious and alarming nature, and peculiarly calls for
     the interposition of the Legislature."--(_Morning Post, Sept. 26,
     1788._)

       *       *       *       *       *

     "There are at this time, in Newgate, upwards of Seven Hundred
     prisoners, the greatest number ever known to be in that place of
     confinement, at the same time."--(_Morning Post, Dec. 5, 1788._)

       *       *       *       *       *

     "Kelly who was pilloried at Reading, brings actions against those
     who pelted him. This is a new cause of trial, but clearly a legal
     one."--(_Morning Post, Dec. 23, 1789._)

Here, they evidently "caught a Tartar." The pelting could have been no
part of the man's sentence--but what was the issue of his appeal to
law, I know not.

About the year 1790, occurs a most singular police episode, so
singular, and so comparatively unknown, that I cannot refrain from
somewhat enlarging upon it.

In the early spring of 1790, murmurs began to be heard of ladies being
attacked, and stabbed, by a monster in human form. The murmurs were
low at first, and "monster" was printed with a small "m;" but, very
shortly, they grew into a roar, and no capitals were found too large
for THE MONSTER.

Indeed, even before that, and as far back as May, 1788, a Mrs. Smith
had been stabbed in the upper part of her thigh by a man in Fleet
Street, and was even followed by him to a house in Johnson's Court, to
which she was going, and watched by him until she was let in. In May,
1789, a Mrs. Godfrey was similarly stabbed in Boswell Court, Fleet
Street; and another lady was left wounded at her door. In March, 1790,
a Mrs. Blaney, of Bury Street, was stabbed at her door after she had
knocked. Dr. Smith, seeing an account of this outrage in a newspaper,
inserted a notice in the _Morning Herald_, and that journal, having
made some severe remarks on the matter, public opinion began to be
awakened, and numerous letters were written, on the subject, to the
newspapers of the day. The thing began to be talked of in the higher
circles. A young lady named Porter had been stabbed whilst, in the
company of her sisters, returning from the Drawing Room at St.
James's, on the 18th of January, the Queen's Birthday; and since that
time, several people had been wounded by this miscreant, who,
fortunately, always failed in doing serious injury to his victims.

Mr. John Julius Angerstein (whose name will ever be associated with
the commencement of our National Gallery) was very active, and
inaugurated a subscription at Lloyd's, to which the guineas flowed
merrily, for the capture, and conviction of the "Monster." The police
began to bestir themselves, and they, too, issued placards. One will
serve as a type of all:--

                                 "Public Office, Bow Street,
                                 _Thursday, April 29, 1790_.

     "One Hundred Pounds Reward.

     "Several ladies having, of late, been inhumanly cut, and maimed,
     by a person answering the following description, whoever will
     apprehend him, or give such information to Sir Sampson Wright, at
     the above office, as may be the means of his being apprehended,
     shall immediately upon his committal to prison, receive fifty
     pounds from Mr. Angerstein of Pall Mall, and the further sum of
     fifty pounds upon his conviction. _N.B._--He appears to be about
     thirty years of age, of a middle size, rather thin make, a little
     pockmarked, of a pale complexion, large nose; light brown hair,
     tied in a queue, cut short and frizzed low at the sides; is
     sometimes dressed in black, and sometimes in a shabby blue coat;
     sometimes wears straw-coloured breeches, with half boots, laced
     up before: sometimes wears a cocked hat, and at other times a
     round hat, with a very high top, and generally carries a Wangee
     cane in his hand.

     "All servants are recommended to take notice that if any man has
     stayed at home without apparent cause, within these few days,
     during the daylight. All washerwomen and servants should take
     notice of any blood on a man's handkerchief, or linen, as the
     wretch generally fetches blood when he strikes. All servants
     should examine if any man carries sharp weapons about him, and if
     there is any blood thereon, particularly tucks; and maid-servants
     are to be told that a tuck is generally at the head of a stick,
     which comes out by a sudden jerk. All cutlers are desired to
     watch if any man answering the above description is desirous of
     having his weapon of attack very sharp."

[Illustration: The MONSTER cutting a lady.--1790.]

All baker's men were asked to give notice at every house they called
at, of the above reward, and Mr. Angerstein promised twenty pounds to
any man by whose instrumentality the Monster was discovered.

Additional publicity was, moreover, given by other means. The _Morning
Herald_ of April 27th says:

"A new musical piece was produced last night at Astley's called The
Monster, and being brought forward at a time when the attention of all
London was engaged in discovering him, cannot fail of producing full
houses. Astley seems to have taken up the matter very seriously, as
the piece abounds with much satire against the Monster. The songs also
are well adapted: the chorus of one concluding as follows,

  'When the Monster is taken in the fact
  We'll have him tried by the Coventry Act,[16]
                The Black Act
                The Coventry Act,'

produced unbounded applause. This piece will certainly be a good
acquisition to Astley, who is said to be the author."

          [Footnote 16: This Act, against cutting and maiming, owed
          its name to Sir John Coventry, who, in Charles the Second's
          time, was favourable to a motion, in the House of Commons,
          to impose a tax on play-houses, which was opposed by the
          Court. Sir John Birkenhead having remarked that the players
          were the King's servants, and a part of his pleasure, Sir J.
          Coventry asked "Whether the King's pleasure lie among the
          men, or the women, that acted?" This was neither forgotten
          nor forgiven, and Sir John was set upon whilst walking home,
          by some ruffians. He defended himself desperately, and
          wounded some of his assailants, but was overpowered, and his
          nose slit to the bone, "for reflecting on the King." This
          outrage excited great indignation at the time.]

One lady (Mrs. R. Walpole) was fortunate enough to escape being
wounded, owing to her having an apple in her pocket: an incident which
gave rise to some poetic effusions:

  "Eve, for an apple, lost immortal life:
  From you an apple turn'd the Monster's knife!
  Can greater proof, since Eve, be given
      Of diabolic strife,
          Or interposing Heaven?"

  "The apple was, in days of yore,
  An Agent to the Devil,
  When Eve was tempted to explore
  The sense of good and evil;
  But present chronicles can give
  An instance quite uncommon,
  How that which ruined Mother Eve
  Hath saved a Modern Woman."

The Monster was even made a party to Anti-slavery agitation, for at
the Westminster Forum in Panton Street, Haymarket, "by desire of
several ladies," was debated the question: "Which is the greater
disgrace to humanity, the ruffian who drags the female African from
her family, her kindred, and her native country, or the Monster who
has lately wounded, or terrified, many ladies in this metropolis?" The
result of this discussion is not handed down to posterity.

Still the Monster kept steadily at his work, and almost every day
brought its tale of some woman being stabbed: and, one being injured
in St. Pancras Parish, a meeting of the inhabitants was called at the
Percy Coffee House, on May 7th, and an association was formed "to
nightly patrol the streets of the south division of Saint Pancras,
from half-an-hour before sunset, till eleven at night, for the public
safety, and especially to guard that sex which a Monster, or Monsters,
in opposition to the dictates of nature, and humanity, have dared to
assault, and wound, with wanton, and savage, cruelty."

The idea that these outrages were not done single-handed, was on the
increase, and the indefatigable Mr. Angerstein again issued a placard,
and "informs the public, that from information he has received of the
person who, since Friday last, has assaulted and wounded several
women, there is great reason to fear that more than one of these
wretches infests the streets: it is therefore thought necessary to
give the following description of one, who, within this week, has
committed many acts of cruelty upon women," and gives four
descriptions of the man's dress, which would lead to the inference
that the Monster was in possession of a very extensive wardrobe.

People were now gradually getting into a state of ferment, and the
Monster was the engrossing topic of public interest. Of course, then
as now, the wrong people were arrested occasionally. One "Walter Hill,
was brought before the Magistrate at Litchfield Street on suspicion of
being one of the wretches who have cut several women; he was
apprehended in Windmill Street, Tottenham Court Road, near the place
where two women were cut, though Miss Porter, and several other
ladies, declared the prisoner was not the person who wounded them."
Nothing could be proved against him, and, ultimately, he was
discharged.

Even the light-fingered fraternity entered into the spirit of the
times, for _The World_ of May 11th has--"Public Office, Bow St.,
before Sir Sampson Wright. Yesterday evening, about half after seven
o'clock, a gentleman of family and fortune, was surrounded in Holborn
by a number of pickpockets, who, after hustling him, and robbing him
of his watch, money, and hat, called out: 'That is the Monster, he has
just cut a woman.' A vast number of people immediately pursued the
gentleman, some calling 'The Monster!' others, 'Stop thief,' till at
length he was knocked down, and surrounded by near a thousand people,
by whom he was very ill-treated, and, probably, would not have escaped
with life, had he not been, by some gentleman, taken into Gray's Inn
Coffee House; from whence he was conveyed to the Brown Bear, in Bow
Street, in a hackney-coach; where the mob were so exasperated that
they broke the windows of the house, and, could they have got at him,
would, no doubt, have massacred him: by stratagem he was, at nine
o'clock, brought to this office. When the above facts appeared, Sir
Sampson Wright lamented that it was not in his power to punish the
perpetrators of this daring, and alarming, assault, but did all he
could, by giving that gentleman his protection until the mob
dispersed."

Accounts of mock assaults were written to the papers, one of them
extremely circumstantial, telling how a courageous lady drew a pistol
"from her pocket and discharged it into the wretch's neck, immediately
under the ear, who instantly left her, uttering the most dreadful
imprecations." This, it is needless to say, was denied, and exposed
next morning.

Imposture, of course, took advantage of such a golden opportunity, and
we find that "the account which appeared in all the newspapers of Miss
B. of Marylebone Street, having been twice wounded by the Monster,
proves to be a fabrication, for the purpose of exciting compassion,
and money, and has, in some degree, answered the purpose. The above
discovery has been made, by an investigation of this business, by the
Select Vestry of Marylebone Parish. This is a new kind of Monster!"

The _Oracle_ of May 17th tells the following little story:--"Tuesday,
about nine o'clock, as Mr. Heather was crossing Tower Hill, he
observed a well-dressed woman upon the ground: when he went to her,
she said a very tall man had just wounded her with some sharp
instrument, and begged his assistance to get to the Minories to a
coach, which he readily complied with, upon observing blood in several
places upon her gown and apron. However, the coach had not been gone
ten minutes, before he found she had picked his pocket of his watch,
and about three guineas."

Although there was now a cessation of real attacks by the Monster, the
public feeling rose to very fever height. As one newspaper remarked:
"The Monster is now a mischief of more than common magnitude. Inhuman
himself, the villainy is visited upon all who are of the same sex:
alike the source of apprehension, terror, and flight. It is really
distressing to walk our streets towards evening. Every woman we meet
regards us with distrust, shrinks sidling from our touch, and expects
a poignard to pierce what gallantry, and manhood, consider as sacred.
There must be a very criminal supineness somewhere, or these execrable
villains would, with greater speed, expiate with their lives, the
insulted humanity of being."

As an example of the pitch to which the excitement was wrought, the
following case may be taken. A man met a girl, and went with her into
a public-house. They sat down, and he showed her an artificial
bouquet, or nosegay, as it was then called, which he had in his hand,
and begged her to accept it. The girl, in taking hold of it, felt
something prick her, and it made her hand bleed. She went away, and
told the story to some of her friends, who immediately insisted that
it must be the Monster, and that a dagger was certainly concealed in
the nosegay. The man was in consequence arrested, and kept all night
in the watch-house. On enquiry in the morning, it was found that the
girl's hand had only been pricked by the wire used to bind the flowers
together, and the poor man was, of course, discharged.

But Nemesis was at hand. One of his victims--that Miss Porter, who was
stabbed after the Drawing Room, on the Queen's birthday--was walking
with Mr. John Coleman, in St. James's Park, on Sunday, June 13th, and
the Monster passed her. She at once recognised him, and, her agitation
being remarked by Mr. Coleman, she said, "There is the wretch who
wounded me." Mr. Coleman left her in charge of her friends, and
followed the man, who walked very fast--evidently feeling he had been
noticed, and endeavoured to dodge about from Spring Gardens, to
Admiralty Passage, back again to Spring Gardens, and up Cockspur
Street, to Pall Mall: thence to St. James's Street, and Bolton Street,
where he knocked at the door of a house, and was let in. He stayed
there about five minutes, and then went to Piccadilly, and St. James's
Street, where he knocked at another house, and asked the servant some
question. Leaving there, he went to Bond Street, Mr. Coleman
endeavouring to insult him, by walking before and behind him, and
staring him in the face. He then went to Oxford Street--then called
Oxford Road--and Vere Street, where he knocked at an empty house.
Then Mr. Coleman spoke to him, and asked him what was the use of
knocking so violently at a house palpably empty; and he replied that
he knew the people of the house, named Pearce, and knocked again for
three or four minutes. He then crossed to South Molton Street, knocked
at a house, and was admitted. Mr. Coleman asked the master of the
house, Mr. Smith, for information as to the man, but he refused to
give any, unless some reason was assigned. Mr. Coleman replied that
the other had insulted some ladies under his protection, and that he
demanded satisfaction. The Monster offered to meet him at any
coffee-house, and gave his address as Fifty-two Jermyn Street. Mr.
Coleman then let him go, but upon second thoughts hurried back, and
again met him in St. James's Street; and looking at him, told him he
did not think he was what he described himself, and asked him to come
with him to Mr. Porter's house, which was not far off. He consented,
and on seeing him, two of the Miss Porters immediately fainted, but
upon recovery unhesitatingly declared him to be "the wretch." He
turned to Mr. Coleman and asked: "Do the ladies suspect me to be the
person advertised? Am I suspected?"

He was given into custody, and on the 15th of June, the newspapers
gave full accounts of his capture and examination.

He proved to be a native of Wales, named Renwick (or Rhynwick)
Williams, aged about twenty-three, who was sent young to London, where
he was bound apprentice to Sir John Gallini, with a view to his
becoming a dancer on the stage. A misunderstanding, as to the
disappearance of a watch, severed this connection, and he then led a
very loose life. For some little time, about two months, he was a
lawyer's clerk, but this employment being only temporary, he was
reduced to difficulties, until he met with Mr. Aimable Michell, of
Dover Street, who taught him artificial-flower making, and with whom
he remained until his arrest.

He was dressed very respectably, in a blue coat, lined, and edged,
with buff, buff waistcoat, and black satin breeches.

He was fully identified by the Misses Porter, Miss Frost, Miss
Baughan, and Mrs. Franklin, whilst numerous ladies who had been
wounded could not identify him. He was of course, remanded. Royalty,
in the person of the Duke of Cumberland (afterwards King of Hanover),
was present at his examination, and great difficulty was experienced
in preserving the prisoner from the fury of the exasperated mob.

On the 16th of June he was again brought up, was identified by two
more ladies, and confronted with others, who could not be sure he was
the man who had wounded them. The Dukes of York, and Cumberland, and
Prince William of Gloucester, besides several peers, were present.

He was brought before the magistrates once more, when another lady
identified him, and he was committed for trial.

[Illustration: Renwick Williams.--1790.]

Owing to the novelty of the crime, great difficulty was experienced as
to his indictment, but it was at last settled that he should be tried
under the statute 6th Geo. I. c. 23, s. 11, which made it felony,
punishable with transportation, for seven years, to assault any person
in the public streets, with intent to tear, spoil, cut, burn, or
deface, the garments, or clothes, of such person, or persons, provided
the act be done in pursuance of such intention.

On Thursday, the 8th of July, Williams was tried at the Old Bailey,
before Mr. Justice Buller, charged with making an assault upon Ann
Frost, spinster, on the 9th of November last, in Jermyn Street, St.
James's, and wickedly, wilfully, and maliciously, tearing, and
spoiling, her garments, to wit, the gown, petticoats, and shift, of
the said Ann, against the statute in that case provided.

He was also indicted for the commission of a similar offence in
Holborn, on the 5th of May, on Sarah, the wife of John Davis. The same
on Sarah, the wife of John Godfrey, on the 13th of May, in St.
Marylebone. The 26th of September, on Mary Forster, in Maxwell Street.
The 6th of December, on Elizabeth Baughan, in Parliament Street. For a
like act, on the same day, in the same street, on Frances Baughan. For
a like act, on Ann Porter, on the 18th of January, in St. James's
Street.

He pleaded not guilty, and was defended by counsel. The case of Miss
Porter was then gone into, and the evidence, as already detailed, was
adduced. For the defence, he called his master, Mr. Michell, who swore
that he was at work till twelve, on the night of the 18th of January,
and did not quit his house till after supper at half-past twelve,
which was also substantiated by the witness of his sister, Miss
Michell, Catherine, and Molly Harmond, and two of the workwomen,
besides a customer: and ten witnesses were called as to character. The
judge summed up very favourably for the prisoner, but the jury,
without hesitation, found him guilty. The judge said, as this was a
new case, and he had some doubts as to the indictment, he would
respite judgment until he had laid the case before the twelve judges.
So this, and the other indictments, were put off until the December
Sessions.

There were many accounts of the trial, and numerous portraits were
published of Williams, who was by no means bad-looking, thin and pale,
with powdered hair "en queue."

The caricaturists took the matter up, and treated the matter as a
joke, recommending ladies to have copper petticoats, &c.

But the most awful picture is that of "The Monster going to take his
afternoon luncheon," where he is depicted as a terrible being about to
devour a pretty girl--but the caricaturist shows us, kindly, "the
Monster disappointed of his afternoon luncheon," in which engraving,
he has a double shot--one at the somewhat delicate subject of the
"dress improver" of the day, and the other, how this fashion might be
utilised to baffle the Monster of his intended meal.

There was the usual newspaper correspondents' wrangle, in which, of
course, it was unpopular to advance any argument in favour of the
Monster. Indeed, _The World_, of October 16th, says: "Writing a
defence of the Monster carries with it more serious consequences than
people are at first aware of, because it would appear as if publishing
accounts, in the newspapers, or otherwise, could really justify
atrocious acts. As Junius has said: 'The people at large are never
mistaken in their sentiments, and, if they have formed an opinion,
there is no taking them out of it by misrepresentation.'" That there
was an opinion in his favour is not only evidenced by this, but at the
City Debates, Capel Court, Bartholomew Lane, the question was debated
on July 12: "Did the late extraordinary conduct ascribed to Renwick
Williams (commonly called the Monster) originate in an unfortunate
insanity, a diabolical inclination to injure the fair part of the
creation, or the groundless apprehension of some mistaken females?"

[Illustration: Protection from the MONSTER.]

But the man kept up the feeling against him, by his own conduct, and
could not be quiet in prison. _The Oracle_, of August the 20th, has
the following account of "The Monster's Ball":--"The depravity of the
times was manifested last week, in an eminent degree, in Newgate. The
Monster sent cards of invitation to about twenty couple, among whom
were some of his alibi friends, his brother, sisters, several of the
prisoners, and others, whom we shall take a future opportunity to
notice.

"At four o'clock the party sat to tea; this being over, two violins
struck up, accompanied by a flute, and the company proceeded to
exercise their limbs. In the merry dance, the cuts, and entrechats, of
the Monster were much admired, and his adroitness in that amusement
must be interesting, from the school in which he acquired this branch
of his accomplishments.

"About eight o'clock the company partook of a cold supper, and a
variety of wines, such as would not discredit the most sumptuous gala,
and about nine o'clock departed, that being the usual hour for
locking the doors of the prison."

Williams gradually faded away from public notice until early in
November, when eleven of the judges met in Serjeants' Inn Hall, and
consulted on his case, which had been reserved. The questions were:
First, whether his having an intention to cut the person of Miss
Porter, and, in carrying that intention into execution, cutting the
garments of that lady, is an offence within the statute of 6th Geo. I.
c. 23, s. 11, on which he was convicted; the jury having, in their
verdict, found that in cutting her person he had thereby an intention
to cut her garments? Secondly, whether the statute being in the
conjunctive, "that if any person shall assault with an intent to cut
the garment of such person, then the offender shall be guilty of
felony," and the indictment, in stating the intention, not having
connected it with the act by inserting the words that he "then and
there" did cut her garment, could be supported in point of form?

Nine out of the eleven judges were of opinion that the offence,
notwithstanding the finding of the jury, was not within the statute,
and that the indictment was bad in point of law.

This decision reduced the Monster's crime to a misdemeanour.

On Monday, December 13th, he was brought to trial at the Sessions
House, Clerkenwell Green, and, as a proof of the interest it created,
even the names of the jury are recorded. The trial began at ten, A.M.,
and was inaugurated by the prisoner reading a paper declaring his
innocence. He was indicted for assaulting Miss Porter, with intent to
kill, and murder her: there was a second count which stated, that he,
"holding a knife in his right hand, did wilfully give the said Ann
Porter a dreadful wound, of great length and depth on the right thigh
and hip; to wit, of the length of nine inches, and the depth of four."
A third count charged him with a common assault. The evidence was
similar to that in the former trial, and, after a trial, lasting
thirteen hours, he was found guilty.

He was afterwards found guilty of other assaults, and was finally
sentenced to two years' imprisonment in Newgate, for each assault on
Miss Porter, Elizabeth Davis, and Miss E. Baughan, and at the end of
the six years, he was to find bail for good behaviour for seven years,
himself in the sum of two hundred pounds, and two sureties in one
hundred pounds each.

What finally became of him is not known. Mr. Angerstein offered the
reward to Miss Porter, as it was by her instrumentality that the
Monster was captured, but she refused it.

The recollection of _the Monster_, did not quickly fade away, for we
read in the _Times_, 20 Dec. 1799, "Another new _Monster_ on
Wednesday, made his appearance in town. His passion is for _biting_
the Ladies' _toes_ and _finger ends_. They say his name is _Frost_."

Food riots, the natural outcome of an almost starving and ignorant
population were rife; but, in the following paragraph, there is a
curious allusion, that _the grain was intended to be shipped to
France_, with which nation we were then at war.

     "Several towns in Cornwall were last week visited by large bodies
     of Miners, from the different works, in search of concealed corn,
     which they insist upon is intended for exportation to France. At
     Wadebridge, they found about 25,000 bushels in store, which they
     obliged the Owners to sell at reduced prices. At Looe upwards of
     6000 bushels of grain were stopped by them from being shipped,
     but we do not hear of their committing any other outrage. Part of
     the first regiment of dragoons is gone from Devonshire, to assist
     the magistrates in restoring peace."--(_Times, Feb. 6, 1793._)

Highway robberies were of daily occurrence, so much so, that they are
not worth chronicling, unless some special circumstance occurs in
connection with them.

     "The pickpockets are all turned highwaymen. Thus far the
     metropolis has been delivered from these free-booters: and the
     relief is certainly owing to the new Police Bill."--(_Times,
     March 9, 1793._)

       *       *       *       *       *

     "At Oxford, a person was convicted of having robbed the Worcester
     and Oxford Coach, near Woodstock, of a portmanteau, and this
     peculiar circumstance attended it:--The man committed the
     offence, was taken, indicted, tried, and convicted, within
     _twelve_ hours after the commission of the crime. He was indicted
     for petty larceny only."--(_Times, March 28, 1793._)

       *       *       *       *       *

     "Mr. Burdon, the Member for the County of Durham, had 25,000
     guineas in his chaise when he was stopped, the other evening by
     footpads, who robbed him of 25 guineas only. Mr. Burdon was
     carrying down this sum, for the relief of the Durham
     Bank."--(_Times, April 26, 1793._)

A shocking trade had sprung up, which was not long in developing. As
Science grew, so was a knowledge of Anatomy becoming of more vital
importance to the medical profession--but subjects for operation were
scarce. True, those malefactors who were hanged, and had no friends,
were given over to the Surgeons for dissection, but this means of
supply, fell far short of the demand--which, however, was met, by the
ghastly device of robbing the grave-yards of their newly buried dead.
Here are some contemporary records of the doings of these ghouls:--

     "Friday, a gang of persons, called _Resurrection men_, were
     apprehended between two, and three, o'clock in the morning, near
     the Churchyard at Hampstead; they had dug up the body of a Mr.
     John Lloyd, who had been buried the day before, put it into a
     sack, and a hackney-coach was waiting to receive it; but, by the
     vigilance, and resolution, of the watchmen, they lost their prey;
     for, having stopt the coach, they found the body in it, and two
     men, whose names are Tom Paine, and Peter Mackintosh, together
     with their shovels, and tools, for opening the coffin. They were
     both carried before Master Montague, together with John Peach,
     the driver of the Coach, and were committed to gaol upon the
     fullest evidence. There were two others of the party, who made
     their escape. One of them had the appearance of a Gentleman, and
     is supposed to be a surgeon."--(_Times, March 15, 1794._)

       *       *       *       *       *

     "On Monday evening, a set of Resurrectionists, were apprehended
     at a house near the Turnpike, Mile end. That morning, a coach was
     observed to stop at this house, and an ill looking man came out
     of it with a sack; containing as it was supposed, a body, which
     he carried into the house, and returned immediately with a large
     hamper:--they then drove off to a neighbouring public-house,
     when, after a short stay, they took up some others, and were
     traced to the Launch, at Deptford. In the meantime, the parish
     officers were informed of the circumstance. About six in the
     evening, the coach again returned with a similar lading, which
     was deposited in the house. Some constables, accompanied by a
     number of people, surrounded the house, and forcing an entrance,
     they found two men, and a woman, drinking tea on a bench, at one
     end of which lay the bodies of two children. They were secured:
     and, on entering an adjoining room, the bodies of six adults were
     discovered, unmutilated; besides which, the floor was strewed
     with limbs, in a state too shocking for public
     description."--(_Times, March 20, 1794._)

     "A very particular account has been sent to this Paper, of the
     late shocking discovery of dead bodies at Mile-End: but we deem
     it unfit for publication, as the circumstances are too horrid to
     meet the public eye. Every room in the house was a scene of the
     most shocking brutality, and it is supposed there were upwards of
     100 bodies, some whole, others mangled. The remains found at this
     house have since been removed to Bethnal Green church-yard, for a
     second interment. We most sincerely hope that his Grace the
     Archbishop of Canterbury will move for a bill in Parliament,
     making it _death_ to rob a church yard."--(_Times, March 22,

     who, upon the alarm being raised, made their escape; a reward of
     One hundred Pounds, for apprehending them, was immediately
     offered by the Churchwardens, to be paid upon their conviction:
     and the first opportunity was taken of assembling the
     Parishioners in Vestry, in order to consider by what means they
     might secure the offenders, bring them to punishment, and
     prevent, in future, such depredations. A Committee was
     accordingly appointed for this purpose, and discoveries of
     similar robberies in Church-yards, and Burial-grounds, in, and
     near, this Metropolis, have been made, the recital of which,
     together with an account of the horrid traffic in which many have
     been long engaged, with impunity, cannot fail to excite the
     indignation of the Public, and which it is intended, in a short
     time, to give them, taken from Affidavits made before
     Magistrates, and from other evidence procured on this melancholy
     occasion. It will be needless to say, that the Relatives, and
     Friends, of those who have been lately buried there, before this
     discovery, have suffered great anguish of mind, and it is not
     doubted but that all will concur in adopting measures, which may
     effectually check such abominable practices. For this desirable
     end, an application to Parliament, early in the next Session, is
     deemed highly necessary, as, at present, the punishment is found
     to be by no means sufficient to prevent the crime. The Parishes
     therefore, within the Bills of Mortality, and near London, will,
     it is hoped, approve of such application, and it is intended that
     a Circular Letter shall be sent to them, to invite them to join
     in it. In the meantime, the Committee of the Parish of Saint
     Mary, Lambeth, will be glad to receive any communications from
     any other Parishes, on this subject, under cover, directed to
     Thomas Swabey, Vestry Clerk, Lambeth."--(_Times, April 21,
     1794._)

     "Early on Tuesday Morning, some suspicion being entertained that
     the Pesthouse burial-ground, in Old-Street-Road, had been
     frequently violated, the parish watchmen were ordered to keep a
     good look out, when a hackney coach was observed, waiting near
     the spot. Upon the watchman's approaching it, he was assaulted,
     and beaten, by three men, who then made off: but afterwards,
     springing his rattle, the assistants took the coachman into
     custody, who had three sacks in his coach, two of them containing
     the body of a man each, and the other, three children. Several
     other bodies, which had been dug up for the purpose of carrying
     away, were found under the wall of the burying-ground: and, it is
     generally believed, that almost all the bodies deposited therein,
     for 5 weeks past, have been stolen, which, upon an average, must
     have been 15 per week. The hackney-coachman, who owned he was to
     have had ten guineas for his night's fare, was committed to the
     New Prison, Clerkenwell. This fellow, it should seem, was
     hardened to his business: for, though put into the cage with the
     bodies he was carrying off, he slept so sound, that it was with
     some difficulty he was awakened by the visit of a _brother-whip_,
     previous to his going before a Magistrate."--(_Times, Dec, 23,
     1796._)

Sentence of death was passed on Criminals for offences we should now
think totally inadequate to that punishment--but although sentenced,
those convicted of the lighter offences--were almost all respited, and
transported for life.

     "At the Assizes for York and County, the following prisoners
     received sentence of death, viz., T. Jewitt, for stealing four
     heifers: Saml. Bathurst, for privately stealing in a shop; Wm.
     Atkinson, and Hannah Hobson, for riotously assembling and pulling
     down the house of John Cooper, of Whitby: John Holt and Richard
     Watson, for house breaking, and three others for
     sheep-stealing."--(_Times, March 30, 1793._)

     "A petition from Wm. Brunskill, (commonly called _Jack Ketch_)
     was presented to the Court of Aldermen, stating that he was the
     public executioner, and, on that account, could not get any other
     employment: that he was obliged to keep an assistant, though his
     allowance was so small, and his income so trifling, as to be
     insufficient to maintain himself, and family, and praying
     relief.--The Court referred the same to the Sheriffs."--(_Times,
     Jan. 30, 1794._)

The next paragraph, which is very brief, tells its own story.

     "There is now a man confined for debt in Newgate, who has been a
     prisoner there, over fifteen years, for a debt, the original sum
     of which does not exceed forty-five shillings."--(_Times, April
     25, 1793._)

In Dec. 1794, and Jan. 1795, there was a terrible frost--and, in the
latter month, we hear that seven men, attempting to pass over the ice,
to a Collier, by Ratcliffe Highway--were drowned--and how--two days
afterwards--two watchmen were frozen to death at Bloomsbury. Hard
indeed must have been the lot of the poor debtors, and we may fancy
the anxious scrutiny of the box, which the debtor whose turn it was,
would rattle outside the bars of Ludgate, making the while his
monotonous, and melancholy, whine, "Pity the poor debtors; pity the
poor debtors." Some hearts were softened towards them, and they were
sensibly grateful for such seasonable assistance.

     "Advt.--The unfortunate DEBTORS in LUDGATE PRISON beg leave, thus
     publicly, to return their grateful Thanks to LADY TAYLOR, of
     Spring Gardens, for her munificent Benefaction of 149 lbs. of
     Beef, 21 half Peck Loaves, 21 sacks of Coals, and 66 lbs. of
     Cheese, each Article being of the best quality.

     "At the same time, they entreat the LORD MAYOR to accept their
     unfeigned Thanks, for his kind present of a Guinea, which was
     equally divided among the unfortunate Debtors.

     "_N.B._ The smallest Benefaction from their fellow Citizens and

     Lords, by introducing a clause which shall interdict the Marshal
     of the King's Bench, and the Warden of the Fleet, from taking a
     shilling per week from each debtor for his bed, unless as the
     very foundation, and cause of this fee originally was, that the
     Keeper of the Prison furnishes the Debtor with furniture to the
     amount of £30. The Keepers have very handsome salaries, and
     therefore, there should be no exactions from the prisoners.

     surrounded by a number of colliers, who conveyed them to a

     suffered to remain till about two the next morning, when they
     were had up, and, each having a glass of gin, and some
     gingerbread, given him, were immersed again into the dreary

     brought the lad to this office (Public Office, Bow St.) to shew
     one of the modes of punishment adopted by the master, when the
     boys committed any fault. It consisted of an iron collar,
     fastened round the neck, by a padlock. The lad said that he had
     worn it for above a month, and that he understood it was his
     master's intention he should wear it till he was out of his time.
     The master living in the county of Surrey, Mr Bond could not
     interfere in the business, but advised the parties to go to
     Union-Hall, in the Borough. The master of the apprentice alluded

     "Owing to the high price of victualling, the demand for shipping
     and risque of capture, or the price of insurance, the contract
     for conveying the last convicts from Great Britain, and Ireland,
     to Botany Bay, was £80 per man; and the expence exceeding all the
     good that could arise to either country, from the banishment, or
     the evil that could arise from the continuance in either country,
     of the miscreants.

     "It is a known fact, that so far are the miscreants, who usually
     come under sentence of transportation, from considering it a
     punishment, that they laugh at the joke, and consider it a very
     great benefit.--Adventurous spirits like those, averse to all
     manner of industry, insensible to ignominy, and totally
     unconscious of any such feelings as the _amor patriæ_, delight in
     nothing more, than shifting the scene, and being conveyed to a
     distant country, from that in which they have no hope of
     existing, but at the perpetual risk of the gallows.

     "It is more than probable that severe flagellation, such as
     military codes prescribe, would prove infinitely more formidable
     in detering villainy: and it is, at least, worth the experiment
     of a statute, which costs nothing, to try whether the penalty of
     500, or 1000 lashes, which would not cost the country one
     shilling, would not prove a stronger barrier against larcenies,
     and clergyable felonies, than transportation to Botany Bay, at
     the enormous expense of £60 or 80 per man, which operates in
     reality as a heavy penalty on the Republic of honest men, and a
     bounty on villainy. Besides, have we not copper mines, coal
     mines, canals, and other such places of employment, at home, for
     those criminals, which, at present, alienate the husbandmen, and
     honest labourers of the country, from the business of

of assaulting Ryan Thackars, on the 30th of December, and robbing him
of half a guinea, a 7s. piece, and 1s. 6d., in silver, his property.

"The Prosecutor was a Jew, and a common informer, in which character
he had gone, on the above mentioned day, to the Fleet Prison, to serve
the wife of Mr. Richards, with a notice to answer to an information
for wearing hair powder without a licence. On his serving the Notice,
Mr. Richards called him back, but he refusing to return, the other
assaulted him, threw him down upon his back, said he knew him very
well, that he was a damned informer, and that he should be pumped.
Then the two Prisoners dragged him to the pump, and, with the
assistance of others, kept pouring water upon him, for a quarter of an
hour. A pail of water was afterwards thrown, by somebody, on his face.
His clothes were all torn: and, when they let him go, he missed his
money. Being asked by the Court if he could charge the Prisoners with
having robbed him, he answered he could not; nor was the money found
on them when apprehended. The Recorder then told the Jury, that as no
charge was made out against the prisoners, they must acquit
them.--_Not Guilty._"

     "BASE COIN FINISHED AT NEWGATE.

     "A very singular circumstance occurred a few days ago at the gaol
     of Newgate: One of the Magistrates of Police having received
     information that a person of the name of _Pullen_, a notorious
     offender who was sentenced to a year's imprisonment for dealing
     in base money, had been carrying on his former trade, while in
     confinement: that the base money of the similitude of a shilling,
     being previously prepared of blanched copper, with King William's
     head faintly impressed on one side, and plain on the other, was
     brought into the prison privately by Agents whom he employed:
     that after the Cells were locked up, this adroit Coiner prepared
     a liquid in which very thin pieces of silver were mixed, which,
     being rubbed upon the Copper shillings, instantly give them the
     appearance of worn down coin of the Mint: that he was assisted in
     the operation by several of the prisoners in the same ward, some
     of whom were his associates in iniquity, and convicted of
     offences against the Mint Laws: That his customers came regularly
     to the prison, and purchased the base money so finished at _two_
     for _one_, paying sixpence for each shilling, although
     intrinsically not worth a halfpenny: that the dies, and some
     other implements for coining belonging to these delinquents, had
     been actually lodged in their trunks at Newgate, and they were
     brought there privately, on every alarm of danger from officers
     of justice, as a place of greater security. This information
     having been communicated to Sir William Staines, one of the
     present Sheriffs of London and Middlesex, with the zeal for the
     public good which characterises the active Magistrate, he went
     alone to Newgate, early in the morning, before the cells were
     unlocked, and caused the trunks, and boxes, belonging to the
     persons convicted of offences against the Mint Laws, to be
     searched; and, in a trunk concealed under _Pullen's_ bed, were
     found no less than £107, 2s. of base money, of the similitude of
     shillings, ready for circulation, and a machine for rounding, or
     milling, the edges of half crowns; and in another trunk belonging
     to an associate of _Pullen_, were found two plain dies, and two
     others for halfpence, and farthings. It would appear that some
     other dies for halfcrowns, and shillings, which had been
     deposited for some time in a trunk belonging to _Pullen_, were
     removed, together with the book he kept for entering the names of
     his customers who visited him, for the purpose of purchasing base
     money for the town, and country, circulation.... The Lord Mayor
     and Sheriffs have investigated the means by which these nefarious
     practices have been carried on, and, we are happy to learn, that
     it arose entirely from the arts, and devices, so familiar to
     criminals, without the knowledge, or privity, of the Turnkeys.
     The result is, that the Lord Mayor and Sheriffs are taking
     immediate steps for establishing such rules, as will probably
     prevent a repetition of the same evil."--(_Times, Nov. 29,
     1796._)


PRIZE FIGHTING AND DUELS.

Prize fighting was beginning to develop into a fine art, and it was
thought no more derogatory in a fine gentleman to assist, by his
presence, at a "Mill," than to be present at a Cock fight. It was
patronised by Royalty, as we see by the following Newspaper Cutting.
Indeed, the Prince of Wales attended several prize fights, until a man
was killed, and then he left the ring to itself.

     "On Friday, a battle was fought at Blackheath between Crabbe, a
     Jew, and Oliver, commonly called _Death_; in which the former was
     victorious. All the great patrons, and distinguished professors
     of this _fine art_ were present, and many bets were laid. The
     battle was honoured, in particular, by the attendance of his
     Royal Highness the Prince of Wales."--(_Morning Post, April 18,
     1788._)

Even those "feeble folk," those superfine gentlemen, the Macaronis,
learned to use their fists, as we see by this illustration.

Any one caring for such particulars will well know that this was the
golden age for pugilism. There were Tom Johnson, 1783-1791. Benjamin
Brain (Big Ben), 1786-1791. Daniel Mendoza, a Jew, 1784-1820. Richard
Humphries, "the Gentleman boxer," 1784-1790. John Jackson, 1788-1795.
Bill Hooper (the Tin man), 1789-1797. Tom Owen, 1796-1799-1820. Tom
Jones (Paddington Jones), 1786-1805. Bill Warr (of Bristol),
1787-1792. Will Wood, the Coachman, 1788-1804. George Ingleston, the
Brewer, 1789-1793. Bob Watson, of Bristol, 1788-1791. Tom Tyne, "the
Tailor," 1788-1792. Symonds (the Ruffian), 1791-1795. Jem Belcher,
1798-1809. This is the list of the Chief Gladiators of the period.

     "Mendoza's terms for teaching are reasonable enough--eight
     lessons for a guinea."--(_Morning Post, May 26, 1788._)

     "_Mendoza_ and _Ward_, finding that the blackguard exercise of
     boxing had fallen into disrepute, took up the _genteel_ trade of
     crimping, and became acting serjeants, at a house in St. George's
     Fields, until a stop was put to that nefarious business by
     authority. We are sorry to find that these notorious blackguards
     have since returned to their former occupation."--(_Times, April
     16, 1795._)

[Illustration: Boxing made easy, or Humphreys giving a lesson.--1788.]

Duels were of as common occurrence, as highway robberies, and need as
much comment. Still, I give two, or three, instances to show on what
trifles, men, then, ventured their lives.

The first is an ordinary duel between two officers, reported in the
_Morning Post_ of 22nd June 1788--in which one of them was wounded in
the thigh. This report brings a letter from some one, probably a
second, who gives his version thus:--"Sir, in your account of the duel
between Captains Tonge and Paterson, in your Paper of the 22nd, there
is a mistake or two, which, for the sake of truth, I beg leave to
correct. You say, 'that _Capt. T. wished to apologise for the injury
he had done_.' The truth is, Captain T. being not quite himself when
the affray happened, remembered very little of what had passed, except
that, on some provocation, he had struck Capt. P. Considering himself,
therefore, as having, _palpably_ broken the peace, he was ready to ask
Capt. P.'s pardon.

"This was not deemed sufficient satisfaction, and the duel took place.
You tell us, that _Capt. T.'s ball passed Capt. P._, thereby implying
that Capt. T. actually fired at his antagonist. Now, Sir, I can
positively affirm that Capt. T. was determined not to fire his pistol,
and that it was involuntarily discharged, after he was wounded, and
not levelled at Capt. P. You tell us then, that Capt. T., upon
falling, declared that '_he had merited his fate, and begged Capt.
P.'s pardon_.' His words were, _Are you satisfied? I fear I am
dangerously wounded, I therefore advise you to fly._

"To enable the Public to judge properly of this affair, it is
necessary they should be told, that the first offence was, Capt. T.'s
treading accidentally on Capt. P.'s heel, who, though he saw Capt. T.
was intoxicated, continued to follow him.

FRENCH EMIGRANTS.

We have seen how, at the outbreak of the French Revolution, the French
came over here in thousands--escaping here as to a haven of refuge.
For the most part they were of the better class; still there were, as
in 1870, a large number of very suspicious characters (to use the
mildest term) among them--and the government was compelled to keep a
very jealous eye on their movements. Taken, however, as a whole, they
behaved wonderfully well, and in no ways abused the asylum, and
protection, they had sought.

     "Government is ridding the country very fast of Jacobins: and in
     doing so, it is taking only a proper precaution during a time of
     war. Some hundreds have been already either expelled, or have
     quitted the country through apprehension; but many more still
     remain here: and we recommend very strongly to the notice of the
     Police Department, the general body of _French Dancing Masters_
     practising in London, who are the veriest Jacobins in existence.
     An exportation of some of these Hop Merchants, and certain French
     Milliners, whom we could name, might be permitted without a
     drawback, and without doing any injury to the Revenue."--(_Times,
     Feb. 15, 1793._)

       *       *       *       *       *

     "The _Maitre d'Hotel_ of the _Duke of York_ was, on Saturday
     last, ordered to quit the country. We some time since remarked
     that there were several rank Jacobins in his Royal Highness's
     household."--(_Times, Feb. 16, 1793._)

He was sent out of the Country either for theft or embezzlement.

     "The Jermyn-Street _Gun_, which is filled with combustible
     matter, should be unloaded, and spiked, or it may become more
     dangerous than it is even at present. A clause ought to be added
     to the _Alien Bill_, interdicting Frenchmen to meet, either in
     public, or private, houses, in a greater number than 5, at one
     and the same time. We cannot be too strict at this moment: and,
     being sojourners here, as objects of public bounty, they cannot
     complain of any regulations which Government may deem necessary
     to make."--(_Times, Feb. 16, 1793._)

     "The French Emigrants.[17]

          [Footnote 17: On March 6, there was a letter from the agents
          of the owners of the ship, putting a different complexion on
          the matter: the mutinous conduct of the emigrants being the
          cause of all the trouble.]

     "Some of the papers have circulated very idle reports relative to
     the arrival, in London, of 140 French soldiers; the story is
     precisely as follows: These unfortunate Emigrants, most of them
     descended from opulent, and illustrious, families in France,
     having saved themselves, with the French Princes, from the
     daggers of assassins, were necessitated, at the end of the
     campaign, to enter the service of Spain. They embarked, on the
     4th Dec., at _Bois le Duc_, for _Rotterdam_, and from thence,
     they sailed in the ship _David and Abraham_, commanded by Captain
     _Riendirk_. It would be impossible to describe the bad usage they
     received on board. Obliged to lay upon the bare deck, without a
     bed, and fed with mouldy biscuit, and beer, mixed with salt
     water; in this lamentable situation they remained five weeks.
     These miserable men were covered with vermin, most of them,
     dreadfully galled with sores, and ulcers. Some had not changed
     their linen for two years and an half: others had no linen of any
     kind, and the clothes of the whole troop were in tatters. There
     is reason to believe that the Captain of the vessel proposed to
     sell them as malefactors, to be sent to Batavia. The ship,
     however, was driven on our coast, and as soon as our Government
     was apprized that these poor men were at anchor in Sheerness,
     they took every measure to soften the rigour of their fate. Two
     of their countrymen were dispatched to bring them to London. The
     barbarous inhumanity of the Dutch Captain was notoriously
     conspicuous, and we hope some measures will be taken to bring him
     to justice, and make him an example to others, to avoid similar
     acts of inhumanity."--(_Times, Feb. 28, 1793._)

     "It is said that Lord Moira, notwithstanding the strange part he
     acts in domestic politics, distributes the amount of £10,000
     annually amongst the French Emigrants, who are only known to him
     by their distresses."--(_Times, Dec. 27, 1797._)

     "A French Emigrant was, yesterday, examined before Mr. Ford, at
     the Duke of Portland's Office, on a charge of being a Spy. The
     circumstances adduced were on the information of a Journeyman
     Shoemaker, against his Master, a Mr. Deboo, for making a pair of
     boots with a Cavity between the Soles; covered with sheet lead to
     prevent the wet perforating, for letters of a secret nature.
     After a long examination, it was proved that he was employed by
     the Duke d'Harcourt, on a mission to the officers of his corps in
     Germany, and, his papers containing nothing improper, he was
     discharged: but, the maker of the boots having been, for some
     time, considered a disaffected person, is to be sent out of the
     Kingdom under the Alien Bill."--(_Times, Jan. 6, 1798._)

     "In order to obtain a correct information of all the Foreigners
     who reside in this vast metropolis, and whose numbers are said to
     amount to 80,000, and upwards, Government has ordered the parish
     Officers to go from house, to house, and to take down the name of
     any foreigner who resides in the parish. This measure, we
     conceive, would become still more efficacious, if every landlord,
     or tenant, of a house, who lets out lodgings, were obliged to
     inform the Justice of the Peace, of every Foreigner who comes to
     lodge in his house, or leaves it. None but suspicious persons
     will have to complain of the severity of these
     measures."--(_Times, March 11, 1797._)




POLITICAL.


With Politics I had no intention of dealing, but the book would be
incomplete if there were no indication of the party strife of the
period, so that I have been tempted to make a few extracts
principally of 1793-4, when party spirit ran very high. The
revelations as to Elections, will, probably, somewhat astonish the
next generation.

     "The Marquis of Lansdowne's carriage conveyed the whole phalanx
     of opposition, in the house of Lords, to their respective homes,
     after the debate of Friday night: and even then, one corner of
     the coach was unoccupied.

     "The opposition in the Commons, who are a little more numerous,
     were all bundled into Mr. Fox's coach, and that of Michael Angelo
     Turner, with the assistance of a hackney-coach for Jack Courtney,
     and Jekyll.

     "Opposition, sunk to a minority that is insignificant in the
     extreme, was afraid to try the question, on Friday, in either
     House, well knowing that they could not reckon more than a dozen,
     in the Commons, and three in the House of Lords. Must not this
     convince the French of the unanimity of the people of
     England?"--(_Times, Feb. 4, 1793._)

       *       *       *       *       *

     "All the Members of the Opposition, in both Houses of Parliament,
     are to have a grand civic feast on Saturday next. Dinner is
     bespoke for FOURTEEN!!!"--(_Times, Feb. 5, 1793._)

     "The Irish papers are full of information of indictments on the
     part of the Crown, against the printers of newspapers in Ireland.
     Thirty or forty names are mentioned in one of the latest Gazettes
     from thence."--(_Times, Feb. 6, 1793._)


     COUNTY OF LEICESTER.--Dec. 19, 1792.

     "It appearing to be the unanimous opinion of all true friends of
     the Constitution, that, in order to prevent the mischievous
     consequences attending a misrepresentation of their sentiments,
     either at home, or abroad, some public avowal of their principles
     is become necessary; We, whose names are hereunto subscribed,
     adopting the resolutions of the Society, at the Saint Alban's
     Tavern, do hereby declare, that we are unanimously, and
     decidedly, of opinion, that, for the security and happiness of
     all classes of our fellow-subjects, for the maintenance of our
     own rights, and liberties, and, for the dearest interests of our
     posterity, it is, in the present moment, incumbent upon us to
     give to the Executive Government, a vigorous, and effectual,
     support, in counteracting the numerous efforts of sedition, in
     detecting, and bringing to legal punishment, the persons
     concerned therein, and in suppressing, in their beginning, all
     tumults, or riots, on whatever pretence they may be excited: do
     hereby publicly declare our determination to take all such steps
     for these purposes, as are within the limits of our duty, in the
     several stations in which the Constitution of our country has
     placed us, and to afford, by our individual exertions, that
     active assistance to the authority of the lawful Magistrate, and
     to the maintenance of the Established Government, which is at all
     times due from the subject of this realm; but which we feel to be
     more particularly necessary, under the circumstances of the
     present time.

     "For these purposes, and to this intent, we are resolved, and do
     declare--

     1. "That we will jointly, and individually, use our utmost
     endeavours to discover the Authors, Publishers, and Distributors,
     of all Seditious Writings, which shall be published, and
     distributed, within the County of Leicester, and particularly,
     all persons who shall be engaged in any illegal Associations, or
     Conspiracies, for the Publication, and Distribution, of such
     writings, or for the exciting Tumults, and Riots, within the said
     County.

     2. "That, in order to carry the above resolutions into effect, we
     do hereby, mutually, bind ourselves to each other, that whenever
     it shall come to our Knowledge, that any person, or persons,
     have, within the said County, Published, or Distributed,
     Seditious Writings, or engaged themselves in such Associations,
     or Conspiracies, for the purposes aforesaid, we will do our
     utmost endeavours to put the laws strictly in force against him,
     or them.

     3. "That we will, on every occasion, exert ourselves, on the
     first appearance of Tumult, or Disorder, to maintain the public
     peace, and to act in support of the civil authority, for
     suppressing all Riots, and for bringing the promoters of them to
     legal punishment.

     "Those who agree in the principles here stated, are invited to
     set their names to this Declaration--Copies of which will be
     sent, for that purpose, to every town, and village, in the
     county, at the Banks of Boultbee & Co., and Bensley & Co., in
     Leicester, and at the Post Offices, in the several Market Towns
     of the county, Subscriptions will be received, from such persons,
     as may be willing to contribute, towards defraying the expenses,
     which may be incurred in carrying into execution the measures
     here stated, and in counteracting the mistaken, and pernicious,
     notions which are so industriously circulated."--(_Times, Feb. 7,

     foreigners, under the roofs of those who give them bread, utter
     the most treasonable blasphemies against the present Government
     of this country. As some new tax may be requisite, to assist the
     necessary resources of Government, a most heavy impost on French
     servants would be extremely popular. The Steward, the Butler, the

         The prop of her Church, the support of her Laws;
         He ne'er with Republicans chose to accord,
         And his Foes never call'd him the Levelling Lord.
         He made the fam'd Peace of the year Eighty Three,
         A Peace, John, as good for himself, as for thee.
         In his speech he is open, and candid no doubt,
         For which side he espouses, no man can find out;
         Whether Whig, whether Tory, of High Church, or Low;
         You may puzzle your brains, but you never will know.

     will prove that want of information is not numbered among the
     wants of Administration. A Young Gentleman, Clerk in an Office
     under Government, in consequence of strong entreaties from a
     friend, accompanied him to a meeting of about thirty, at a
     tavern, when, after dinner, several very seditious toasts were
     given, the visitor was called on, and gave the King; this toast,
     however, being rejected, and all expostulations proving in vain,
     he left the company soon after, and the next day, by the advice
     of his friends, waited on Mr. Pitt, to tell his story. But, judge
     his surprise, when the Minister, interrupting him, produced a
     paper, in which was written the names of the parties, the order
     in which they sate, the toasts drank, and here, sir, added Mr.
     Pitt, observe your own name placed at the bottom!!!"--(_Times,

     "Yesterday conformable to an ancient ridiculous custom, came on
     the Election, at Wandsworth, for a Mayor of Garratt. The
     candidates were two--Sir _George Cooke_, Greengrocer and
     Inhabitant of Lambeth: and Sir _Harry Dimsdale_, a Muffin Baker.
     Sir _George_ set off from his house in the morning, surrounded by
     all the appendages of grandeur, and placed in an open landau,
     drawn by six beautiful horses, with postillions on the first
     four, elegantly attired in red. A coach and four preceded him all
     the way in equal style.

     "After he had arrived at the entrance of Wandsworth, his horses
     were taken out by the mob, and he was drawn by them to the
     Hustings, where he joined his opponent, who was little short of
     Sir _George_ in point of _etiquette_. After a long preamble from
     each party, promising unremitting attention to the duties of the
     office, the honours of the day were conferred on Sir George
     Cooke."--(_Times, Aug. 25, 1796._)

     "Garrat Election.--Most of the Morning Prints of yesterday
     misstated this business. It was Sir _Harry Dimsdale_, and not Sir
     _George_ Cooke, who was returned. Those who supported Sir George,
     did not even put him in nomination. He was drawn there, it is
     true, but he made no stand: he gave up the contest, and Sir Harry
     was crowned with a green bough, and the horses taken from his
     carriage by the populace, who drew him in triumph to the Bull, at
     East Sheen, to dinner, where above six hundred people sat down to
     a plentiful dinner. After dinner, it was proposed that Sir Harry
     should go, on Friday, in State, to the Royal Circus, in St.
     George's Fields, and this motion being carried, we understand the
     Muffin Knight will actually be there this evening."--(_Times,
     Aug. 26, 1796._)

This was the last of these mock elections--and we may well pause for a
while, and examine this curious institution--unique in its way--not
thoroughly well-known--and whose origin, even, is in dispute.

Not far from Wandsworth, on the road to Tooting, is found the hamlet
of Garrett, or Garrat, which, in the time of Queen Elizabeth, appears
to have consisted of a single house, called "the Garvett." This was,
at the time of its destruction, about the year 1760, in the possession
of the Broderick family, and its grounds were then let to a market
gardener. Lyson's, writing in 1792, says the hamlet consisted of about
50 houses--but it grew until it became incorporated into Wandsworth,
and its site is still known by "Garret Lane," "Garret Green," "Garret
Hill," &c.

As regards the curious mock election which took place here with each
new Parliament, nothing certain is known, and opinions are divided, as
to its origin. Dr. Ducarel, an antiquary, writing in 1754, tells us,
that as far as he can find out, it began, some 60 or 70 years
previously, with some Wandsworth Watermen, who went to a public house,
called the Leather Bottle, at Garrat, to spend a merry day--and, it
being a general election, they, in fun, chose one of their number as
Member for Garrat.

[Illustration: Jeffrey Dunstan,--Ordinary Costume.]

Another version is given in the "Gentleman's Magazine" for 1781, in
which a writer says he was told, that about thirty years previously,
several persons who lived near that part of Wandsworth which adjoins
to Garrat Lane, had formed a kind of Club, not merely for the
pleasures of the table, but to concert measures for removing the
encroachments made on that part of the Common; and to prevent any
others being made, for the future. When a sufficient sum of money had
been subscribed amongst them, they brought an action against the
encroacher, in the name of the president (or, as they called him,
Mayor,) of the Club. They gained their suit, with costs, and, ever
after, the president, was called "the Mayor of Garrat." This event
happening at the time of a general election, the ceremony, which took
place every new parliament, of choosing _outdoor_ members for the
borough of Garrat, was continued.

The earliest record of Members being chosen, is in 1747, when three
Candidates for the honour appeared. Lord Twankum Squire Blow me down
(Willis, a Waterman) and Squire Gubbins, (one Simmonds, a publican.)
The "Clerk," and "Recorder," issued from an imaginary Town Hall. There
were proper Hustings, at which an oath was administered to the
electors which, according to Grose, was sworn on a brick bat--and the
qualification was, that the juror had had an amour in the surrounding
open fields.

There was a great deal of rough wit in the candidate's speeches, and
Foote, Garrick, and Wilkes, were credited with writing their
addresses. Foote even wrote a play, called "the Mayor of Garratt,"
which was produced at Drury Lane. There were elections in 1761, 1763,
1768, &c. That of 1781--was famous for the magnificence of its
procession--having a real live man in armour. In 1784, Sir Jeffrey
Dunstan (they all dubbed themselves knights) was elected to the
honourable post, and he held it till his death in 1796.

This worthy needs a passing notice. His birth, and education, were but
humble, for he was found, wrapped in a cloth, on the door step of a
Church warden, of St. Dunstan's in the East--hence his name of
Dunstan. He grew up deformed, and rickety, and, at the age of 12, was
apprenticed to a greengrocer, for 9 years--but the servitude galled
him, and he ran away, finding employment at Birmingham. He returned to
London in 1776 and soon afterwards married--and had two daughters, who
were really fine young women. He was squalid, and filthy, in his
dress, and got his living by buying, and selling, old wigs. His
humour, however, gained him his election for Garrett. The accompanying
illustrations shew him in his ordinary dress, as "Old Wigs," and in
the superb court suit which he sported at election times.

The Election, at last, led to such disgraceful scenes, that even the
publicans, who were its chief mainstay, would no longer support it:
and Sir Harry Dimsdale, holds the proud pre-eminence of being the last
elected Member.

ROYALTY.


Lives of the Georges, and their families, have been written _ad
nauseam_, and I did not intend making any notes upon the Royal
personages, then living--but I found some few paragraphs, which lie
outside regular history, and may interest my readers.

     "It was rather unfortunate for the Prince of Wales's proxy at the
     Court of Brunswick, that he should be attacked with the Gout, on
     the night of the marriage ceremony! Lord Malmesbury continued to
     be confined to his room when the last accounts came from
     Brunswick."--(_Times, Dec. 15, 1794._)

       "At such a time, the Gout to have,
         Is much to be lamented,
       What must the Royal Bride conceive
         Of him you represented?

       But charms like hers, in bloom of life,

     approaching nuptials of the Prince, and Princess of Wales. The

     white satin. The ornamental part is spoken of as being extremely

     9, 1796._)

The _Times_ of Jan. 17, 1798, contains a paragraph, showing the
domesticity, and simplicity of life, in the Royal Family.

     "The Princess of Wirtemberg expects to lie in, towards the latter
     end of next month; and her Majesty, and the Princesses, are very
     busily employed in making the childbed linen, which is to be a
     present from the Queen."

     "The BALL-ROOM. The Ball was the thinnest, in company, that we
     have ever witnessed, there being only two Ladies on the benches
     allotted for those who dance. Neither the Prince, nor Princess,
     of Wales, the Duke, or Duchess of York, were present. Soon after
     nine o'clock, their Majesties entered the Ball-room. The Duke of
     Clarence danced the two first minuets with the Princess Augusta,
     and two more with the Princess Elizabeth, which is very unusual.
     Prince William danced the next two with the Princess Mary, and
     two more with the Princess Sophia. Lord Morton then danced two
     dances with Lady Murray, daughter to the Duke of Athol, and two
     more with Lady M. Thynne. There were four country Dances, but
     only six couple. The Ball broke up soon after 11
     o'clock."--(_Times, Jan. 19, 1798._)

Here is a specimen of Royal economy, which was certainly unpopular:--

     "Some of the cream-coloured horses formerly attached to the Royal
     Coach, and which were only used on state days, are now employed
     in the daily drudgery of hackney coaches. The present proprietor
     values them very highly, and thinks, from their great receipt of
     custom, that they will draw him into an easy fortune."--(_Times,
     Aug. 10, 1796._)

       *       *       *       *       *

     "To the CONDUCTOR of the TIMES.

     "Sir,--Among many others, I was yesterday a spectator of what you
     notice in your paper of this morning. A pair of those noble
     animals, which, for several years, have drawn his Majesty's State
     Coach, degraded to a hack. The spectacle really gave me concern,
     and must certainly reflect disgrace somewhere. It necessarily
     suggests two considerations, one relative to the dignity of
     Majesty itself, the other to the natural emotions of sensibility.
     What! say the vulgar, are the _King's_ State Horses come to this?
     Oh! what a pity! says the man of sensibility, that these poor
     creatures recently, and habitually, so caressed, and pampered,
     should experience such a lamentable reverse! How fallen, how
     abused, how galled! I assure you, Mr. Editor, they are
     _literally_, and _grievously_, _galled_. Surely his Majesty must
     be a stranger to all this: and it would be of no dis-service to
     him, to let the Public know that he is so. Those who love him,
     cannot but feel for his horses, nor refrain from thinking that
     his sensibility, as a man, must be hurt, at hearing of the
     sufferings of those stately animals, which once contributed to
     his most magnificent public appearance.

                                         A Dutiful Subject."

     --(_Times, Aug. 12, 1796._)

Here is a bit of Satire on the Prince of Wales, who was notoriously at
variance with both his father and mother.

     "An illustrious Personage is now engaged in making a collection
     of the profile likenesses of his friends. The number already
     collected is stated to amount to _fifty_. His friends are
     certainly more numerous than those of almost any Prince we ever
     heard of, except our own Sovereign. The wealthy Croesus had but
     one friend, and that was his son."--(_Times, Nov. 6, 1799._)




VARIETIES.


The year 1788 begins well, with an account of a coming of age, which
seems to have been conducted in the classical taste peculiar to this
period.

     "The late celebration of Miss Pulteney coming of age, bore much
     the appearance of idolatrous sacrifice. The procession headed by
     an _ox_, adorned with _flowers_, his horns painted _blue_, and
     _tipped with gold_, preceded by a band of music, and afterwards
     offered up, were all so much in character, that could the _High
     Priest_, himself, of Rome been present, and beheld the charming
     object of their veneration, he would have mistaken her for a
     _Venus_, and joined the throng, with all that ardour the
     immediate presence of a divinity ought to inspire."--(_Morning
     Post, Jan. 1, 1788._)

The following advertisement from the _Morning Post_ of March 13, 1788,
gives us perhaps the earliest glimmer of reform on the old tinder box,
flint and steel, and matches, Lucifer Matches not being generally used
till 1834:--

     "For Travellers, Mariners, &c.

     "Promethean Fire and Phosphorus.

     "G. Watts respectfully acquaints the public, that he has prepared
     a large variety of machines of a portable, and durable kind, with
     Promethean fire, paper and match inclosed, most admirably
     calculated to prevent those disagreeable sensations, which
     frequently arise in the dreary hour of midnight, from the sudden
     alarm of thieves, fire, or sickness; as, by procuring an
     instantaneous light, the worst calamities and depredations might
     often be prevented in families. Experience has likewise proved
     this invention to be of the first utility to the traveller,
     mariners, and those people who frequently rise in the
     night-time, as they can, with one of these matches procure light
     instantly, without the great expence, and danger, of burning a
     lamp or candle."

Anything that illustrates the Social Life of "Old Times," must needs
be of interest, even though, as in the accompanying engraving, the
subject be painful. It is by Rowlandson, and shews, better than words
can convey, the then treatment of that saddest of all human
maladies--mental aberration.

Chained by the neck to a wall--scantily clothed--barefoot, and with
but straw to lie on, was hardly the usage by which the alienated
intellect could be restored to its proper tone--yet so it was, in too
many cases, that mad people were treated: the whip, and even harsher
punishment following, should they show any signs of rebellion.

     "The bet of his Grace of Bedford, that Lord Barrymore will not
     eat a live Cat, is not without precedent on the records of
     sporting. On a wager of fifty pounds, a fellow who lived near the
     race-course of Kildare, in Ireland, devoured five fox cubs, and
     literally began eating each while alive. It is, however, to be
     observed, that the devourer was a natural fool, having been born
     deaf, dumb, and without a palate."--(_Morning Post, Mar. 15,
     1788._)

       *       *       *       *       *

     "A fine topaz sold at Tenducci's sale for seven guineas; the
     finest in the kingdom: is the property of Mrs. More of Stockwell,
     and what, perhaps, would increase its value in the estimation of
     many people, this topaz once belonged to Queen Anne. It is near
     an inch in diameter, and of most uncommon brilliancy."--(_Morning
     Post, Ap. 17, 1788._)

That Agriculture was not neglected, we can well imagine, for England
had to be almost self contained, as regarded food for her
population--but few know to what a pitch of perfection sheep breeding
was carried--nor the enormous prices paid for the hire of stud rams.

[Illustration: Treatment of Lunatics.]

     "Mr. Bakewell, the famous grazier, has lost one of his most
     remarkable rams. It was of such value, that he let it out to
     hire, and received £400 for the season."--(_Morning Post, Sept.
     12, 1788._)

This was the far famed agriculturist. Robert Bakewell--who brought his
father's famous "Dishley" sheep to such perfection, that in 1787, he
let three rams, for a year, for £1250, and was offered, but refused,
£1050 for twenty ewes. When we think of the difference of the value of
Currency, then, and now, these prices are fairly staggering. These
Dishley sheep had good qualities, they were quiet--they fattened
quickly, and well--and they had small bones. But Bakewell, even in his
cattle, as well as his sheep, always kept in view, what, even now, are
the guiding principles in our Cattle shows--Perfection of form--the
most meat from the least food--the least offal--and large joints with
small bones.

     "The following is a copy of a hand bill, which was a few days ago
     distributed in the city of Edinburgh:--

     "'_Thou shalt not steal_--All persons whom it may concern are
     desired to take notice, that _steel traps of the largest sort_,
     for catching breakers of the eighth Commandment, are, every

     "Natural History.

     "A very curious incident happened near Edmonton last week, to
     account for which we are unable, and leave the explanation to
     botanical and Chirurgical professors.

     "A farmer requested some lettuces from a gentleman in the
     neighbourhood, who permitted the farmer's maid to gather what she
     wanted; she gathered likewise some Cucumbers, and near them were
     glasses covering sensitive and humble plants, which the wench
     gathered as small sallad.

     "The farmer eat heartily of these, and the effect was, that after
     dinner, tho' he is a very fat man, a slight touch from another
     person made him shrink at least five stone; but, towards the
     evening, he recovered gradually his usual bulk and weight; and,
     when he had evacuated the sallad and mimosa, he retained his
     corpulency as if nothing extraordinary had happened.

     "This we insert as a caution to persons not to mix this plant
     with other pot herbs."--(_Morning Post, Aug. 31, 1789._)

     "A Card

     "Addressed to those among the female sex, whose desires are
     neither Romantic nor Extravagant, who stand in need and wish for
     such an opportunity as is now offered.

     "A SINGLE GENTLEMAN who is blest with an Independence, adequate
     to every real comfort in life, and having none to provide for,
     prefers permanent friendship and protection to a Lady possessing
     the following requisites: age not exceeding 35, person well
     shaped, teeth sound and regular, good voice, a stranger to the
     hackneyed tricks of the town: good temper, constancy, a social
     disposition, engaging manners, a turn to economy, and a knowledge
     by experience of domestic concerns, a taste for simplicity and
     elegance in dress, spruce in her person, and attentive to
     neatness in others; free from incumbrance, affectation and
     unpleasant habits: a pleasing countenance, if the face should
     neither be beautiful nor pretty--musical talents, vocal and
     instrumental--and she who may be the greatest proficient on the
     pianoforte or harpsichord, or what is still more irresistible,
     the harp, if in other respects equal, will claim the preference.
     The Lady, of course, must be totally at her own disposal: if a
     native of Britain, a Knowledge of French so as to speak it
     fluently; if a foreigner, capable of speaking and writing the
     English language with ease and propriety: and both native, and
     foreign, habituated to the English Customs in every point of
     cleanliness and delicacy.

     "Should she be conversant with Italian, with a genius for
     painting, poetry, astronomy, botany, &c., she would be the more
     acceptable. Not only the utmost regard to decorum will be
     observed upon this occasion, but that respect which the delicacy
     of the sex demands, shall be manifested as early as possible. He
     hopes, therefore, since his motives are so obvious, that those
     whose sentiments are congenial with his own, who mean to notice
     this address will do it speedily, as the Author will soon be
     going to the Continent on an extensive tour.

     "For this and other cogent reasons, which hereafter may be
     specified, Principals only will be treated with. Such
     communications, and positively no other, as are written in the
     Party's own hand, at once explicit respecting situation,
     intention and expectation, &c., shall according to their merits
     be duly acknowledged, and the necessary steps in consequence
     will be pointed out to bring the matter with safety to an
     immediate issue.

     "Should an object whose person, talents, and accomplishments,
     &c., are superior to the generality of females, be discovered
     with proofs of serious intention, a marriage may be the result.
     The want of pelf, if of a respectable connection, should with the
     Author, be no impediment thereto, being, with prudence, amply
     provided for. The Advertiser forbears saying any more of himself,
     than that his person, age, qualities, &c., would probably suit
     such a Lady as he has described: and as a well cultivated mind,
     united with the requisites above stated, would be preferred to
     the consideration of either family, or fortune, he hopes some
     credit will be allowed him for his good intentions.

     "A person who has been six months deprived of what he calls
     Heaven's chiefest blessing, domestic happiness, is not ashamed of
     thus avowing his intention of again endeavouring to regain, by
     Marriage, that solid felicity he so much regrets the loss of, and
     hopes this way to become acquainted with some Maiden Lady, who
     has a soul superior to vulgar prejudices, and who will venture to
     go a little out of the beaten road, in order to form a truly
     rational plan for that sociable happiness which is only to be
     found in the Marriage State. The writer of this has no children,
     his age is between 40 and 50: he has acquired, by trade, £20,000,
     has a house at the West end of the town, another in Kent, and a
     Coach to take him from one to the other: so that he thinks
     himself deserving of a Lady of equal fortune: the more so, as he
     will permit her to make it over to herself or her relations: and
     if she should not possess more than half that sum, 'he'd ne'er
     quarrel for that.'--A line, addressed to W. W., No. 32 Snow Hill,

     "THE FUNERAL!!

     "It was not a Tom Cat, for its melodious squalls plainly proved
     it had long been qualified for the Opera.--It was, however, a
     prodigious favourite with its Mistress. Long had it lived upon
     the fat of the land, in Charlotte St., Queen Anne St., where it
     took great care of Number One! For the space of six years and
     three months did its Mistress indulge it with 'Rivers of Milk;'
     and besides it was a sad Cat, for the matter of that, in skimming
     the cream off everything worth skimming. But as Cats, though they
     may have nine lives, are not immortal, poor Ralph fell sick and
     died--without giving time even for a consultation of Physicians!
     His Mistress, after the first transports of grief were subsided,
     sent for a Surgeon, who opened the body. He reported that poison
     was not the cause, as suspected, of his death, but that he was
     literally killed with kindness. In plain English, he died of a
     Plethora, for he was fat at heart.

     "Away posted the Lady and purchased a piece of ground, just large
     enough to swing a Cat in, at the new burial ground in
     Mary-le-bonne. The charge was trifling, only two guineas; an
     Undertaker provided a coffin in miniature: _Grimalkin_, after
     having lain in state, and several of the frail sisterhood,
     friends of the Lady, partaken of wine and cake, of which plenty
     was provided; a Hearse with White Plumes drove to the door, and
     the Lady, a Chief Mourner, attended by her weeping friends, who
     filled several Mourning Coaches, followed Ralph to the grave last
     Tuesday week, like 'Niobe all in tears;' and after the body had
     been deposited in the earth, though with but 'maimed rites,' 'tis
     true, she returned slowly to the house of mourning.

     "But now comes the sad Cat-astrophe--Whether the Undertaker who
     had _undertaken_ to keep the secret, had blabbed, or whether the
     spectators of this sad ceremony smelt, as the Cat had often done,
     a RAT, so it was, however, that the body had not remained an
     hour, quietly inurned, ere they burst open the hinges of its
     sepulchre, and parading with it to the place from whence it came,
     proceeded to break the windows of the afflicted fair one's
     house: and but for the timely interposition of the Magistrates,
     the Lady, as well as her house, in all probability would have
     been pulled to pieces!!!

We get a very vivid description of how illuminations after a great
victory, were managed and received--in those which took place after
Lord Howe's "Glorious first of June."

     Earl Howe's Victory.

     "Several mobs paraded about the streets, at one, and two o'clock,
     yesterday morning, breaking the windows of those who had already
     shown their good wishes to the general cause, by illuminating
     their windows, but had retired to rest. Other houses again,
     belonging to the Quakers, were damaged because no lights were put
     forth. Such acts are contrary to the way of thinking of this very
     respectable class of Citizens. In this outrageous manner did
     several mobs proceed during the early part of yesterday morning,
     to the very great inconvenience of domestic comfort, and
     infringement on public tranquillity."--(_Times, June 13, 1794._)

       *       *       *       *       *

     "The Lord Mayor requests the Inhabitants of the City to
     discontinue the Illuminations which have taken place since the
     News received of the very glorious Victory obtained by the
     British Fleet, under the command of Lord Howe. The Lord Mayor
     hopes, that the Public will be satisfied with the general Joy
     which has been so conspicuously expressed, and thinks that a
     further display of it will tend to disturb the peace and good
     order of the Metropolis."--(_Times, June 14, 1794._)

     "Illuminations.--The very idea of the horrors attending the cry
     of 'Put out your lights,' made a poor Loyal German, in
     Bedfordbury, watch his little farthing rush-lights, on Wednesday
     last, till a late hour. At length he ventured really to put out
     his lights: prudently pasting up at his door the following notice
     in capitals: 'Two o'clock--gone to bed. If I am to light again,
     pray be so obliging as to ring the bell.'"--(_Times, June 19,

     "A Gentleman of a village near town, in his zeal for illuminating
     on the late joyful Victory by Lord Howe, placed so many candles
     in his windows, and that in so negligent a manner, that by two in
     the morning, three or four of his sashes were burnt. A Constant

     "The following circumstance occurred last week at Long Milford
     near Bury St. Edmund's: Three young Ladies of that place, one of
     whom is very much celebrated for her mental, as well as personal,
     accomplishments, agreed a few days since, to bathe in a river
     about half a mile distant from the town, there being no private
     accommodation for that purpose in the neighbourhood.

     "An early hour, at which they would be the least liable to be
     discovered by strangers, was determined on, and at four o'clock
     in the morning, they proceeded from home to the appointed place.
     As they walked through the town, they were espied by a
     blacksmith, who, about the same hour, usually gets up to his
     work. Curiosity prompted him to find out whither the fair ones
     were bound: but he did not discover himself to them till they
     were in the river, the perfect images of their mother _Eve_; when
     perceiving him approach, they screamed out, and prudently sat
     down in the water. The Modern _Vulcan_, dead to the distresses of
     the Venus's, determined to divert his uncouth fancy by carrying
     off their clothes, with which he did not return. In this pitiable
     situation they were obliged to remain for near an hour, when a
     poor woman passing that way, on hearing the rude behaviour they
     had experienced, and their consequent embarrassment, procured
     them such necessary articles of apparel, as enabled them to get
     home.

     "The blacksmith has since made a public boast of his exploit,
     saying it was a fine piece of sport: and, owing to his unfeeling
     and brutish conduct, the young Ladies have ever since been
     ashamed to be seen, even by their relations."--(_Times, Aug. 8,
     1794._)

       *       *       *       *       *

     "The three _water nymphs_ at Bury have preferred an indictment
     against the blacksmith who stole their cloaths, and this may
     probably turn out a very serious affair, and make poor _Vulcan_
     pay for his _peeping_."--(_Times, Aug. 9, 1794._)

     "Bath Charter.--A further degree of power, to be vested in the
     Magistrates, being deemed necessary, a new charter was a short
     time since granted for that purpose. It was sent by the Mail
     Coach, and for want of care in the packing, the impression of the
     Great Seal was knocked to atoms. It was presented to the Lord
     Chancellor to be resealed: but this his Lordship refused unless
     the Mayor and Corporation would petition the Court setting forth
     the reasons. The Charter of Bath conveys the exclusive privilege

We have seen, in the Historical Summary attached to this book, how
gallantly, year after year, Wilberforce attacked slavery. In England,
we see, they euphemised the word _slave_, and called them _Indented
Black Servants_, the same as those poor wretched white slaves, the
"Redemptioners" who sold themselves into bondage in the Plantations.

     "Absconded from his master's service at Cheltenham, on Friday
     night the 8th August, between the hours of 9 and 10, an INDENTED
     BLACK SERVANT LAD, named TONEY, aged about 19 or 20 years. He is
     very black, and slender made, but with remarkably long feet. He
     went off in a striped dressing jacket, nankeen waistcoat and
     breeches, ribbed cotton stockings, shoes and plated buckles. He
     is articled for 5 years, from the 21 April last; and upwards of
     £30 has been laid out upon him, in having him taught to shave and
     dress, cloathing, and other necessaries for him. A reward of TEN
     POUNDS will be paid to any person who shall apprehend, and
     deliver him, to Mr. Coningham, Sherborne Lane, London; or lodge
     him in any Gaol in this Kingdom, and give notice thereof as
     above. There is every reason to believe, that great art, and
     industry, have been used to seduce, and spirit away, the lad;
     otherwise that he would not have formed a thought of quitting his
     master. If, therefore, any person will give such information, and

     "On Tuesday last, the corpse of a Gentleman, as it was proceeding
     in a hearse to the Burial Ground, was arrested by a Sheriff's
     officer and his followers, under a warrant as usual granted
     against the _body_. The friends who followed, immediately left
     their coaches, and told the officer, if he chose, he was welcome
     to the body, but he should have neither _coffin_, _shroud_, nor
     any particle in which the body was enveloped; and if he took them
     by force, he should be indicted for a _highway robbery_, as those
     matters were the property of the Executors; nay, they went
     further, and said, that as the deceased had, by his will,
     bequeathed his body to the Executors, no _execution_ would hold
     good against the corpse, the process must be against them. The
     Bailiff, very properly being persuaded that the spirit of the law
     meant a _living_, and not a dead _body_, marched off without
     insisting on the _legality of his capture_. This is the first
     instance of the kind that has happened since the arrest of the
     dead body of a Sheriff of London, not many years
     since."--(_Times, Sept. 5, 1794._)

     "Sir,--Leaving a shop in the City a few days ago, I fell into a
     reverie with the thoughts of what trade would come to next
     century: how it would be conducted, and by what description of
     persons: as in the shop I had just left, one servant said to
     another, 'Do you know were _Master_ S---- is gone'? Another
     answers, _Mr._ R---- (which was an apprentice) knows: _ask him_.
     Presently came down stairs a maid servant, to enquire whether all
     the _gentlemen_ (meaning the shopmen) would come to dinner. Half

     These gentlemen, determined not to be behindhand with their
     predecessors: and, in the last harvest, sent to the Parson to
     take away his _hay_ the moment it was cut down, alleging, that as
     soon as it was cut into _swathes_, it was no longer grass, and
     that he might _turn it, and cook it, himself_. Rather than 'go to
     law' the Parson submitted, and took his next Sunday's text on
     _brotherly kindness_, beginning thus--'Brotherly kindness may be
     divided into _three_ parts--domestic affection--social love--and
     charity: from all which proper inferences may be drawn for
     instruction. Thus brethren, I give you a sermon in _swathes_--you

     "A DAY AT MARGATE.

     "Rose at seven; went to Sayer's Bathing House, set my name down
     on the slate: took a walk on the Pier. Came back and waited a
     quarter of an hour, then bathed. Not a little delighted with the
     idea of realising in some degree _la theorie des sentimens
     agreables_ by dipping in the same ocean with the sea nymphs from
     the City. Returned to my lodgings to dress for breakfast. Finding
     nobody in the Coffee-room, went back to the Pier, arrived at the
     happy moment, just as a hoy was vomiting out its sick: witnessed,
     as Peter Paragraph says, the Queen of France abuse, like a drab
     of Drury, one of the passengers. The case seemed a strong one,
     and well made out on the part of the Lady, but produced, as far
     as I saw, no conviction.

     "Went to breakfast at Benson's, having first called at the
     Post-Office, and found _not sorted_ on the door: eat my
     shilling's worth, one buttered roll, one dry toasted, and one
     cold ditto: heard who had won, or lost, at whist, and billiards,
     the night before; read the newspapers, and wrote a letter. Went
     over the way to Silver's library, who at my request gave me the
     choice of three rides, observing, that I might take a little of
     each by going round by Kingsgate, the North Foreland, and
     Broadstairs to Ramsgate, then crossing over to the Camp, and
     figuring in by Dandelion. 'What a charming General' (said I)
     'spoilt in a Toyman. How you understand tactics, Mr. Silver!'
     'Used to it all my life, Sir,' (said he with a pleasing
     flippancy) 'plan rides for the company daily all over the
     Island.' Set out with the _carte du pays_ in my pocket: visited
     all the places in it, and finished with the cricket match, and
     the place of the public breakfast. Heard a lady say she had won
     two lotteries, and saw _Tom Lord_ run without winning a notch.
     Went to the ordinary in the gardens at 6s. 6d. a head, for cold
     chicken, and roast lamb, with a haunch of venison given by a
     Noble Lord, who, very kindly, having helped himself to the first
     slice, sent it on. The heat on the cricket ground was intense. I
     was sorry I did not bring my white hat: but a remedy was at hand,
     as I learnt afterwards, if I had been ingenious enough to have
     tied a white handkerchief round the crown of my black one. Having
     finished my second breakfast, I rode home to dine at Margate. The
     green where the breakfast was, was much cooler than the burning
     cricket field, having the advantage of being shaded by the trees
     in the garden at its back; but I found I was out of luck, as
     there was no dancing, and, indeed, at the public breakfast, it
     sometimes happens, that the wagtails, and the yellow-hammers from
     the Capital are so numerous, and frisky, that the humming birds,
     the cockatoos, and the birds of Paradise of the higher order
     won't always hop with them. Got back to Margate on my pony, for
     which I was to pay 18d. a side, and thought as I rode along on
     the sands, where I should dine. The boarding houses were all open
     to me, on paying for a week, or one guinea. This was a great
     temptation: but having been offered a party at the Bowling green,
     on Prospect Place, I conceived this to be a better thing, on
     account of the humours of the loaded pigeon, and the fun of the
     canting machine, and the fireworks at night. I accordingly rode
     to my lodgings to dress, and went immediately to dinner. After
     dinner proceeded to the libraries, where the raffling lists were
     filling fast: was induced to throw in my shillings at Silver's
     and Were's: from thence passed on to Wood's, Surflen's, and
     Garner's. At Surflen's heard music, and several favourite glees:
     from thence to the playhouse, where I was invited to the
     rehearsal of a new piece, which was to be full of good things, if
     it had been suffered to be represented. It was now time to go to
     supper: I accordingly returned to the Coffee House, and from
     thence to the Billiard Room, where there was a violent cry of
     swindler, black-legs, and pickpocket, at which Mrs. Benson
     interfered, whilst her husband walked coolly up and down the
     Piazza, not venturing to intrude. The obnoxious person being
     turned out, and order restored, I retired at one o'clock in the
     morning.

     "Our early season has already begun, and those who are fond of
     cheap lodgings, have made their appearance _hirundine primâ_. I
     assure you, we have City Misses here at this moment, each of
     whom, in the vain idea of rising 'A new born Goddess from the
     Sea' sowces into salt water every morning. Our company is of the
     _greater_ sort. We have Mrs. Deputy _Plumb_, with her naked
     daughters, who have scarce more cloathing than a _fig_ leaf on
     them, and imitate their great grand-dame Eve in much more even
     than that. Then we have Mrs. _Pop_ from Whitechapel. She came
     down in state in her own job-coach, which was loaded so full with
     _unredeemed_ Articles for family wear, that her dear _pledges_ of
     domestic Love, her daughters, who are the very _duplicate_ of
     herself, in delicacy and beauty, were forced to come in the Hoy.
     But she vows it is so shocking to her feelings, that they never
     shall ride down _no more_ in that nasty sort of water conveyance,
     though she should spend upon their luxury and elegance _ten_,
     out of that _thirty per cent._, which she grinds from the
     necessitous miseries of hard-earned industry. Then we have three
     learned Ladies, who, after the great fatigues of novel-writing in
     the winter, have retired hither to display themselves to the vast
     pleasure, and edification, of some ancient enamoratus, who would
     not yield to Old Q himself in pretensions to gallantry. In truth,
     we begin to look gaily, early as it is: and I would that the
     salt-water, for the benefit of the _Pops_, and the _Plumbs_, who
     frequent our watering places, could as easily wash away the mud
     of vulgarity, and affectation, from their hearts, as it does the
     _rouge_ from their faces."--(_Times, July 8, 1796._)

     from the Public the accommodation of finding them Pewter Pots,
     agreeable to a long established custom, which will, of course,
     occasion great inconvenience to workmen of every description, who
     are employed in raising buildings, repairing houses, &c.; as well
     as lodgers, and, even, to many respectable families. The profits

     means of preserving our lamps from being broken, is to take them
     down by night, and put them up in the day.' Such of the Publicans

     of a few pots, beyond that of the most respectable of their
     customers. It is, however, very probable, that the Small-Beer

Bartholomew fair was first held A.D. 1133, and it was then the
principal mart for the vendors, and buyers, of cloth: in fact the name
of a street, contiguous to Smithfield, where the fair was held, and
which has come down to us,--"Cloth fair," proves it, were there any
need. Of late years it got a nuisance, and public opinion demanded its
dissolution. The shows were discontinued in 1850, and the fair was
proclaimed, for the last time, in 1855. We see by the following
paragraph, from the _Times_, what was thought of it by decent-minded
people, as far back as 1796.

     "BARTHOLOMEW FAIR.

     "The various troops of itinerant Comedians, Showmen, Ropedancers,
     Jugglers, Conjurors, Fortune Tellers, Giants, Dwarfs, wild
     Beasts, learned Beasts, and every _lusus naturæ_ that can be
     collected throughout the Kingdom, with all the appendages of
     immorality, and vice, were on Saturday put in legal possession of
     Smithfield, as the theatre of their achievements. When we add to
     these, the numerous tribe of pickpockets, ring-droppers, and
     sharpers of every description, we cannot but sincerely regret,
     that a scene, productive of so much idleness, and debauchery,
     should be sanctioned by the _letter_ of the law, while the
     _spirit_ of it shudders at the toleration of such excesses.

     "The purposes for which this fair was held by its original tenure
     were of a nature directly opposite to those to which it is now
     prostituted. They went to the encouragement of industry by the
     previous manufacture, and subsequent sale, of necessary articles;
     but they are now made subservient to corrupt the public mind by
     the most abandoned, and dissolute, manners. The motley multitude
     that infests the fair, are the more audacious in their conduct,
     from knowing that they are warranted in their proceedings, at
     least by the _appearance_ of law, which sanctions this annual
     ribaldry.

     "We seriously lament, that this 'congratulation[22] of living
     vapours' so foul and pestilential to society, should be suffered
     to exist in the metropolis, and that the Chief Magistrate of the
     City of London should be annually compelled to degrade his
     dignity as the principal guardian of the public peace and morals,
     by going in state, to license a scene, which constantly
     terminates in the most fatal abuses."--(_Times, Sep. 5, 1796._)

     respectable inhabitants thereof, of a nuisance that has prevailed
     from time to time on Wormholt Scrubs by bull-baiting, to the
     great annoyance of the neighbourhood, and the disturbance of the
     public peace, when the Magistrates came to the laudable
     resolution of issuing warrants to the High, and Petty, Constables
     of the Division, requiring them to exert their utmost endeavours
     to prevent the same in future. And, having understood that many
     Publicans within their division had conveyed beer, and other
     liquors, from their respective houses to Wormholt Scrubs, where
     they had retailed it during such bull-baiting, they determined
     not to renew their licences."--(_Times, Sept. 8, 1796._)

     tents, and exposed about 30 men, women, and children, in the
     primitive state of man. They carried them to prison, to be dealt
     with according to the Vagrant Act.

     dined at Norwood, were looking out of a window, they observed a
     respectable, well-dressed woman in deep consultation, for a sum
     paid to the old gypsey. They observed the good woman greatly
     agitated, and heard her ask 'If she was sure it was true'? On
     being answered 'As sure as God was in heaven' she gave the gypsey
     a further sum, and made further enquiry, and at last gave her a
     good pocket-handkerchief, and departed seemingly full of
     vengeance. The gentlemen, curious to learn the nature of the good
     woman's consultation, sent for the old gypsey, who candidly told
     them, that she enquired of her if her husband was continent, and
     that she answered he was not, and thereby obtained three presents
     instead of one."--(_Times, Aug. 22, 1797._)

Partridge shooting began on 14th September then, instead of the 1st

     "FOURTEENTH OF SEPTEMBER.

     "Bemired up to the knees, wetted from head to foot by the
     incessant rain, fatigued and disappointed, the Cocknies yesterday
     returned from their annual field-sport, with very little game
     indeed. A detachment from Cheapside, which had filed off early in
     the morning, toward Hampstead, with the locks of their
     fowling-pieces wrapped up in their handkerchiefs, were so galled
     by the rain, that they got no further than _Old Mother Red
     Cap's_, where they diverted themselves all day with firing from a
     window at some Dutch-pins in the skittle ground. One of these
     pins was mortally wounded in the belly by Ensign _Tight
     Breeches_, a man milliner's foreman, who drove a ball into it, at
     the amazing distance of two yards, without letting the gun fall
     out of his hand.

     "Six journeymen weavers, from Spital-fields, who went in a chaise
     cart, to Ealing, with two guns, were rather more fortunate, in
     respect to Game. They killed a lame hen at Acton, shot one goose
     on the Common, wounded a large sow, and filled their pockets and
     Game-bags with turnips, and cabbages. They imagined they sprung a
     pheasant near Gunnersbury House,--but it proved to be an old
     turkey-cock. At Eleven, they returned, very wet, and very drunk,
     having lost one of their guns, and broke the stock of the other,
     by flinging it at a tame rabbit, in a farmer's yard.

     "Four _gentlemen_ from Leadenhall-Market, who went on the
     long-coach to Woolwich, as there are partridges in that part of
     Kent, killed two crows in Hanging-Wood Lane, blinded a jackass
     near the Warren, and wounded a sparrow, several feathers being
     perceived to drop from its wings. They had tolerable good sport
     with a bat, their terriers being of an excellent breed, and
     having worried a flock of ducks in a ditch, and killed one, they
     returned from _Partridge shooting_ about nine at night, very much
     fatigued indeed.

     "Five gentlemen who went sporting from Kent Bar to Lewisham,
     notwithstanding the wetness of the day, had tolerable good luck.

     "They belonged to the Trained Bands, and depended more upon their
     bayonets, than their guns. At the Half-Way-House they killed a
     fine buck-cat, as he was watching a chaffinch. From the
     Half-Way-House to New-Cross Turnpike, every sparrow was
     affrighted by the noise of their guns: but the rain by this time
     having completely wetted the locks, and damped the powder, they
     were obliged to charge with bayonets, and every tree bore marks
     of their prowess, to the Lion and Lamb at Lewisham, where they
     dined, got drunk, killed two hogs, and a Chinese sow, and, in the
     evening, were carried home by the Lewisham stage.

     "St. George's Fields, once the mart of London sportsmen, being
     now almost covered with houses, very few prentice-boy gunners
     were seen there. The birds which now inhabit that quarter, are
     many of them jail-birds, and if the new Magistrates were to sport
     their authority a little more than they do, they might bring down
     some of the most dangerous game with which a neighbourhood was
     ever infested.

     "Very few were the sportsmen on Blackheath, to the great joy of
     sheep and jackasses, and to the safety of stage-passengers, who
     were often endangered by the random shot of those _one-day_
     sportsmen. As to partridges, their lives were in no danger, not
     one of those sportmen out of fifty knowing the difference between
     a partridge and a crow; besides, as their dogs are generally of
     the bull-dog kind, of the terrier, or the fox breed, the game are
     in very little danger of injury from their ability."--(_Times,

"In respect to the quantity of their allowance, we state, on the most

half a pound of good fresh beef, _every day in the week_, together
with a full proportion of vegetables. A subsistence which thousands of
our own poor would be glad to have."

     make advances for the maintenance of French Prisoners, has had

     forward with the necessary supplies, and as the French agents
     have now the whole management of this concern, we shall no longer
     be subject to their odious calumnies against the humanity of this
     country.

     The number of French prisoners in England, amounts to about
     22,000; the Dutch prisoners are about 2,500. The daily cost of
     these men, since the French agents had the charge of them, has
     been £1,370 sterling a day (about 1s. 1d. each): and their annual

     he has done (and that gratis) to the amount of some hundreds, the
     whole of which number have done well, not one patient excepted.

     his feet, I escaped death, and even cast_rat_ion, in the
     conside_rat_ion that I belong to your worthy f_rat_ernity, and
     upon condition that I should inform you of certain truths,
     however g_rat_ing. Since the discovery of the conspi_rat_ors,
     your o_rat_ions have not been unde_rat_ed, for they have not been
     _rat_ional. If your treaty with them has been _rat_ified, you
     will be well sc_rat_ched, and so forbear p_rat_ing for the
     present. Besides it is a deside_rat_um that you should have
     nothing to say to Mr. G_rat_tan, and that you should not
     Co-ope_rat_e with the Irish-Ma_rats_. Let your nar_rat_ions
     concerning _Rat_isbon, or _Rat_stadt, be mode_rat_e, and
     endeavour to make repa_rat_ion for all the nonsense you have
     talked, and the mischief you have not ope_rat_ed. Sequest_rat_e
     yourself with your vene_rat_ed old Aunts, and deal out _rat_ions
     of oatmeal, and cheese, to your p_rat_ing b_rat_s, whom everybody
     commise_rat_es, and arbit_rat_e between cowherds, and bullock

     by the bulk of bullocks, try next to run down your successor in a
     race of amelio_rat_ed _Rats_. Full of admi_rat_ion, and great

     "We are sorry to hear that the _Rat_ that wrote the famous
     letter, was cruelly murdered by the enraged servants. The _Rat_
     is now said to have been over-driven, and made mad in Downing
     St., in order that he might scratch the Knight into the
     _Cat_-aphobia. He anxiously expects the _cat_-astrophe. The
     _Rat_'s letter has very much exaspe_rat_ed the Worthy Baronet to
     whom he addressed it."--(_Times, June 8, 1798._)

     "Colonel Twiss, and other officers of the engineers, have been
     employed by government to examine a proposition made by a Mr.
     Dodd, for forming a _tunnel under the River Thames_, from
     Gravesend, to Tilbury."--(_Times, July 16, 1798._)

     "_Tower Hill_ is soon to lose that name, and, in compliment to

They knew how to puff--in those days:--

     "Advt.--Thirty Thousand Pounds gained for Five shillings, without
     a Lottery. A Gentleman of the Navy had, for some time, been
     paying his addresses to a Lady of Fortune, and gained her
     affections: being suddenly ordered off to the West Indies, the
     marriage was deferred until his return. On arriving at St.
     Domingo, he was attacked by the Yellow Fever, which appeared
     externally in scabby eruptions, arising from living in too free a
     manner in that destructive climate, which disfigured his face so
     much, that, on his return to England, the Lady was disgusted, and
     broke off the match. This turn so affected the Gentleman that a
     slow nervous fever resulted, which reduced him so low that his
     recovery was despaired of. Fortunately, an officer of the Guards,
     his intimate friend, calling on him, told him he thought the
     perusal of Dr. Brodum's Guide to Old Age would be of service:
     and, in consequence, purchased a Guide for five shillings, which,
     with the aid of the Dr.'s Botanical Syrup, completely restored
     him, and on calling on the Lady after his recovery, she was so
     well-pleased at his healthy appearance, as to immediately consent
     to unite herself with him, and make over a fortune of
     £30,000."--(_Times, Nov. 20, 1798._)

       *       *       *       *       *

     "A story is told at Brighton of a certain Baronet having been
     most cruelly imposed upon by some young Bucks, at that place, who
     sent him a pretended letter from the wife of a Dentist,
     requesting a tender interview. The Baronet flew to her lodgings
     on the wings of love, but the first person he met was her
     husband. The Baronet, with a ready attention to professional
     circumstances, said he came to ask advice for the _toothache_:
     the operator rejoined, that an extraction was the most certain
     cure, and the unfortunate Baronet actually submitted to an
     incision in his jaw, to save the rest of it from being
     broken."--(_Times, Nov. 30, 1798._)

       *       *       *       *       *

     "This being the first day of May, Mrs. Montague will give her
     annual entertainment of roast beef, and plum-pudding, to the
     Chimney-sweepers of the Metropolis, in the court yard of her
     house in Portman Square, in commemoration of discovering her
     child among them, long after it had been trepanned
     away."--(_Times, May 1, 1799._)

       *       *       *       *       *

     "The donations given by Mrs. Montague, of Portman Square, every
     May-day, proceed from pure benevolence towards the distressed
     poor. The story, which has been generally believed, of her having
     once lost a child, who was trepanned from her house, is wholly
     unfounded."--(_Times, May 2, 1799._)

       *       *       *       *       *

     "The Lady Mayoress is in the straw, and the _Bambino_, according
     to the customs of the City, is to be rocked in a cradle of solid
     silver. This is a very ancient privilege, and, as it costs the
     City about Five Hundred Pounds, the Aldermen will probably look
     twice, before they elect family men again with their wives in the
     family way."--(_Times, July 1, 1799._)

What occasioned the following?

     "Such senseless extravagance as _eating Bank notes_ has not been
     known since the French Courtezan, who curled her hair with them:
     or the days of Cleopatra, who swallowed a jewel as a rich
     repast."--(_Times, Aug. 22, 1799._)

The singular belief that used to obtain, and still is prevalent,
especially among the lower classes, that a man might sell his wife to
any bidder, provided that he did so in open market, and with a halter
round her neck, was in full force at the latter end of the 18th
Century. That this belief has not died out may be seen in an article
on "Wife Selling," by my brother, in "All the year Round" 20th Dec.
1884, in which he cites cases as recently as 1862, 1870, 1881--and two
in 1882--in one of which, the wife was sold for a glass of ale, and
the other, for a penny and a dinner.

     "By some mistake, or omission, in the report of the Smithfield
     Market, we have not learned the average price of wives for the
     last week.

     "The increasing value of the _fair sex_ is esteemed by several
     eminent writers as the certain criterion of increasing
     civilization. Smithfield has, on this ground, strong pretensions
     to refined improvement, as the price of Wives has risen in that
     market from half a guinea, to three guineas and a
     half."--(_Times, July 22, 1797._)

       *       *       *       *       *

     "An Hostler's wife, in the country, lately fetched _twenty-five
     guineas_. We hear there is to be a sale of wives soon at
     Christie's. We have no doubt they will soon _go off_
     well."--(_Times, Sept. 19, 1797._)

       *       *       *       *       *

     "On Friday a butcher exposed his wife to sale in Smithfield
     Market, near the Ram Inn, with a halter about her neck, and one
     about her waist, which tied her to a railing, when a hog-driver
     was the happy purchaser, who gave the husband three guineas, and
     a crown, for his departed rib. Pity it is, there is no stop put
     to such depraved conduct in the lower order of people."--(_Times,
     July 18, 1797._)

       *       *       *       *       *

     "On Saturday evening last, John Lees, steel-burner, sold his wife
     for the small sum of 6_d._ to Samuel Hall, fell-monger, both of
     Sheffield. Lees gave Hall one guinea immediately, to have her
     taken off to Manchester the day following by the coach: she was
     delivered up with a halter round her neck, and the clerk of the
     market received 4_d._ for toll. It would be well if some law was
     inforced to put a stop to such degrading traffic!! (Sheffield
     Register)"--(_Times, March 30, 1796._)

       *       *       *       *       *

     "At the last sale of wives there was but a poor show though there
     were plenty of bidders. One alone went off well, being bought by
     a Taylor, who outbid eight of his competitors."--(_Times, Dec. 2,
     1797._)

       *       *       *       *       *

     Advt. "To the Curious. J. Harrison begs leave to inform his
     Friends, and the Public, that he has, for sale, a great variety
     of grafted Gooseberry Plants, in pots, with red, white, and black
     Currants growing on each, the fruit of the finest flavour: and
     handsome standard Currant Trees, 5 feet high, with red, white,
     and black, fruit on each, likewise dwarf Apple Trees, handsome
     plants, suitable for the borders of pleasure gardens, being full
     of fine fruit. Gentlemen and Ladies are invited to come and view
     his plants, now the fruits are on them, at his Nursery, opposite
     the Turks Head, half-way to Deptford Upper Road."--(_Times, Aug.

     "When the order for the embargo was received at Gravesend, two
     hoys, the one for Margate, the other for Ramsgate, lay off the
     town, and were immediately subjected to the restriction. One had
     nearly 200 persons on board, the other, upwards of 150; they were
     obliged to land, and the place not affording accommodation for so
     large, and unexpected, an influx of company, a whimsical scene of
     confusion, disorder, and embarrassment, ensued: some in carts,
     &c., got on to Rochester, and Canterbury: but, owing to the
     march, and embarkation of troops, all the carriages, and horses,
     on the road were engaged, and several days elapsed before these
     unfortunate people reached the place of their
     destination."--(_Times, Aug. 19, 1799._)

       *       *       *       *       *

     "Lately died at Lynn, in her 78th year Miss Mary Breese. She
     never lived out of the parish she was born in, was a remarkable
     sportswoman, regularly took out her shooting license, kept as
     good greyhounds, and was as sure a shot, as was in the county. At
     her desire, her dogs, and her favourite mare, were killed at her
     death, and buried in one grave."--(_Times, Oct. 8, 1799._)

       *       *       *       *       *

     "Late on Sunday evening last a beautiful Circassian arrived at
     the Turkish Ambassador's Hotel. She was brought from Smyrna in
     the '_Princess_,' Capt. W. Lee, as a present from the Grand
     Seignior to his Excellency the Ambassador. She is peculiarly
     elegant, and beautiful, and was escorted hither by six black
     eunuchs. The Ambassador showed great attention to Capt. Lee on
     account of the care he had taken of his mistress."--(_Times, Dec.
     19, 1799._)

       *       *       *       *       *

     "The _fair Circassian_ has not yet made her appearance in public.
     A very splendid equipage is now building in Long Acre for her.
     Several of our dashing young men of fashion have offered
     themselves as drivers to the Eastern beauty."--(_Times, Dec. 24,
     1799._)

I have not been able to trace the fate of this lady--she was only a
nine days' wonder in fashionable society.

from the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the manager of
the Project Gutenberg™ trademark. Contact the Foundation as set
forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg™ collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg™
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain “Defects,” such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate

intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

of Replacement or Refund” described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg™ trademark, and any other party distributing a Project

LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you

with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you “AS-IS”, WITH NO

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement

limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg™

Project Gutenberg™ is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg™'s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg™ collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg™ and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non-profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg™ depends upon and cannot survive without
widespread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg™ electronic works

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg™ concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg™ eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg™ eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This website includes information about Project Gutenberg™,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.

FOREWORD


This play came to us late in the season of 1926-1927. Produced by
George Auerbach at the American Laboratory Theater in New York, it
attracted some attention during April and May, and survived without
serious damage the ordeal of criticism by several of the front-line
reviewers. With two or three exceptions, however, the notices showed
little understanding of what Mr. Riggs was trying to do.

That is one reason why I am presuming to add these few words to the
dramatist’s text. _Big Lake_ is that rarest of things, a poetic drama
that is at once poetry and drama. To one of his later plays Mr. Riggs
has given the title _Sump’n Like Wings_, and I can think of no words
that so accurately describe what I felt when, over a year ago, I
read the manuscript of _Big Lake_. There is a winged lightness in
the words that the poet puts into the mouths of his young people, an
ecstasy born of the sheer joy of being alive. How poor a thing is the
mere “observation” of a clever playwright beside the deeper, more
incisive and highly intuitive scenes in _Big Lake_!

In calling Mr. Riggs a poet (I refer here not to his formal
verse-making, but to his plays) I am not forgetting that poetry in
the theater is a different thing from the poetry you read in a book:
Mr. Riggs’ plays are stage pieces; the poetry in them is never a
matter of mere words, but an integral part of the speeches uttered
and the gestures made by the characters, directing each scene and
permeating the whole. It lies first in the writer’s conception of a
harmonic entity, and floods it from beginning to end.

Mr. Riggs’ three full-length plays are the work of a young man who
is still close enough to his youth to remember and understand those
fleeting moments of exaltation and depression that constitute the
glory and the tragedy of adolescence. In _Big Lake_, more especially
than in _A Lantern To See By_ and _Sump’n Like Wings_, Mr. Riggs has
been able on occasion to look at the world about him through the
eyes of a child: can you not feel in the second scene of the first
act something of the wonder and terror of the more wildly romantic
stories of the Brothers Grimm?

If this Foreword were a study, I should go on to point out how
Lynn Riggs has taken the folk-material and the idiom of his native
district and skillfully made of them a rich medium of expression,
and explain how, with only the slightest technical manipulation, he
has reproduced the subtle rhythms of everyday speech. Then I should
also have to take him to task for an occasional awkwardness in the
management of his plots. But my purpose here is not to criticize:
it is to point out to you a new American dramatist, whose work is
permeated by an odd and strangely haunting beauty.

  BARRETT H. CLARK.

BIG LAKE




THE WOODS


SCENE 1

  (_The woods adjoining the Big Lake, near Verdigree Switch, Indian
  Territory, 1906. It is Spring. Vines creep on the trees just
  putting out their green. The ground is soft with dead leaves,
  among which grow the earliest flowers. A fallen log lies in a
  tangle of last year’s briars. It is the grayness of morning. Color
  is beginning to show in the East, where the lake lies, and as
  the light grows the lake shines through the leaves._ LLOYD _and_
  BETTY _come from the left, softly over the matted earth. They are
  very young._ LLOYD _is tall, dark; he has black hair; his face is
  sensitive; he wears rough shoes, dark trousers, and a pale blue
  shirt._ BETTY’S _hair is yellow. She has let it down. It frames her
  white, delicate face. Her dress is a coarse dark slip._)

LLOYD

It’s been s’ gray.

BETTY

It’s gettin’ lighter.

LLOYD

It’s been s’ gray. But now it’s gettin’ lighter and lighter—even to
clear back here in the woods.

BETTY (_softly_)

I c’n feel the dawn.

LLOYD

_I_ c’n feel the dawn. I c’n _see_ the dawn! Look! Through the trees!
Whur the lake’s at! The Big Lake’s a-shinin’ like a tub full o’
soap-suds! I’m glad we come. Ain’t you, Betty?

BETTY

I’m glad we come early.

LLOYD

I’m glad we come. (_They stand a moment breathless at the beauty
before them._) Le’s set down. (_They sit at left._) The horse is tied
up. Grub’s safe in the buggy. Miss Meredith ’n’ the rest of ’em won’t
be here fer a long time yit.

BETTY

They’ll be here, though.

LLOYD

Yeow, but it’ll be a long time. Won’t Miss Meredith be supprised to
find us here ahead of everbody? It was _my_ idee. She’ll think we’re
purty smart.

BETTY

How many’s comin’?

LLOYD

The whole class, I guess—’cept the Davis boy. It’ll be a nice day
to picnic, won’t it? (_He rises and goes away from her and looks
out toward the Lake. Softly, then more and more ecstatic, like a
prayer_—) I alwys liked the Big Lake. I’ve come here many’s the
time with Paw, when we’d went out to git some cattle. Miles and
miles through the bilin’ heat, tongue clawin’ at yer mouth—a-eatin’
dust, mebbe we’d go. Dust bilin’ up and blindin’ you—a-gettin’ in
yer mouth and eyes till you thought you couldn’t stand it. An’ then
the dark woods here—briars a-clawin’ at yer legs and hands, rattlers
a-hidin’ under the leaves mebbe, logs t’ make yer horses jump, and
branches ye’d have t’ dodge. Then the lake—flowin’ wide out—plum over
almost out o’ sight—a-settin’ thar in the sun like sump’n you never
hoped t’ see! I’d alwys want t’ git off my horse and go down to the
edge of it—and tech it—and look at it—a long time. But Paw ud alwys
say, “Set thar a-gawkin’, you kid. We got to git back to the sawmill
’fore 2 o’clock,” or he’d say, “’Tother end o’ the Lake is dried up
purty good, son. We could cross over thar ’stid o’ goin’ round by
the section line.” (_After a moment._) I ain’t never seen it like
this, though. It’s purtier’n I ever seen it. And we c’n look at it
’s long’s we want to. And we c’n go out on it—in a boat—if they is a
boat—

BETTY (_timidly_)

Why don’t you come over here and set down by me?

LLOYD

Why don’t you come over here and look at the lake?

BETTY

I c’n see it good—from here.

LLOYD

Come on over the big log, and you c’n see it better.

BETTY

No. I like it here better.

LLOYD (_puzzled_)

You’re funny. Set over thar then. I like you thar jist as well. You
look purty good no matter whur you’re a-settin’. You _set_ purty
good. I like you settin’ thar with the vine leaves and the tree
leaves behind you. You’ve got purtier and purtier, Betty.

BETTY

Have I? You’re sweet to say it.

LLOYD

Why wouldn’t I say it?

BETTY

No reason not to. I like to hear it.

LLOYD

Words git in the way some. I cain’t think t’ say much.

BETTY

They’s no need t’ say much—

LLOYD

They _is_ need to. Seems t’ me yore comin’ to Verdigree wuz like
you’d come from some place besides down the river. It made me think
of the Bible—sump’n about the angel that come down to roll away the
stone—

BETTY

You wuzn’t dead.

LLOYD

I uz asleep, I wuz. I uz young-asleep. I uz boy-asleep. I’m awake
now. I’m a man. I’ve come to life.

BETTY

You’d think I uz an angel—sproutin’ wings!

LLOYD

You’re better’n an angel—

BETTY

I ain’t!

LLOYD

You air, too, to me. Better’n an angel! I’ll put this flower in yer
hair—

BETTY

No.

LLOYD

’S like a star.

BETTY

No, no. Whur’d you git it at?

LLOYD (_puzzled_)

Why, _here_.

BETTY (_strangely_)

Under the leaves. It growed up through the dead leaves. I don’t like
it—

LLOYD

Why, Betty!

BETTY

I cain’t stand them kind of flowers.

LLOYD

’S jist a flower. Growin’ in the woods.

BETTY

In the dark woods. Lloyd—

LLOYD (_puzzled_)

Whut is it?

BETTY

Lloyd, le’s go away frum here—

LLOYD

Whur’d you want to go to?

BETTY

Out of here, out of these woods! (_Pleading for him to understand._)
Oh, you think I ain’t right. I cain’t expect you to know how I feel.
They’s sump’n—I don’t know what it is— Please! It’s like the woods
wuz waitin’—

LLOYD

Like a animal.

BETTY

To git us. To git us! I’m afeard. They’s things growin’ here—an’
fightin’. They’s things crawlin’ on the ground, under the ground—in
the trees—everwhur! I’m afeard!

LLOYD

_I’m_ afeard!

BETTY

Lloyd!

LLOYD

I’m afeard, too! Le’s go—

BETTY

Whur’ll we go to?

LLOYD

Out on the lake.

BETTY

They’s no boat.

LLOYD

Futher down—they’s a cabin, I know, and a boat—mebbe. Come on—le’s
go to it. (_They start._ LLOYD _stops, shaking off his fear_.) Aw,
listen. Whut’s the matter with us? Runnin’ like rabbits. They ain’t
nuthin’ to be skeered of. We’re jist cold, that’s all. That’s it.
Drivin’ so long ’fore it got light has jist got us chilled to the
bone.

BETTY

I ain’t cold.

LLOYD

Y’air. Cold as ice. Ye’re tremblin’.

BETTY

I’m afeard!

LLOYD

We’ll go the cabin, then. It’s safe thar.

BETTY

And git the boat and go out on the lake?

LLOYD

We’ll git warm first.

BETTY

No! No! Le’s not go to the cabin. Le’s go on the lake.

LLOYD

Why, Betty! I never seen you like this!

BETTY

I never been like this. Come on, to the Lake—

LLOYD (_patiently_)

Now, Betty, to the cabin first. Why, you’re _cold_! They’ll be a
fa’r a-burnin’ thar. I doan know who’s a-livin’ thar, but we’ll go
up and knock, and ask t’ git warm. They’ll be up. Country folks git
up early. And they’ll have a fa’r—a nice roarin’ warm fa’r in the
fa’rplace fer us to git warm at. Won’t you like that?

BETTY

Mebbe—

LLOYD

It’s the funniest kind o’ cabin you ever see. It’s a log cabin. I
been in it a long time ago with Paw. It’s a nice log cabin. An’
they’ll have a fa’r.

BETTY (_reluctantly_)

Well, I’ll go—if you think—

LLOYD

Frum the outside it looks jist like any log cabin. But when you open
the door, and look in—whut do you see? Steps! Three steps a-goin’
down to the dirt floor. It’s part under the ground—

BETTY

Oh! Like it growed up out o’ the ground—?

LLOYD

Yes, jist like that! Like it growed out o’ the ground!

BETTY (_with conviction_)

It growed out o’ the ground. It growed out o’ the same ground the big
woods growed out of! (_She shudders._)

LLOYD

Yeow.

BETTY

Le’s don’t go thar!

LLOYD

Jist long enough to git warm.

BETTY

No, not that long!

LLOYD

And to ask ’em fer the boat—if they got a boat.

BETTY (_desperately_)

Couldn’t we jist take the boat—’thout asking?

LLOYD

Betty! Course we couldn’t!

BETTY

I don’t see why, I don’t see!

LLOYD (_laughs_)

We ain’t thieves.

BETTY

_I’d_ be one.

LLOYD

No, you wouldn’t. Come on.

BETTY

To the Lake?

LLOYD

To the cabin first.

BETTY

Lake!

LLOYD (_firmly_)

No, Betty, cabin! (_They go out, right._)


_Curtain_




THE WOODS


SCENE 2

  (_Interior of the cabin. At the back three steps descend from the
  planked door to the dirt floor of the cabin. Windows, curtained,
  are on either side of the door. They are so high up that only a
  tall man can see out. A wide fireplace made of stone rises from
  the floor at the right end of the room. In the left corner of the
  cabin, a wide double-deck bunk juts out. Crazy quilts cover both
  beds. A few chairs, a rough table (set for breakfast at right of
  steps) and utensils for cooking at the fireplace—complete the
  furnishings. A fire burns in the fireplace; coffee bubbles on a
  little iron stand on the hearth. It is dark and gloomy; no direct
  sunlight has ever reached this secret place._

  ELLY, _a tall, dark woman of thirty-five, stands tensely by the
  corner of the bunk. Her face, even in her excitement, is brooding
  and restrained. Her thick black hair, parted in the middle, is
  done up in a knob at the back of her head. She is wearing a faded,
  predominantly purple, plaid dress—full-sleeved, full-skirted,
  pulled in at the waist. After a moment she goes swiftly to the
  fireplace, pokes the fire, then goes across to the window nearest
  the bunk, and with extraordinary agility and grace steps upon a
  chair under the window and looks out. She gets down, goes slowly
  toward the fireplace. In the center of the room she halts, wheels
  about and faces the door. It opens. A man comes in quickly, and
  closes the door as if shutting something out. He turns, facing her
  from the top of the steps. He is of medium height, brutal, crafty.
  His clothes are nondescript and unclean. His hair slants into his
  eyes._)

ELLY

Butch! Thank God! I didn’t see ya— (_She makes a step toward him._)

BUTCH (_quickly_)

Shet up!

ELLY

Butch, w’at is it?

BUTCH (_in a hoarse whisper_)

Shet up, I tell you! Squawkin’ like a hen. You wanta git me killed?
(_In a low voice._) They follered me.

ELLY

Tell me—w’at is it—?

BUTCH

I’ll show ’em! They won’t git me. I’ve got away frum better men ’n
they are. They won’t git me alive—the lousy bums! I’d like to see
’em! They follered me. I been at the Switch. An’ when I started
back I seen three men a-follerin’. They’ll come here. (_He stops
thoughtfully._) They ain’t got nuthin’ on me. They cain’t prove
nuthin’— (_In a hard, matter-of-fact voice._) They don’t _know_ it’s
me done it. They only got somebody’s word. They don’t know it, and
they cain’t prove it. No one saw me—

ELLY (_with foreboding_)

Butch, I knowed this ud come. I knowed it. You’ll git sent up. And it
ain’t right. You ain’t done nuthin’ wrong. It’s jist a law. W’at the
hell’s a law? W’at’s it good fer? Why’n’t it agin the law everwhur
else to sell whiskey? Them men whur they have their corner saloons
all polished up—a-makin’ it criminal to sell a man a drink—w’at’s
right about it? (_With scorn._) Oh, yes! I know. Pertectin’ the
Indians! They don’t want the Indians to git all lit up like _they_ do
all the time—ever day, ever night, regular. (_With disgust._) Hell!
Indians! I ain’t saw two Indians since I come to Indian Territory.
Now they’ll git you. I’ve knowed it. They’ll stick you fer sellin’
the stuff to the poor fools that’s too skeered, and too weak, and too
damn big a cowards to go up to Kansas City or Joplin and bring in
their own whiskey, like a man. They’ll send you to jail—the only man
that’s got guts enough to do it. You’ll git ten year or more. W’at’ll
I git? I’ll git off—that’s w’at I’ll git. I’ll git left here to rot!

BUTCH

Shet up! (_He goes up the steps and listens intently. Then he comes
down._) Let up on yer jail stuff. You’ll have me skeered. And I got
to keep my senses. Listen t’ me. I been follered before. The last
bunch o’ guys laid in wait close to the Holler whur the whiskey’s at.
Did that stop me frum gettin’ the whiskey and gettin’ out with it?
Did that stop me frum sellin’ it regler to Joe Hurd’s Curio Store
at Claremont? I been follered lots o’ times and you know it. I been
follered lots o’ times ’count o’ selling whiskey. It ain’t nuthin’
new to me. But this time I’m follered and it ain’t on the ’count o’
whiskey! They’s sump’n else....

ELLY

Butch! You got to tell me! W’at is it, w’at’ve you done?

BUTCH

Easy, easy!

ELLY

You wuz skeered! I never see you like that before. You’ve done
sump’n. Tell me w’at it is. W’at’ve you done?

BUTCH

Lay off, take it easy....

ELLY

Butch....

BUTCH

Christ’s sake! You’re a mad womern! Keep yer shirt on! Mebbe I ain’t
done _nuthin’_. Mebbe I jist been foolin’ myself. Mebbe—for all I
know, they ain’t nuthin’ to git excited about.

ELLY (_suddenly_)

Butch! You got blood on yer coat! (_She stands a moment, terrified._)
You’re hurt! Why’n’t you tell me? Quick, lemme fix it—I didn’t know.

BUTCH

I ain’t hurt.

ELLY

You’re bleedin’.

BUTCH

It ain’t my blood. (ELLY _draws back, her hand at her face,
confused_.) I killed a man.

ELLY (_sickened_)

Oh! (_With terrible conviction._) You’ll hang fer it, Butch Adams!
Why’d you go and do it? Who wuz it?

BUTCH (_begins in a hard voice, but becomes more and more excited_.)

Jim Dory. He told on me fer sellin’ whiskey. He told the federal
officers at Tulsy. I killed him. Stuck a knife in him and turned
it around. That’s why I went out at midnight ... to lay fer him. I
knowed he’d go to the play-party over t’ Binghams. I laid fer him in
the big woods close to the sawmill here. He’d go that a-way home, I
figgered. About three o’clock this mornin’ he come along in a buggy
with one horse to it. I jumped out and grabbed the bridle. He lep’
out on me with a knife. I got a-hold of it. I stuck it through his
ribs and turned it around. Then I got skeered. They might think I
done it ... findin’ him so close t’ here. It wouldn’t do to find him
so close. I picked him up and dumped him in the buggy and give the
horse a crack with a stick. He started off in a run down the road.
But not afore I’d saw Jim kinda raise up one of his hands to his
face! He wuzn’t dead. I hadn’t made shore! He wuzn’t dead, and he’d
tell on me! He’d tell some one ’fore he died, and I’d hang fer it!
I thought mebbe I could ketch up and finish the job. But the horse
run like mad, crashin’ through the bushes but keepin’ purty close to
the road. I run and run after him—almost to the Switch. Then I seen
some one come out of the store whur a light was burnin’, and grab
the horse’s bridle. I seen him take Jim up and carry him in and shet
the door. I run away then. I didn’t know if he wuz dead or not. If
he wuzn’t, he’d tell on me! I wuz crazy—not knowin’ if he wuz dead
or not. I come on to the woods. I couldn’t stand it not knowin’: I
started back. When I got to the edge of the woods I seen three men
comin’ up the road. I knowed one of ’em! It wuz the Shuruff. They
musta wired to Claremont fer him. Jim ’d _told_ on me! Elly! Whut’ll
I do? They’ll git me! (ELLY _goes over to the fireplace, in her
absorbed way, without speaking, and pours some water in a pan_.)
Elly! They’ll be here any minute! Fer God’s sake, say sump’n!

ELLY

Yer breakfast’s ready.

BUTCH

Elly!...

ELLY

Take off yer coat. (_He does, like one in a daze._) Throw it under
the bunk. (_He does so._) Wash yer hands. (_He moves toward the pan
slowly and begins to wash his hands. She has gone to the table with
the coffee pot and poured some coffee. He finishes washing and dries
his hands on a towel._) Set down. (_He moves toward the table._)

BUTCH

But, Elly....

ELLY (_imperiously_)

Set down! And eat yer breakfast,—Mister Murderer! (_He sits._ ELLY
_leans over the table_.) Eat a plenty. Drink—here’s coffee. Salt
pork, gravy, potaters—eat ’em! Enjoy yerself!

BUTCH (_half rising_)

Whut’re you meanin’! I hadn’t oughta done it? Whut’d you want me to
do ... let him git away with it, let that dirty little coward sneak
off to Tulsy and sick the officers onto me like bloodhounds ’n do
nuthin’ about it? That ain’t my way! If some one does me dirt he gets
his, you c’n count on it! I ain’t no Christian: I’m a man!

ELLY (_with infinite scorn_)

_You_—

BUTCH

I’m a man. Let up!

ELLY (_goes away from him. Bitterly._...)

You’re lower’n I thought you wuz. I never thought t’ be livin’ with a
murderer. (_He comes toward her._) Oh, I ain’t so good. I know. You
don’t have t’ tell me. But I never thought t’ come t’ this. I thought
I knowed w’at I uz gettin’ into when I went away with you. I knowed
you uz a bootlegger. I didn’t keer. It’s clean. It’s right. But
killin’ ... I stop at killin’! Why’d you go and do it? Why _did_ you?
Now they’ll come and take you. They’ll take you away from me!

BUTCH

Christ’s sake, shet up! They’d a-took me away fer bootleggin’.

ELLY

No, they wouldn’ta! They couldn’t ’a’ proved it. But now they’ll take
you. They’ll hang you fer murder. (_She clings to him._) No, I won’t
let ’em! They _cain’t_ take you! I love you—I cain’t help it. ’N I
won’t let ’em take you away frum me! I won’t let em! I’ll find a
way! I will! They ain’t proved you done it ... you said no one seen
you....

BUTCH

They got Jim’s word, I tell you....

ELLY (_calmer_)

He’s dead. He cain’t talk now.

BUTCH

Sh—! I heerd sump’n! (_Excitedly—drawing his pistol._) They won’t git
me!...

ELLY

Gimme that gun!

BUTCH

... Not’s long’s I’m alive!

ELLY

Butch! Give it t’ me! I’m all right now. I ain’t never advised you
wrong. I’ll git you outa this! Listen t’ me: you ain’t been outa the
house, y’hear—not since yistiddy. Eat yer breakfast! (_She goes to
the window, steps on the chair, and looks out._) It’s only a man an’
womern....

BUTCH

It’s a _blind_!

ELLY

No, no! (_Coming down._) It’s jist a boy and girl—a couple o’ kids.

BUTCH

Keep ’em out!

ELLY

No! We’ll let ’em _in_! It’s Providence!

BUTCH

It’s a blind, I tell you....

ELLY

It’s luck! It’s our luck. Mebbe we c’n use ’em....

BUTCH

How?

ELLY

Some way. I doan know yit. Gimme the gun. (_He hands it to her,
reluctantly._) Keep yer head. These two’ll come in. They’ll keep you
frum hangin’, Butch Adams! (_She goes swiftly to the bunks, and hides
the pistol under the quilts._ BUTCH _goes back to the table and sits.
There is a moment of intense silence. Then a knock._) Come in!

  (LLOYD _and_ BETTY _come in. They look very slight, very delicate,
  in this somber place._)

LLOYD (_awkwardly_)

How’d do?

ELLY

Howdy.

LLOYD

You got a fa’r we could git warm at?

ELLY

Over thar.

LLOYD

If it ud bother you— If we’d be in yer way.

ELLY

It won’t bother me. Nuthin’ gits in my way. You’re welcome. Come in,
an’ git warm if you want to. (_They come down the steps slowly._ ELLY
_turns to the window_.) I’ll git you a cheer.

  (LLOYD _and_ BETTY _turn, and are about to go to the fireplace
  when_ BUTCH _rises from the table where he has been sitting. They
  see him for the first time and stop in alarm._)

ELLY (_quickly_)

Butch, bring a cheer up. (_He picks up a chair and sets it in front
of the fireplace._ LLOYD _and_ BETTY _watch him anxiously. He goes
across to the bunks and sits down._ ELLY _crosses over with another
chair._) Here’s another cheer. Set down. (_They go over slowly and
sit._) The fa’r’s goin’ strong. Mebbe you’d like a cup of hot coffee?

LLOYD

Would you, Betty? (_She shakes her head._) No, ma’am. Thank you.

ELLY

I guess you’ve had yer breakfast.

LLOYD

No’m, we ain’t yit. We’re gonna have it ’s soon’s Miss Meredith comes.

ELLY

Who’s Miss Meredith?

LLOYD

Our teacher.

ELLY

Oh! Over t’ the Switch.

LLOYD

Yes’m. It’s a picnic breakfast here in the woods—fer the whole class.

ELLY

Oh! (_After a moment._) You’ve come awful early.

LLOYD

Nobody’s come yit—but us. We come early.

ELLY

How’d you happen to do that?

LLOYD (_hesitating_)

Why, we—we jist thought we’d come early. We drove over from the
Switch. Horse and buggy’s up here a ways—not fur.

ELLY

Oh! (_She looks from one to the other. Then to_ BETTY.) Air you
gittin’ warm, Miss?

BETTY (_gratefully_)

Yes’m. I wuz cold.

LLOYD

She wuz tremblin’.

ELLY

You’d oughta wear more clothes when you go out s’ early.

BETTY

Yes’m.

ELLY

Yer Maw ud oughta told you.

BETTY

Maw’s dead.

ELLY

Yer Paw ud oughta told you, then.

BETTY

He’s asleep. (_The three smile at this._ LLOYD _and_ BETTY _begin to
feel more at ease_.) This is the first time I been out s’ early. I
didn’t know it wuz cold. Now I know. ’Fore it gits sun-up it’s li’ble
to be. Even after sun-up it’s apt to be cold here in the woods, ain’t
it?

BUTCH (_suddenly_)

Elly! Ain’t you got a coat you could let her borry?

ELLY (_surprised_)

Why, yes, I got a coat. (_To_ BETTY.) I’ll lend you one.

BETTY

No’m, you mustn’t. I’m obliged to you, but I doan need it.

ELLY

You shore?

BETTY

Yes’m.

  (BUTCH’S _interruption causes a constrained silence_. ELLY _goes
  away toward the bunks thoughtfully_. BETTY, _uneasy, looks at_
  LLOYD. _Then_ BUTCH _rises, crosses the room, takes the poker and
  stirs the fire. He goes back to the little table and sits down._
  LLOYD _rises, makes a step toward_ ELLY.)

Mebbe we better go now—

BUTCH (_loudly_)

Set down! (_He begins eating his breakfast._)

ELLY (_quickly_)

He ain’t had his breakfast. Don’t mind him.

LLOYD

We better go.

ELLY

He don’t mean nuthin’.

LLOYD (_uneasy_)

Well, we’ll stay a minute or two. (_He goes back and sits down._)

ELLY (_as if nothing had happened_)

Must be fun to come a-picnickin’ in the woods.

LLOYD

I doan know. I ain’t never been.

ELLY

I ain’t been since I uz yore age. _Why_ ain’t you been?

LLOYD

I’ve always worked, helped my Dad drive cattle—till now. I’m in
school.

ELLY

And ain’t never been to school before?

LLOYD

No, ma’am.

ELLY

And ain’t never went on picnics?

LLOYD

Not till now.

ELLY

I used to go all the time when I uz yore age. In Kansas City. Woods
wuzn’t fur away. Used to go—a whole crowd of us—ever Sunday. Set
on the ground ... real ground, ’stid o’ pavement ... with grass
a-growin’ out of it. First I’d ever saw. We thought it wuz fine.
You’ve missed a lot.

LLOYD

Yes’m. I guess so. But I’ve had fun. I been out with Paw a
lot—drivin’ cattle. He buys ’em up differnt places—Verdigree, Foyil,
Sageeyah, even ’s fur away’s Pryor Crick. Nen we saddle up our
horses’n go out ’n drive ’em in to ship to the market at St. Louis.

ELLY

W’at’s fun about drivin’ cattle? Sounds like work t’ me.

LLOYD

Well, it’s work. And it’s fun, too.

ELLY

In winter, looks like you’d freeze yer ears off....

LLOYD

We don’t drive ’em much in winter.

ELLY

Well, in the summer then, ’n the spring: I doan see w’at’s fun about
the scorchin’ heat ’n the dust ’n the hot wind. I’d wanta be in out
of it. I’d wanta be under a roof whur the sun didn’t hit me....

LLOYD

Sun’s bad. Dust’s bad, too. Wind ain’t so good. But they’s sump’n
else....

ELLY

Yeow? W’at is it?

LLOYD (_going across to her_)

I doan know ... it’s kinda crazy....

ELLY

I had a crazy brother.

LLOYD (_smiling_)

Well, it ain’t as bad as that.

ELLY

My brother wuzn’t bad. Jist wuzn’t right. He used to run out in the
woods here like he uz wild. He lived here with us. He done queer
things.

LLOYD

This is queer too. You’ll laugh. You see, when Paw and me goes out t’
drive cattle, some time or other we pass by the Big Lake.

ELLY (_strangely_)

The Lake?

LLOYD

Yes’m. Sometimes it’s early ... when we first start out frum the
Switch. Sometimes it’s the middle of the day—when we’ve got back frum
Grand River. Sometimes it’s night. But we alwys pass by it—some time
or other.

ELLY

I doan see w’at’s fun about it. I been livin’ here three year. I c’n
see the Lake any time. They’s no fun to that.

LLOYD

I cain’t explain it very well. It’s nice—nice t’ see it. ’N no matter
whur you’re at, whut time o’ day it is, it’s nice to know the Lake’s
thar. ’N it’s nice to know ’at some time mebbe you’ll git a chance to
go out on it. I ain’t never been. I alwys want to. (_Smiling._) Kinda
crazy, ain’t it?

ELLY (_thoughtfully_)

Yes.

LLOYD

I told you it wuz.

ELLY (_slowly_)

You’re not the only one.

LLOYD

The only one whut?

ELLY

Crazy. They’s others. I’ve saw ’em. Do you ever read the newspapers?

LLOYD

Why, no’m—I—

ELLY

Cain’t read?

LLOYD

Well, not much. But I’m gonna learn better.

ELLY

How long you lived at the Switch?

LLOYD

Alwys lived thar.

ELLY

Then you musta heerd of people gettin’ drownded in the Lake?

LLOYD

Yes’m.

ELLY

Crazy. Why’d they go on it?

LLOYD

’Tain’t the Lake’s fault. It’s their’n.

ELLY

Yeow. Fer goin’ out on it.

LLOYD

No. Fer keerlessness. Some of ’em fall in. Some of ’em turn the boat
over. Sometimes the boat leaks....

ELLY

Yeow. But if they didn’t try to go out on the Lake, the boat wouldn’t
leak, the boat wouldn’t turn over, ’n they wouldn’t fall in. It’s
their fault fer goin’!

LLOYD

But people will go out on it. People want to. It ain’t wrong.

ELLY

No. ’Tain’t wrong. ’N people will do it. That’s the trouble: they
will do it. ’N do you know who it is does it? D’you know who it is
that’s alwys gettin’ drownded in the Lake? People like you—young
people—like yerselves—picnickin’! My brother—he got drownded out
thar—a month back. We never did find him.

  (BUTCH _has risen to put a log on the fire_. BETTY _shrinks away
  from him as he goes near her_.)

BUTCH

Warm now?

BETTY

Yes, sir. (LLOYD _goes over quickly, anxiously_.) We better go,
Lloyd. I’m warm. I’m plenty warm.

LLOYD

Well, we’ll go then. (_To_ BUTCH.) Thank you, Mister— Thank you fer
the fa’r. (_He turns toward_ ELLY.) I wuz goin’ t’ ask you if we
could borry yer boat. I doan know now if I want to....

BETTY (_quickly, nervously ... to_ ELLY)

You got a boat, ain’t you?

ELLY

Yes.

BETTY

Let us borry it ... awhile? Please! Let us borry it!

LLOYD (_to_ BETTY)

You still wanta go on the lake?

BETTY

Yes. I do. (_To_ ELLY.) Please. Cain’t we take it fer a while?

ELLY

I doan know—I ain’t so shore....

BUTCH (_suddenly_)

Borry it! Borry it all you want to! Here’s the key. (LLOYD _takes
it_.) Bring it back when you git ready. Oars is over thar by the
door.

LLOYD

Thank you. (_To_ ELLY.) Thanks fer the f’ar. (LLOYD _and_ BETTY _go
toward the steps. He picks up the oars. They go up the steps._ LLOYD
_turns to_ ELLY.) The oars seem to be good. The boat—don’t leak, does
it?

ELLY

No, it don’t leak.

LLOYD (_smiling_)

Well. I’m keerful. Betty’s keerful. We’ll make out all right, I guess!

  (_They go out._ ELLY _looks sharply at_ BUTCH. _He turns back to
  the table and sits down. She follows him over._)

ELLY (_sharply_)

Why’d you do it?

BUTCH

Do whut?

ELLY

Give ’em the key. Give ’em the oars.

BUTCH

Why, to git rid of ’em. I didn’t want ’em here. It uz you wanted ’em.

ELLY

You’re lyin’. Why’d you do it?

BUTCH

I told you.

ELLY

That wuzn’t it. You got some reason.

BUTCH

You had a reason fer lettin’ ’em come in, too. You said you did,
anyway. Well, what wuz it?

ELLY

I thought we could use ’em....

BUTCH

Use ’em! How could we use ’em?

ELLY

I guess we cain’t....

BUTCH (_scornfully_)

No, ’course not! You never had no idee of it. You wuz jist talkin’....

ELLY

I did have an idee. I thought—when I seen ’em outside ... they might
be a way of throwin’ the blame onto that boy, someway....

BUTCH (_rising—excited_)

Elly! You thought of blamin’ him with....

ELLY

Yes. ’Fore I _seen_ him, I did. After he come in, I knowed we
couldn’t.

BUTCH

Why not?

ELLY

I wouldn’t have the nerve—to try to throw it onto him. Mebbe it ud
work all right, mebbe it could be done. They’s ways of makin’ fools
outa the law.... Oh, I know, I’ve done it many’s the time ... an’ we
could git suspicion on this boy someway. And he’d hang too—innocent
and all! But I cain’t do it, I wouldn’t think of doin’ it....

BUTCH (_harshly_)

Well, why wouldn’t you?

ELLY (_frightened_)

Butch! Fergit I said it, fergit I ever thought of sich a thing.

BUTCH (_grimly_)

I’m glad you thought of it.

ELLY

W’at’d you mean?

BUTCH

I mean—it’s an idee.... I wouldn’t a-thought of it. I c’n see, I
c’n see a way—you’re a smart womern, Elly.... Wait a minute, lemme
think....

ELLY

No! You cain’t do it. W’at’re you thinkin’ of?

BUTCH

Why not? D’you want me to hang?

ELLY

No.

BUTCH

Shet up, then! The officers’ll come here. Whut’ll I tell ’em ...
whut’ll I say—they’ll come in the door—this boy—he’ll be out on the
lake by that time....

ELLY

Butch! Butch!

BUTCH

Shet up!

ELLY

You cain’t plan to do this! I won’t let you git that boy killed. He’s
too young, he’s too sweet-lookin’....

BUTCH

Ha! Ain’t I young? Ain’t I sweet-lookin’? You’ve said so. ’D you mean
it?

ELLY

I come here—and lived with you.

BUTCH

So’d Lilly. So’d Marge. ’N whut’d they do? Lilly on her death bed
a-damnin’ me—I c’n hear her yit. Marge—she tried to give me up to the
law. I fixed her. Hell! They both come here, ’n lived with me. That
don’t prove nuthin’. You got to prove it some other way. You got to
help me....

ELLY

I’ve helped you—bendin’ over yer f’ar, cookin’ yer victuals, washin’
yer clothes, makin’ the beds you’ve slep’ in. I’ve helped you ...
livin’ in this damp cellar like a mole with no sunshine a-comin’ in
and no moonlight ever. I’ve tended you when you uz sick, I’ve lied
fer you, I’ve buried myself away frum all the decent folks I ever
knowed—here in these dark woods fer three year. Why’d I do it? Why
_did_ I? It’s proof you want, is it? Then look at me, Butch Adams!
_I’m_ proof! Look at me! I uz young when I come here with you three
year ago. I uz young—like that little girl that uz here jist now. I
wuzn’t as purty as her, but I uz young like her. Look at me now!

BUTCH

You’re talkin’. You’re puttin’ words together. Whut good are they
to me? They won’t save my neck frum hangin’. You got to help me. If
you got to talk, tell me whut to do. The Shuruff’ll be comin’ here.
Whut’ll I say to him? They ain’t nuthin’ to say to him, unless you
help me. I got a plan—

ELLY

Not that boy!

BUTCH

You got to help me. They don’t keer who they hang in this country.
One man’s as good as another fer hangin’. _They_ don’t keer. But _I_
do! I keer fer hangin’. It’s got to be some one else.

ELLY

Not that boy!

BUTCH

That _boy_! It’s got to be him! It’s got to be him killed Jim Dory—

ELLY

They’ll never b’lieve he done it.

BUTCH

They’ll believe it—

ELLY

Jim Dory must’a’ told ’em ’fore he died who done it—

BUTCH

That don’t prove it. My word’s as good as his. Jim might’a’ made a
mistake; in the dark woods he couldn’t see so well ... not even if it
ud been daylight. Mebbe—some one else done it—

ELLY

Not that boy!

BUTCH

That boy, I tell you!

ELLY

No, Butch, no!

BUTCH

Shet up!

ELLY

I cain’t let you. You doan know w’at you’re doin....

BUTCH

Doin’? I’m savin’ my neck, that’s whut I’m doin’!

ELLY

You’re losin’ it. If you git that boy hung, you’re hangin’ yerself!

BUTCH

You’d tell on me! Damn you, I’d oughta kill you!

ELLY

Kill me then! Coward! Don’t you know if I done w’at’s right, I’d tell
on you now? I’d give you up to the law fer the brute you are, an’ let
you hang as you’d oughta hang! Why don’t I? (_Bitterly._) Yes, why
don’t I? ’Cause I’m a fool, that’s why! I’m like all the women in the
world that’s ever lived: I ain’t good, I ain’t decent, I ain’t even
honest except to one man! I hate you!

BUTCH

Oh, you do, eh? Well, whut is it you mean, then? If I get that boy
hung, how’ll that be hangin’ myself?

ELLY

Wuzn’t you ever young?

BUTCH

Whut’s that got to do with it?

ELLY (_pleading_)

Wuzn’t you ever jist startin’ life? Wuzn’t you ever innocent and
good, and wantin’ to go out into the world and expectin’ it to be
kind to you?...

BUTCH

No!

[Illustration: STELLA ADLER AS “ELLY”]

ELLY (_softly_)

Then you won’t understand. This boy is that a-way. You cain’t kill a
thing like that. If you killed him, you’d be killin’ w’at uz good in
you once ... if they uz ever anything....

BUTCH

You’re preachin’. Let up! Whut’d you think this is? It’s got to be
the way I say, Elly. If I wanna save my neck, I got to throw the
blame on some one else....

ELLY (_triumphantly_)

Not that boy! I’ll tell you _another_ reason why! If you’d a-looked
at him, you’d know the reason yerself! Anybody, even the Shuruff
a-lookin’ at him would know that that boy couldn’t do nuthin’ wrong,
he couldn’t kill a man....

BUTCH

Elly!

ELLY

He couldn’t even hurt any one’s feelin’s! And _besides_,—his story’s
as good as yourn. They’d know w’at he said wuz the truth! You got
to try some other plan, Butch. You got to try to get away. You got
to sneak out in the woods an’ hide a day or two. I’ll take you grub
t’ eat some way. Then when things blows over more we’ll light out
fer Texas till they fergit all about us. You could hide close to
the old sawmill some’er’s. They’d never think o’ lookin’ there fer
you—so near—so near whur Jim—Hurry up, now! (_She crosses and gets
his gun._) You ain’t got much time. Take yer gun. Don’t use it unless
you have to—promise me! I want you to be safe. (_She offers him the
gun._)

BUTCH (_thoughtfully_)

No. Put the gun back....

ELLY

Butch!

BUTCH

You tuck it away frum me once....

ELLY (_frightened_)

You’re not gonna give yerself up? Butch, no! You’ll be hung!

BUTCH

You said they’d never b’lieve that boy done it, eh?

ELLY

Yes. They won’t. They’ll know he couldn’t.

BUTCH

An’ they’ll b’lieve him, eh? His story’ll be better’n mine, eh?

ELLY

They’ll know it’s the truth.

BUTCH

I b’lieve you.

ELLY

Then why don’t you go—before the Shuruff comes?...

BUTCH

I ain’t goin’!

ELLY

You ain’t givin’ yerself up? Butch, you mustn’t! It’s wrong of
me to say it. You’ve broke the laws, you’ve sold whiskey, you’ve
killed a man—you’d oughta suffer fer it. But you mustn’t! You got to
go—quick—they’s time! I’ll leave you grub ever’ day by the foot-log
that’s been washed up by the Crick. I’ll keep a lookout. When it’s
safe—

BUTCH

I ain’t goin’. I ain’t gonna give myself up, neither. I got a plan.
(_Fiercely._) An’ if you try to bungle it, if you try t’ put yer nose
in, or even open yer mouth, I’ll kill you, d’ you hear! You know I
will, too!

ELLY

W’at’re you gonna do?

BUTCH

Put that gun back. Put it back, I say!

  (_She crosses reluctantly, and is putting the gun back in the bunk.
  The door is kicked open, viciously. Three men with pistols in their
  hands eye them from the high threshold. It is the_ SHERIFF _and his
  deputies_.)

SHERIFF (_nervously_)

Two of ’em. Keep yer eye on the womern, Plank. (_To_ BUTCH.) Put
’em up! (_The men come down into the room. The_ SHERIFF _is a
florid-faced man, with a long mustache_.) Search him, Joe. (JOE
_comes over, makes a quick search of_ BUTCH, _and finds nothing_.) No
gun, eh? Make shore, Joe. We doan wanna take no chances.

JOE

They ain’t none, Shuruff.

SHERIFF

All right. Keep yer gun on him. (_To_ BUTCH.) Guess you know whut we
want you fer, Adams. Yer name’s Adams, ain’t it?

JOE

_Butch_ Adams, Shuruff.

SHERIFF

You’ve killed a man.

BUTCH

I doan know whut you’re talkin’ about. Come bustin’ into my house
this a-way. Whut right’ve you got?

SHERIFF

Dry up.

BUTCH

You got a warrant?

SHERIFF

Warrant, hell!

BUTCH

You got no right here. I oughta shoot you down.

SHERIFF (_laughs shortly_)

Shoot! Whut’ll you shoot with? Strikes me as funny you got no
shootin’ iron on you an’ you jist murderin’ a man in cold blood—

BUTCH

I never! I doan know whut you’re talkin’ about—

SHERIFF

We won’t argy with you.

BUTCH

Show me yer warrant.

SHERIFF

They ain’t no warrant.

BUTCH

I’ll have the law on you.

SHERIFF

_I’m_ the law! Le’s go. ’S funny about you havin’ no gun—I doan
understand it—

PLANK (_suddenly—to_ ELLY)

Stand whur you air. Git away from that bunk. Lemme see whut you’re
a-doin’— (_He turns back the cover and finds the pistol._) So that’s
whut you’re up to, eh?

SHERIFF

Whut is it, Plank?

PLANK

She uz reachin’ fer a gun. I thought they uz sump’n funny when we
come in. She seemed t’ be a-bendin’ over like she uz huntin’ sump’n—

SHERIFF (_taking the pistol_)

So that’s it? (_To_ BUTCH.) Didn’t have time t’ git hold of it, did
you? ’S lucky we kicked the door open—

ELLY

He didn’t do it.

BUTCH

I ain’t been outa the house—

ELLY

Don’t you take him! He ain’t done nuthin’!

BUTCH

I ain’t done nuthin’. (_Significantly._) If Jim Dory said my name—

SHERIFF

Jim Dory, eh? Who said anything about Jim Dory? I guess you’ve told
on yerself!

BUTCH

I never!

SHERIFF

You’ve fixed yerself now! Look around, Joe. I’ll watch him. They
oughta be evidence, too.

  (JOE _begins his search of the room, over by the bunks. He crosses
  to the fireplace._)

JOE

Don’t see nuthin’.

BUTCH

You won’t find nuthin’—

JOE

Here’s a pan! Bloody water, Shuruff!

SHERIFF

Le’s see it—

JOE (_bringing it over_)

He washed his hands.

SHERIFF

You got ’em bloody, did you—puttin’ Jim back in the buggy? Oh, he
told. He had time to git out a word or two afore he died. Well, we
got evidence. We got you now whur we want you—

BUTCH (_slowly_)

Shuruff—I’ll tell you—

SHERIFF

It’s time you told me.

BUTCH

I’ll tell you who done it. My brother—he done it.

ELLY

Butch!

BUTCH

He’s crazy. He runs wild here in the woods. He ain’t right—

SHERIFF (_sarcastically_)

Whut’s this?

BUTCH

He lives with us—my brother— You must’a’ heerd of him.

PLANK

I’ve heerd of a crazy boy here in the woods, Shuruff. But that don’t
prove nuthin’. You hear funny stories about these woods here—

BUTCH

Ask Elly!

SHERIFF

’S this crazy boy live here with you?

ELLY (_after a moment_)

Yes.

SHERIFF

’N’ sleeps here?

ELLY

Yes. Sleeps thar. (_She points to the top bunk._)

SHERIFF (_to_ BUTCH)

He’s yer brother, eh?

BUTCH

Yes. Name’s Adams—too, like mine. I’ll tell you. I cain’t pertect
him. I tried. He went out las’ night. I didn’t know why. He goes
out—roams in the woods—all the time. Lately, he’s got to mumblin’
sump’n—like this: “Woods is too full—woods is too full. People.” I’ve
heerd him, ask Elly.

ELLY

Oh, he did—he said that—“People. Too many people. They’s room in the
lake—they’s room thar—they’s room in the lake. It’s big. It’s deep.”
Oh— (_Buries her face in her hands._)

BUTCH

She liked him. He _uz my brother_. Las’ night he went out. He come
in this mornin’ early. It uz him—it uz _him_ killed Jim Dory. He
told me. Met him in the woods—stuck a knife in him. He washed his
hands—they uz blood on ’em. He throwed his coat under the bunk—they
uz blood on it. He went out again.

SHERIFF (_excitedly_)

Whur is he? Whur’d he go to?

BUTCH

Don’t ask me—

SHERIFF

Tell me—quick, whur is he?

ELLY (_in anguish_)

In the lake—that’s whur he’s at.

SHERIFF

In the lake?

ELLY

Drownded.

BUTCH

No—no! No, he ain’t, Shuruff. He’s _on_ the lake.

ELLY (_agonized_)

Butch!

BUTCH

In a boat.

SHERIFF

We’ll git him. He won’t git away!

BUTCH

You won’t git him—not alive, you won’t. You’ll have t’ be keerful if
you even go near him—he’s got a gun!

SHERIFF

We’ll git him!

BUTCH

He’s crazy. He’ll shoot.

SHERIFF

We’ll shoot _first_!

ELLY

Shuruff! No, no! Don’t do it. Don’t listen t’ him.

BUTCH

Be keerful, Shuruff—

SHERIFF

I ain’t skeered of him—

BUTCH

They’s a girl with him—

SHERIFF

A girl—?

BUTCH

He run onto her som’er’s. Mebbe here in the woods. I doan know whur
she come frum—_a young, purty girl_. (_Meaningly._) He’s got her with
him—out on the lake.

SHERIFF

The bastard!

BUTCH

Be keerful. Don’t shoot _her_, Shuruff.

SHERIFF

Whur’s they a boat?

BUTCH

They ain’t but one. He’s in it—him and the girl.

SHERIFF

We’ll get him frum the bank, then. Joe, you stay here. Watch the
cabin—outside. Don’t let these two get outa yer sight. Plank, you
come with me.

  (_The three men go up the steps._ JOE _and_ PLANK _go out_.)

ELLY

Shuruff, you mustn’t do it—they’s a reason—you mustn’t. I’ll tell you—

BUTCH (_quickly_)

He’s my brother, Shuruff. I don’t keer. He’s done wrong. Shoot him
down.

SHERIFF

You’re damn right I will. Like a dog! (_He goes out._)

ELLY (_agonized_)

W’at made you?

BUTCH

You told me yerself—

ELLY

No—

BUTCH

That about yer brother—that put me wise. No one knows he’s been
drownded.

ELLY

Why’d you do it? You could’ve said he got drownded this mornin’.
They’d a-b’lieved it. Why’d you say he wuz on the lake?

BUTCH

I got reasons.

ELLY

W’at air they?

BUTCH (_evilly_)

You musta noticed, Elly—a girl wuz here with that boy. They’d come
here together—

ELLY

W’at of it?

BUTCH

The horse and buggy’s up here a ways. She’s young, she’s purty— They
drove here together. She’ll need some one to drive her home—through
the woods—

ELLY

Ugh! You beast!

BUTCH

(_He goes toward the steps._) Mebbe I am one. Mebbe I am a beast. And
this place we’re livin’ in—whut’s it? It’s the woods, Elly. It’s the
dark woods. (_He goes up the steps._)

ELLY

Butch! (_She hurries after him._)


_Curtain_




PART TWO




THE LAKE


SCENE 1

  (_A cleared place on the bank of the lake. At the back, beyond a
  slight mound, the lake begins. Willow trees droop into the water.
  Gold sunshine touches the lake, plays over an old boat tied under
  a tree. Voices—excited, boisterous, rough—shatter the quiet. From
  the left the picnic party enters, singly, in groups of three,
  in pairs—a dozen or more people. Tall farm boys, red-handed,
  red-faced, dressed in battered overalls, clumping shoes, ragged
  shirts; short, round farm girls, in unbecoming calicos and
  ginghams, with bows in their hair. Some of the boys carry boxes of
  food._)

BOYS AND GIRLS

I cain’t carry this no fu’ther.

Whur’s the f’ar go?

Fu’ther down, I reckon.

Over thar’s a good place.

She’s a-gettin’ her sewin’ done now, the crazy fool, an’ the Fair six
months off!

Aw, she cain’t sew a-tall.

Guess she aims t’ git married.

Married? Huh! Wouldn’t no one have _her_!

Would too have me! Lem Sickles ud have me.

He’d _have_ you, all right, ’f you’d give him a chanst!

BUD BICKEL (_loudly_)

Le’s play, le’s stop a minute!

BOYS AND GIRLS

Hey, Miss Meredith!

Shet up yer yellin’! Miss Meredith’ll take yer head off.

Whut if I call her Jessie?

You better hadn’t! Arclo went ’n’ called her Jessie, ’n’ you orter
_seen_ her! She slapped him—!

BOYS AND GIRLS (_protesting_)

I’m hungry!

Aw, c’m’on ’n’ do whut Bud says!

Miss Meredith won’t let us, I bet.

Fraidy cat! Shootin’ on it, Clem, quit steppin’ on my feet, you crazy!

Le’s play! Keep yer feet in yer pocket!

BUD

Le’s play “Little Brown Jug.”

BOYS AND GIRLS

I’m hungry!

Well, who keers if you air? _Be_ hungry! So’re we.

Who’s gonna cook the meat? Who’s got the meat? Whur is the meat
anyhow? It’s bacon, ain’t it?

Shore, it’s bacon. (_Singing._) “Sow belly bacon ’n’ bean soup!”

Le’s play “Happy is the Miller Boy.” I’ll be it.

BUD

Aw, le’s play “Ole Joe Clark.” C’m’on! Irey! Git _her_! Git Hildie
fer a pardner. Well, you’re it, then. Irey’s it! Everbody got a
pardner?

BOYS AND GIRLS

Wait a minute!

Go ahead. You start it, Bud. “Ole Joe Clark”—

  (_They begin to play, singing the song as they “do si do,”
  promenade, etc._)

    “Ole Joe Clark’s dead an’ gone,
     I hope he’s doin’ well.
     He made me wear the ball and chain
     Till my ankles swelled.

      “Rock, rock, ole Joe Clark,
       Rock, rock, I’m gone,
       Rock, rock, ole Joe Clark,
       Good-by, Lucy Lawn.

    “I wouldn’t marry a yellow gal,
     Tell you the reason why—
     Cross-eyed tears run down her back
     When she starts to cry.

     “Rock, rock, ole Joe Clark” (_etc._)

BUD (_alone—loudly_)

    “I wouldn’t marry a yellow gal,
     Tell you the reason why—
     Her neck’s so long an’ stringy,
     I’m ’fraid she’d never die.”

BOYS AND GIRLS (_joining in the chorus_)

    “Rock, rock, ole Joe Clark” (_etc._)

(MISS MEREDITH _enters at left. She is sharp and prim. Some of the
boys shout to her, while the chorus goes on_:) C’m’on, Miss Meredith,
’n’ play.

MISS MEREDITH

No, I won’t play.

A BOY

It’s fun.

MISS MEREDITH

It’s time to eat. Hurry and finish.

BUD (_alone—loudly_)

    “I wouldn’t marry a yellow gal,
     Tell you the reason why—
     She’d blow her nose in yellow corn-bread
     An’ call it punkin’ pie!”

BOYS AND GIRLS

    “Rock, rock, ole Joe Clark—”

MISS MEREDITH (_sharply_)

Quit it! Quit it! (_The chorus stops._) That’s no way to act! Those
verses are not very nice, Bud Bickel.

BUD

Aw, whut’s the matter with ’em?

MISS MEREDITH

Never mind, you’re not to sing them. They’re bad taste.

BUD

Ha! Bad taste? Verses don’t _taste_, Miss Meredith. They ain’t no
taste to ’em, ma’am. ’N’ if they is, they all taste alike!

MISS MEREDITH

Not another word out of you, Bud Bickel! It’s time to be cooking the
breakfast, anyway. You can play afterwards.

BUD

Aw, let us play one more!

BOYS AND GIRLS

One more ’fore we go—

He didn’t mean nuthin’.

It’s still early. Betty and Lloyd ain’t here yit.

Betty and Lloyd ain’t come.

It’s time t’ eat, anytime.

Gosh, she tole him—

Please, Miss Meredith—?

MISS MEREDITH

Oh, very well. You may play “Drop the Handkerchief.”

A BOY

Aw, that ain’t a play-party game.

MISS MEREDITH

This is not a play-party.

BUD

Le’s play “Straight Across the Hall.” That’s a _game_. It ain’t got
no verses. C’m’on. Miss Meredith, you be my pardner. C’m’on!

MISS MEREDITH

I don’t play.

BUD

I’ll teach you how. ’S easy’s fallin’ off a log.

MISS MEREDITH

No.

BUD

Please, jist onct! Then we’ll go, ’n’ make a f’ar, and git breakfast!

MISS MEREDITH

Just once, then.

BUD (_leading her over_)

Miss Meredith’s gonna play.

BOYS AND GIRLS

Gee!

Hey, it’s a good game!

You won’t mind it s’ much, ma’am.

’F anybody steps on you jist kick ’em, Miss Meredith! That’s the way
a lady do. (_They form a circle, and begin to sing and play._)

    “Straight across the hall to the opposite lady,
     Swing her by the right hand,
     Swing yer pardner by the left,
     An’ promenade the girl behind you.

      “Oh, that girl, that purty little girl,
       The girl I left behind me,
       I weeped an’ cried t’ the day I died
       Fer the girl I left behind me.”

MISS MEREDITH (_suddenly_)

Stop it!

BUD

Whut’s the matter?

MISS MEREDITH

Stop it, Bud Bickel! (_She crosses over right, angrily._) We won’t
play any more.

BUD (_following her over_)

Whut is it, whut’ve I done?

MISS MEREDITH

You’re swinging the Waist Swing, Bud Bickel!

BUD

Well, o’ course!

MISS MEREDITH

It’s wrong. It’s wicked. I’m ashamed of you. I’m surprised at you.

BUD

Why, ma’am, I do that all the time. I swing all the girls the Waist
Swing.

MISS MEREDITH

The idea! Don’t you know it’s wrong?

BUD

No’m.

MISS MEREDITH

It is. Don’t you ever do it again, you hear me? And don’t you girls
ever let me catch you letting a boy swing you by the waist instead of
by the arms. Come on, now! We won’t wait any longer.

A BOY

But Lloyd and Betty ain’t here yit—

MISS MEREDITH

We’ll not wait, I say! Hurry up now! (_She goes out._)

BOYS AND GIRLS

She’s on her high horse!

Aw, it’s too early yit to eat. Sun’s jist riz—

Hey, she tole it to you, Bud!

Ain’t you a nice sight—a-swingin’ the girls—

BUD

Shet up!

A BOY

You he-devil you, Bud Bickel! You waist-swingin’ son of a gun! Come
on ’n’ swing some meat over the f’ar ’n’ see how you like that!
(_They all go out, laughing._)

  (_After a moment_, LLOYD _and_ BETTY _enter from the left_. BETTY
  _goes hurriedly toward the boat and is about to get in_. LLOYD
  _stops_.)

LLOYD

Betty— (_She turns._) Betty, they jist went. I guess they’re ready t’
eat, now—

BETTY (_shaken_)

I don’t keer—

LLOYD

Aw, you mustn’t be excited about nuthin’—

BETTY

I ain’t excited.

LLOYD

Yes, you air, too. I c’n tell the way you act. You see—they wuzn’t
nuthin’—

BETTY

No—

LLOYD

Nuthin’ a-tall. They uz nice folks. (_Trying to reassure her._) Funny
place t’ be a-livin’ in though—buried under the ground, like. Looks
like it ud be damp s’ close to the lake. But they uz nice folks. Nice
womern. The man uz all right. Kind of a lumberin’ kinda man—’thout no
talk—but kindhearted. Didden he loan us the boat?

BETTY

Yes—

LLOYD

Didden he give us the oars? Shore he did! Well?—

BETTY

Le’s go on the lake now, Lloyd—

LLOYD

Shore! We’ll go, all right. I said we’d go. (_He goes toward her.
She gets in the boat. A burst of song and laughter comes from the
picnickers some distance away. He raises his head._) Betty, listen!
They’re gettin’ breakfast ready, I guess.

BETTY

I don’t want none.

LLOYD

All right, I ain’t s’ hungry. But I’m jist wonderin’—wh’er we hadn’t
oughter let ’em know we’ve come. I told Bud Bickel we uz comin’ early
by ourselves. They might wonder about us—or wait fer us.

BETTY

They won’t wait. They’re startin’ a f’ar.

LLOYD

Smoke’s a-rizin’ good. It’s a-comin’ off the ground an’ rizin’ up
like a cloud. We oughter be thar. Miss Meredith might worry about us.

BETTY

She wouldn’t worry about us. She wouldn’t worry about no one. Please,
Lloyd, le’s go out on the lake—a little while, jist fer a little—

LLOYD (_anxiously_)

Whut is it?

BETTY

Nuthin’—

LLOYD

Tell me—

BETTY (_with sudden passion_)

Oh, _them_! That cabin! Them people! That man! I’m afeard of him,
he’s a part of these woods here! He’s part of this. I don’t like it.
It’s busy, busy a-doin’ sump’n I can’t understand! They ain’t nuthin’
clear t’ me. Why’d he look at me that a-way? Why’d he want me t’
borry a coat t’ keep warm? Why’d he stir up the f’ar—fer _me_? Why
did he?

LLOYD

Why, Betty, he uz only bein’ nice t’ you. He liked you. People like
you—you’re sweet, you’re purty—

BETTY

No. It ain’t that! It’s sump’n else. I don’t understand it. I’m
afeard. I’m too young. It’s wrong t’ be young—

LLOYD

Betty! Why, here—

BETTY

His eyes a-burnin’— His teeth—like a animal’s—

LLOYD

Betty!

BETTY

He’s a _part_ o’ these woods here! He b’longs here. I don’t. I
don’t b’long here. You don’t. We’re too young. They’s sump’n goin’
on—sump’n mean—sump’n awful—It ain’t fer us t’ be part of. We got to
git away—

LLOYD

We’ll go on the lake.

BETTY

Oh, yes, we’ll go on the lake! (_Thoughtfully._) Nen whur’ll we go to?

LLOYD

_Acrost_ the lake—or down to the other end. We c’n git a snack t’ eat
at Binghams. We’ll do that ’n’ then row home. We won’t come back here
t’ the woods if you don’t want to—

BETTY

We couldn’t jist stay—in the middle of the lake—awhile?

LLOYD

Course we could—fer a while. But you’d be hungry. You’d be cold out
thar too after a while. The wind blows—

BETTY (_fearfully_)

All around the lake, everwhur, they’s woods. The lake goes out—’n’
it’s clear thar and bright—but it teches the woods everwhur at the
edges. Oh! They ain’t no place t’ go to! The lake—it teches the
woods—it’s a _part_ of the woods! (_She sinks down._)

LLOYD (_kneeling_)

No! No, it ain’t, Betty. You’re jist upset. It’ll be nice out thar.
It’ll be clear an’ bright. Mebbe it’ll be warm. We’ll stay as long’s
you want to. You mustn’t be this a-way, don’t you see, Betty? Oh,
I know—you’re jist upset, you’ve saw things you don’t understand.
You’ve been skeered. It’s all right now. You mustn’t think
everything’s mixed up like this—like these woods. Out there—look
at it—look at the lake! (_Breathlessly._) Sun techin’ it. Little
waves startin’ in the wind, breakin’ here on the bank in ripples.
Trees—willers leanin’ down like they uz prayin’ at the edges. I wish
I could be a lake. I wish I could be that big, that deep! I wish I
could be ketchin’ the sun like it—an’ sparklin’ an’ singin’—an’ never
afeard o’ nuthin’—jist a-settin’ thar quiet in the sunshine—a-lookin’
up at the sky, a-lookin’ up at the sun—

BETTY (_looking up at him_)

You make it nice—

LLOYD

No, ’tain’t me—

BETTY

You make it nicer’n it is—

LLOYD

No. It looks that a-way t’ me.

BETTY

It’s that a-way t’ me, too—

LLOYD (_relieved_)

Betty—

BETTY

When you say it. You make things nicer’n they air—

LLOYD

No, I make ’em the _way_ they air.

BETTY

An’ the lake?—

LLOYD

It’s a deep pool—

BETTY

It’s quiet.

LLOYD

It moves when the wind moves. It holds the sun. It’s a cup with gold
in it—

BETTY

And dawn—

LLOYD

An’ sunset, and shadders, and starlight, an’ the moon burnin’ red.
Come on, why’d we stay on the bank? We’ll go out— (_He climbs into
the boat._)

BETTY

Yes.

LLOYD

On the lake!

BETTY

I hear sump’n—

LLOYD

’S footsteps. Somebody runnin’—

BETTY

They’re comin’ this way!

LLOYD

Through the woods—

BETTY

Lloyd!

LLOYD

Sh!

BETTY

Le’s go, quick.

LLOYD

Be still! They won’t see us!

  (_A boy rushes in headlong from the woods at the left. He is almost
  out of sight, right, when he catches sight of the two in the boat.
  He stops. His face is coarse; a grin, like an idiot’s, spreads over
  his face. It is the_ DAVIS _boy_.)

DAVIS

Hi!

LLOYD

Hi.

DAVIS

Didden see ya. Betty an’ Lloyd, ain’t it? Whut you doin’?

LLOYD

Nuthin’.

DAVIS

Well. Whur’s Miss Meredith at?

LLOYD

Down the lake. Thought you wuzn’t comin’. Thought you had t’ work.

DAVIS

I did—but I sneaked off. Played hookey frum work—like frum school.
Joke’s on my ole man. He’s keepin’ the shop, he’s shoein’ ole Jake
Wilkerson’s mare— Whut you doin’ here—you two?

LLOYD

Nuthin’.

DAVIS

Settin’ in a boat—by yerselves, ain’t ya? Ha! Havin’ a good time all
by yerselves, ain’t ya? Sweet on each other, ain’t ya? Oh, by Joe!
Wait’ll I tell Miss Meredith!

LLOYD

Shet up yer mouth, Oscar Davis!

DAVIS

Miss Meredith knows yer here, don’t she?

LLOYD

We ain’t saw her this mornin’.

DAVIS

You ain’t? Oh, wait’ll I tell her! Settin’ in a boat—_hidin’_ in a
boat! I wouldn’t a-saw you if you’d a-kep’ yer head down. O gorry!

LLOYD (_gets out of the boat, angrily_)

Whut’re you a-sayin’, you?

DAVIS

Oh, the sweet little babies—a-settin’ in the boat—jist a-settin’ an’
a-settin’ till the night do come. Oh, by Joe!

  (_He runs out, right, laughing._ LLOYD _looks at_ BETTY,
  _disturbed, then walks over left_. BETTY _gets out of the boat
  slowly and goes toward him_.)

BETTY

Lloyd— We better go—

LLOYD

Mebbe—

BETTY

He makes me feel— Oh!—

LLOYD

Don’t mind him.

BETTY

I do mind him. We better go. (_Painfully._) Lloyd, whut is it? Whut’d
he mean?

LLOYD

Oh, don’t mind him—

BETTY

Tell me—

LLOYD

Things. He’s dirty, he’s low—

BETTY

Oh!—

LLOYD

We’ll go whur the others are at. It’s all right. Don’t you mind. Miss
Meredith’ll know it’s all right. She’ll know. Come on. We better go.

  (_They start, right._ MISS MEREDITH _enters hastily, out of breath,
  venomous. She stops in their path._)

MISS MEREDITH

Oh—so you’re here?

LLOYD (_slowly_)

Yes’m.

MISS MEREDITH

A pretty sight! A pretty couple, I must say!

LLOYD

Whut’d you mean?

MISS MEREDITH

The nerve—asking me what I mean! Where have you been all morning—you
two?

LLOYD

No whur. We come here—that’s all.

MISS MEREDITH

_Come_ here! What time did you leave the Switch?

LLOYD

I don’t know. It uz early.

MISS MEREDITH

What time?

LLOYD

I don’t know.

MISS MEREDITH

You don’t know? Before sun-up?

LLOYD

Yes, ma’am.

MISS MEREDITH

Before daylight, wasn’t it?

LLOYD

Yes.

MISS MEREDITH

You left in the dark?

LLOYD

Yes, it uz still dark.

MISS MEREDITH

I thought so!

LLOYD

Whut difference’d it make? I tole Bud Bickel to tell you—

MISS MEREDITH

Oh, he told me! He told me you were coming early—by yourselves—you
and Betty. Why’d you do it?

LLOYD

Why, we wanted to.

MISS MEREDITH

Wanted to! That’s no reason. Why’d you want to?

LLOYD

Why, we wanted t’ be here ’fore it got light t’ see the lake. T’ see
it git lighter ’n’ lighter till the gray mist uz all gone—an’ the sun
had rose—

MISS MEREDITH

Oh, you did? So you had to get up early in the morning—before
daylight—and drive here through the dark woods—by
yourselves—alone—you two? You had to sneak off where there was no one
to spy on you, and no light to make you ashamed of yourselves, didn’t
you? Oh, don’t interrupt me! I know why you did it! I’m surprised
at you, Betty. I wouldn’t have thought it of you! I shall report
you both to the School Board. I’m ashamed! I’m ashamed _for_ you! I
can hardly look any one in the face. I don’t know how you can. Oh,
it’s this that makes teaching so hard! After all my labor, and all
my rules to keep you from going wrong like this—you sneak off to the
woods—the first chance you get—like a couple of animals. I’m ashamed
of you! Come on, now! The fire’s started. Come on and eat your
breakfast! (_She goes out._)

BETTY (_turns away, stricken_)

Oh! Her, too!

LLOYD

Her—an’ everbody! Damn her! Damn everbody! O Christ!

BETTY

It’s all mean—it’s all wicked, wicked! Whut’ll we do now?

LLOYD (_in agony_)

Nuthin’—

BETTY

We _got_ to do _sump’n_!

LLOYD

We’ll go on the lake, then.

BETTY

They’s no place else t’ go—

LLOYD

It’s the _only_ place t’ go. We’d oughta went thar before. Come on,
Betty, git in. (_They get in the boat._ LLOYD _shoves it away from
the bank_.) We c’n go acrost ’n’ git grub—we c’n go home—

BETTY

Home! I don’t want t’ _see_ home again! I hate it! I hate these
woods! They’s no place fer us—nowhur—

LLOYD

They’s room on the lake—

BETTY

Oh, yes! They’s room thar! They’s room on the Lake!

LLOYD

It’s big! It’s deep!

  (_They row out of sight, left. A burst of song and laughter comes
  from the picnickers down the lake. Then there is the sharp crackle
  of twigs, and the noise of running._ PLANK _and the_ SHERIFF _run
  in from the right_.)

PLANK (_pointing off left, excitedly_)

Thar he is, Shuruff!

SHERIFF

(_Draws his pistol as they run off left._)


_Curtain_


THE LAKE

SCENE 2

  (_A cleared place sloping down to the left, where the lake comes in
  in a little bay. The branches of old trees meet overhead. The lake
  glitters in the bright sunlight._

PLANK _and the_ SHERIFF, _with the pistol still in his hand, stand
and shout off left_.)

SHERIFF

Come in, you! Put that boat in to shore!

LLOYD’S VOICE

I won’t— I won’t—

SHERIFF

I’m givin’ you one more chance!

LLOYD’S VOICE

I won’t never do it! You cain’t make me, you cain’t—

SHERIFF

I’ll give you till I count three!

LLOYD’S VOICE

Count ten! Count a hunderd! I won’t come!

SHERIFF (_deliberately_)

One! Two! Three! Comin’?

LLOYD’S VOICE

Never!

SHERIFF (_raises his gun slowly and fires_)

Take that, then! (BETTY _screams_.)

PLANK

You got him, Shuruff! He’s sunk down in the boat like he’s dead! Hey!
Look at it! Look! The girl! She’s standin’ up in the boat! Good God,
she’s jumpin’ in the lake! She’ll drownd!

  (BUTCH _and_ ELLY, _followed by_ JOE, _run in from the right_.)

ELLY (_in horror_)

Shuruff! Shuruff! You’ve killed him! You’ve killed him! (_She looks
off, left._) Oh, the girl—she’s drownin’! Quick, save her—you got
to—go an’ save her, she’s drownin’! (BUTCH _throws off his coat_.)

BUTCH (_muttering_)

Christ! (_He dashes off, left._)

ELLY (_with a moan_)

Oh, w’at’ve you done, w’at’ve you done! (_With bitter scorn._)
You don’t know! You think you’ve upheld the law, you think you’ve
done yer duty! Well, you ain’t! You’ve killed an innocent boy that
wouldn’t hurt a fly—that’s w’at you’ve done! (_She looks left._) Oh,
hurry! hurry! She’s goin’ down! Hurry an’ git her!

SHERIFF

Go help him, Plank. Go help him. Joe, go drag in the boat. Hurry up!
(PLANK _and_ JOE _hurry out_.)

ELLY

Mebbe she ain’t drownded. Mebbe she ain’t—the pore thing— (_She sinks
down wearily. To the_ SHERIFF.) Why’d you stand thar? Why don’t you
do sump’n? (_With infinite scorn, infinite weariness._) Look at him.
He’s the law. He’s done his duty. He’s got his man. He’ll git a
reward.

SHERIFF

Shet up!

ELLY

You cain’t shet me up. I’m a fool not to a-told you before. I’m a
fool too—like yerself—like Butch—like the whole damn world! I _been_
a fool. But I won’t be now. I’ll tell you now—now it’s too late—I’ll
tell you sump’n ’at’ll make yer ears burn, ’at’ll make you sick
inside like sump’n eatin’ on yer heart! Listen t’ me—you! You’re
bright, you’re smart, you’re a keen-smellin’ dog of the law, you’re
the _law_! You pertect the weak, you hang the criminals. _You shoot
down, you murder innocent people—that’s w’at you do!_ (_With a sob._)
It uz Butch, it uz Butch killed Jim Dory....

SHERIFF

Whut’s this!

ELLY

_Butch_, I tell you! This boy ain’t his brother. He never saw him
before. He’s jist a boy, jist a young boy—picknickin’—in the woods—

SHERIFF

Good God! Is this the truth you’re tellin’ me?

ELLY

It’s the truth—

SHERIFF

Godamighty!

  (BUTCH _comes in dripping, carrying_ BETTY. _He puts her down
  gently._)

BUTCH

Drownded—

  (PLANK _and_ JOE _come in carrying_ LLOYD. _They put him down._)

PLANK

You got him, Shuruff—

JOE

He’s dead.

  (_The_ SHERIFF _staggers a little, his hand before his eyes_. ELLY
  _comes down, bends tearfully over the bodies. Then she stands
  erect, wheels and faces the_ SHERIFF.)

ELLY

Ask him!

SHERIFF

Oh—

ELLY

Ask him, Shuruff! Ask him who killed Jim Dory! ’N’ if he lies!—

SHERIFF (_to_ BUTCH)

She says you done it.

BUTCH

She told on me?

SHERIFF

She says you done it.

BUTCH

(_He looks at_ ELLY. _She does not flinch. He looks back at the_
SHERIFF. _Speaks slowly._) I killed him.

SHERIFF

Christamighty! You killed Jim Dory? You killed this boy too, then!
_You_ done it! ’Twuzn’t _me_!

BUTCH (_as if dazed_)

I killed her, too. She drownded herself. I tried t’ save her.

SHERIFF (_horrified_)

How could you do it! Two men—an’ this pore innocent little girl! God!
Why’d you do it? Whut made you?

BUTCH

I don’t know. You’re the law. _You_ tell me! Tell me why I done it!

  (_The picnic party rushes in from the right. They stop. They are
  silent, awed._)

MISS MEREDITH

What’s the matter? I heard shots! (_She catches sight of the
bodies._) Oh! What is it? Lloyd and Betty! Good heavens!

SHERIFF

Dead, Miss.

MISS MEREDITH

Oh, my poor little children! My poor little ones! (_To_ BUTCH,
_gratefully, noticing his wet clothes_.) Oh, you tried to save them!
God will reward you! (BUTCH _turns away_.) Poor little Betty— Lloyd
was good to her. Oh, why’d they go on the lake! Why’d they do it? I
told them not to. (_She turns away, sobbing._)

ELLY (_slowly_)

It’s alwys the way. People _will_ go on the lake. Young people.
Cain’t keep ’em off. ’N’ they’s alwys accidents. Sometimes it’s the
lake, sometimes it’s the woods—boats leak, guns go off, people air
keerless, they’s wild animals—sump’n happens, sump’n alwys happens.
It cain’t be helped.—

DEAR FEN:

You are responsible for some of the incidents in this roaring yarn,
and for that and other reasons it should be inscribed to you--who, in
your own person, lead a life as swaggeringly varied from the
existence of office, home and country-club as any character I have

PORTO BELLO GOLD



CHAPTER I

MY FATHER'S SECRET

I was in the counting-room, talking with Peter Corlaer, the chief of
our fur-traders--he was that very day come down-river from the
Iroquois country--when the boy, Darby, ran in from the street.

"The Bristol packet is in, Master Robert," he cried.  "And, oh, sir,
the watermen do say there be a pirate ship off the Hook!"

I remember I laughed at the combination of awe and delight in his
face.  He was a raw, bog-trotting bit of a gossoon we had bought at
the last landing of bonded folk, and he talked with a brogue that
thickened whenever he grew excited.

"For the packet, I do not doubt you, Darby," I answered.  "But you
must show me the pirate."

Peter Corlaer chuckled in his quiet, rumbling way, his huge belly
waggling before him beneath his buckskin hunting-shirt, for all the
world like a monster mold of jelly.

"_Ja_, _ja_, show us der pirates," he jeered.

Darby flared up in a burst of Irish temper that matched his tangled
red hair.

"I would I were a pirate and had you at my mercy, you butter-tub!" he
raged.  "I'll warrant you'd tread the plank!"

Peter gravely unsheathed his hunting-knife, seized Darby's flaming
locks and despite his wriggles went through the motions of scalping
him.

"If I tread der plank, first I take your hair, _ja_," he commented.

"Not if I had my growth," snapped Darby.

"T'ree growths you must get to fight me, Darby," rejoined Peter
placidly.  "You better ask Mr. Ormerod dot he let you come with me
into the Iroquois country.  We make a forest-runner out of you--_ja_!
Dot's better than a pirate."

Darby contemplated this, drawing a circle on the floor with the toe
of one boot.

"No," he decided finally.  "I'd rather be a pirate.  I know nothing
of your forest, but the sea--ah, that's the life for me!  And sure, a
pirate has more of traveling and adventure than a forest-runner, with
none but red savages and wild beasts to combat.  No, no, Master
Peter, I am for the pirates, and I care not how soon it may be."

"It will be long, not soon, Darby," said I.  "Have you done the
errands my father set you?"

"Every one," answered he.

"Very well.  Then get you into the store-room and sort over the pelts
Peter fetched in.  Even a pirate must work."

He flung off with a scowl as I turned to Peter.

"My father will wish to know the packet has arrived," I said.  "Will
you go with me to the Governor's?  The Council must be on the point
of breaking up, for they have been sitting since noon."

Peter heaved his enormous body erect.  And I marveled, as always
after a period of absence, at his proportions.  To one who did not
know him he seemed a butter-tub of a man, as Darby had called him--a
mass of tallow, fat limbs, a pork-barrel of a trunk, a fat slab of a
face upon which showed tiny, insignificant features grotesquely at
variance with the rest of his bulk.  His little eyes peered
innocently between rolls of fat which all but masked them.  His nose
was a miniature dab, above a mouth a child might have owned.

But under his layers of blubber were concealed muscles of forged
steel, and he was capable of the agility of a catamount.  The man had
not lived on the frontier who could face him bare-handed and escape.

"_Ja_," he said simply.  "We go."

He stood his musket in a corner and slipped off powder-horn and
shot-pouch the while I donned hat and greatcoat, for the air was
still chilly and there was a scum of snow on the ground.  We passed
out into Pearl Street and walked westward to Hanover Square, and
there on the farther side of the Square I spied my father, with
Governor Clinton and Lieutenant-Governor Colden.

And it made my heart warm to see how these and several other
gentlemen hung upon his words.  There had been those who slandered
him during the uproar over the '45, for he was known to have been a
Jacobite in his youth; but his friends were more powerful than his
enemies, and I joy to think that he was not the least influential of
those of our leaders who held New York loyal to King George when many
were for casting in our fortunes with the Pretender.

He saw Peter and me as we approached and waved us to him, but at the
same moment there was a slight disturbance on the eastward side of
the Square, and another little group of men came into view
surrounding a grizzled, ruddy-cheeked old fellow, whose salt-stained
blue coat spoke as eloquently of the sea as did his rolling gait.  I
could hear his hoarse, roaring voice clear across the Square--

"--ran him tops'ls down; ---- my eyes, I did; and when I get to port
what do I find, but not a King's ship within----"

My father interrupted him:

"What's this, Captain Farraday?  Do you speak of being chased?  I had
thought we were at peace with the world."

Captain Farraday discarded the listeners who had attended him so far
and stumped across the Square, bellowing his answer in tones which
brought shopkeepers to their doors and women's heads from upper
windows.

"Chased?  That I was, Master Ormerod, by as ----, scoundrelly a
pirate as flouts the King's majesty i' the ----"

Here he perceived who accompanied my father.  Off came his hat, and
he made an awkward bow.

"Your sarvent, your Excellency!  My duty, Master Colden!  But I have
no words to withdraw, for all I did not see who was near by to hear
me.  Aye, there is more to be said, much more; and matters have come
to a pretty pass when the rascals come north to these ports."

Peter Corlaer and I joined the little group of merchants who were
with the Governor, and the other curious persons hovered as close as
they dared.

"But I find this hard to give credence to, captain," said Governor
Clinton pleasantly enough.  "Pirates?  In these latitudes?  We have
not been bothered by such of late."

Captain Farraday wagged his head stubbornly.

"That's true enough, I grant your Excellency; and since the peace we
have not been bothered by French privateers, neither.  But the day'll
come we fight the French again, and then the letters of marque will
be scouring the Atlantic north and south.  And by the same token,
sir, I bid you remember the pirates are always with us, and clever
devils they are, too; for if they find their trade falling off in one
part they are away at once elsewhere.  And the first you know of them
is a score of missing ships and a mariner like myself lucky enough to
give them the slip."

"You may be right," acknowledged the Governor.  "Tell us more of your
experience.  Did you have sight of the ship which pursued you?"

"Sight?  Marry, that I did; and uncomfortable close, your Excellency.
She came up with a so'easter two days past, and at the first I made
her out for a frigate by the top-hamper she carried."

"A frigate?" protested Master Colden.  "So big as that?"

"Aye, sir, my master!  And if I have any eye for a ship's lines and
canvas she was none other than the _Royal James_ that chased me three
days together when I was home-bound from the West Indies in '43."

"That would be the vessel of the fellow known usually as Captain
Rip-Rap," spoke up my father, and there was a quality in his voice
which led me to regard him closely.

It was manifest that he labored in the grip of some strong emotion;
but the only indication of this in his face was a slight rigidity of
feature, and none of the others marked it.  I was the more amazed
because my father was a man of iron nerves, and also, though his
earlier years had been starred with a series of extraordinary
adventures, so far as I knew, he had had nothing to do with the sea.

"True for you, Master Ormerod," answered Captain Farraday; "and since
Henry Morgan died there hath not lived a more complete rogue.  One of
my mates was taken by him off Jamaica ten years gone and cites him
for a man of exquisite dress and manners that would befit a London
macaroni, God save us!  And moreover, is as arrant a Jacobite as ever
was.  Witness the name of his ship."

"I have heard he sails usually in company," remarked my father.

"He works with John Flint, who is no less of a rascal, albeit
rougher, according to those unfortunates who have fallen in his path.
Flint sails in the _Walrus_, a tall ship out of Plymouth that was on
the Smyrna run before she fell into his hands.  Betwixt them they are
a pretty pair.

"Did you ever hear, gentles, how they sank the Portuguese line-ship
off Madeira for naught but the pleasure o' destruction?  Aye, so they
did.  They ha' the metal to hammer a brace of King's ships.  But they
are wary of such.

"Portuguese, Frenchies, Spaniards or Barbary corsairs they will
assail, but they will not stop for a powder-blow with his Majesty's
people.  Why?  I know not, save 'tis never for lack o' daring.
Mayhap they know if they ever did my Lords of the Admiralty, that
take small account of the sufferings of us poor merchantmen--always
saving your Excellency's presence--would be stirred to loose a fleet
of stout frigates against 'em."

Captain Farraday stopped perforce for breath, and Governor Clinton
seized the opportunity to ask with a smile:

"Captain Rip-Rap did you call your pursuer?  What manner of name is
this?"

The merchantman shrugged his shoulders.

"Nobody knows, sir.  But 'tis the only name he goes by.  I ha' heard
that years past--oh, it may be twenty or more--he stopped a
home-bound Chesapeake packet, and when the master was haled aboard
the first question he asked was 'did he have any rip-rap in his
cargo?'  For it seems he is singularly partial to that mixture of
snuff.  And now, I ha' been told, his own men give him this name, for
even they do not know for certain that to which he was born.

"'Tis said he was a gentleman who suffered for his political
convictions, but that is as like to be a lie as the truth.  All I
know is that he chased me in past the Hook, though the _Anne_ showed
him a clean pair o' heels and had run him tops'ls down wi' sunrise
this morning.  And when I made the harbor, 'twas to find there was
not a King's ship to send after him."

"Yes," nodded the Governor; "the _Thetis_ frigate sailed for home
with dispatches a week ago.  But I will send express to Boston where
Commodore Burrage lies and bid him get to sea without loss of time.
I sympathize with your feelings, Master Farraday, and certes, 'tis
beyond toleration that such scoundrels as Rip-Rap and Flint should be
permitted to flout his Majesty's Government so openly.  Doubt not,
our good commodore will make them rue the day."

"But doubt it I must, your Excellency," returned Captain Farraday
with sturdy independence.  "An express to Boston, say you?  Humph!
That will require two days or three.  Another day to put to sea.  Two
days, or it may be three, to beat south.  Why, my masters, in a
week's time Rip-Rap and Flint will have wrought whatever fiendish
purpose they have in view and be off beyond reach."

"Mayhap, mayhap," said the Governor with a touch of impatience.  "But
'tis the best I can do."

And with Lieutenant-Governor Colden and the rest he made to move off.
Only my father lingered.

"You have letters for me, Captain Farraday?" he asked.

"Aye, indeed, sir--from Master Allen, your agent in London.  I was on
my way to deliver 'em.  And a goodly store of strouds, axes, knives,
beads, tools, flints and other trade-goods to your account."

"I will accept the letters at your hands, and even save you the trip
to Pearl Street, captain," replied my father.  "My son, Robert, here,
will visit you aboardship in the morning and take measures to arrange
for transshipping your cargo."

"I ha' no quarrel with such terms," rejoined Captain Farraday,
fishing a silken-wrapped packet from his coat-tail pocket.  "Here you
are, Master Ormerod.  And I'll be off to the George Tavern for a bite
of shore food and a mug of mulled ale."

My father fidgeted the packet in his hands for a moment.

"You are certain 'twas Captain Rip-Rap who chased you?" he asked then.

"I'd swear to his foretops'ls," answered Farraday confidently.  "Mark
you, my master, when I first sighted him I made sure he was a King's
ship, and I lay to until he was abeam.  Then I saw he showed no
colors--and moreover, there was that about him, which I'll own I can
not put a name to, made me suspicious.  So I hoisted colors.  And
still he showed none.  I fired a gun, and wi' that he bore up for me,
and I made off, wi' every sail set; aye, until the sticks groaned.
For I knew he was up to no good purpose, and I made certain that he
was Rip-Rap.

"As I said afore, he chased me once in '43, and Jenkins he took off
Jamaica in the snow _Cynthia_ out o' Southampton, when Flint was for
drowning the lot o' them; but Rip-Rap, in his cold way, says there
was no point to slaying without purpose, and they turned 'em loose in
the longboat.  And there's none left 'on the Account' that sail in a
great ship fit to be a King's frigate, save it be Rip-Rap--Flint's
_Walrus_ is a tall ship and heavy armed, but hath not the sail-spread
o' the _Royal James_.  Jenkins says _she_ was a Frenchman, and 'tis
to be admitted she hath the fine-run lines the Frenchies build."

My father was hard put to it to make head against this flow of talk,
but at last he succeeded.

"It was my understanding," he said, "that Captain Rip-Rap disappeared
from the West Indies during the late war."

Captain Farraday shrugged his shoulders.

"Like enough.  There were too many cruisers o' both sides at large in
those seas to suit him.  But now he knows we ha' back the piping
times of peace--and when nations are at peace your pirates reap their
harvest.  You may lay to that, Master Ormerod."

"'Tis not to be questioned," assented my father.  "I give you thanks,
captain.  Pray call upon me at your leisure, and if I can be of any
service to you I am at your command."

Captain Farraday stumped off toward the George, a tail of the curious
at his heels, and I grinned to myself at thought of the strong drink
they would offer him in return for his tale.  There was no chance of
his being sober inside the twenty-four hours.

My father nodded absently to Peter, who had stood throughout the
entire conversation, his flat face sleepily imperturbable.

"I like it not," he muttered, as if to himself.

Peter gave him a quick look but said nothing.

"Is there anything wrong, father?" I asked.

He frowned at me, then stared off at the housetops in a way he had,
almost as if he sought to peer beyond the future.

"No--yes--I do not know."

He broke off abruptly.

"Peter, I am glad you are here," he added.

"_Ja_," said Peter vacantly.

"You have not looked at your letters yet," I reminded him.

"I have no occasion to," he retorted.  "There is that which--But the
street is no place for such conversation.  Come home, my boy; come
home."

We set off over the snowy ground, and the people we passed bowed or
bobbed their heads to my father, for he was a great man in New York,
as great as any after the Governor; but he walked now with his eyes
upon the ground, immersed in thought.  And once again as we turned
into Pearl Street he muttered--

"Nay, I like it not."

Darby McGraw met us at the door, and from his wild gaze I knew him to
be half-expecting to behold the pirates hot-foot at our heels.

"Have you performed your tasks, Darby?" questioned my father as the
lad backed into the counting-room on the right of the entrance hall.

"Yes, master."

"Be off with you, then.  I wish not to be disturbed."

"See can you find us late news of the pirates, Darby," I added as he
slipped by.

He answered me with a merry scowl, but my father spun on his heel.

"What mean you by that, Robert?" says he.

I was nonplussed.

"Why, naught, sir.  Darby is daft on pirates.  He----"

Peter Corlaer shut the room-door upon the Irish boy and came toward
us, moving with the swift stealth that was one of his most
astonishing characteristics.

"_Ja_, he does not know," he said.

"What?" challenged my father.

"What you andt I know," returned the Dutchman calmly.

"So you know too, Peter?"

"_Ja_."

I could restrain my impatience no longer.

"What is this mystery?" I demanded.  "I thought I knew all the
secrets of the business; but sure, father, I never thought to hear
that we were concerned as a firm with pirates!"

"We are not," my father answered curtly.  "This is a matter of which
you know nothing, Robert, because until now there has been no
occasion for you to know of it."

He hesitated.

"Peter," he went on, "must we tell the boy?"

"He is not a boy; he is a man," said Peter.

I flashed my gratitude to the fat Dutchman in a smile, but he paid me
no attention.  My father, too, seemed to forget me.  He strode up and
down the counting-room, hands under the skirts of his coat, head
bowed in thought.  Tags of phrases escaped his lips:

"I had thought him dead--  Strange, if he bobs up again--  Here is a
problem I had never thought to face--  Mayhap I exaggerate--it cannot
have significance for us--  Certes, it must be accident----"

"_Neen_, he comes for a purpose," interrupted Peter.

My father stayed his walk in front of Peter by the fireplace wherein
blazed a heap of elm logs.

"Who do you fancy this Captain Rip-Rap to be, Peter?  Speak up!  You
were right when you said Robert is no longer a boy.  If there is
danger here, he deserves to know of it."

"He is Murray," replied Corlaer, his squeaking voice an incongruous
contrast with his immense bulk.

"Andrew Murray!" mused my father.  "Aye, 'twould be he.  I have
suspected it all these years--held it for certainty.  But I made sure
when he failed to show himself after the last war that Providence had
attended to him.  It seems I was wrong."

"Whoever he is, this pirate can not do harm to us in New York," I
made bold to say.

"Be not too sure, Robert," adjured my father.  "He happens to be your
great-uncle."

He reached up to the rack over the fireplace and selected a long clay
pipe, which he stuffed with tobacco the while I was recovering from
my astonishment.

"Your uncle?" I gasped then.

Corlaer hauled forward a couple of chairs, and we all sat in the
circle of the firelight, my father on one side of me and Peter on the
other.  The evening was drawing on apace, and the room was aswarm
with shadows a few feet from the hearth.  My father stared long into
the leaping heart of the flames before he answered me.

"No; your mother's," he said finally.

"But he was the great trader who conducted the contraband trade with
Canada!" I cried.  "I have heard of him.  'Twas he established the
Doom Trail to enable him to supply the French fur-traders with goods
to wean the far savages from us!  You have told me of him yourself,
as hath Master Colden.  'Twas he whom you and Corlaer and the
Iroquois fought when you broke down the barriers of the Doom Trail
and won back the fur-trade for our people.  Why, 'twas then
you--you----"

I knew the deep feeling my father still had for my long-dead mother,
and I scrupled to stir his memories.  He himself took the words from
my lips.

"Yes, 'twas then I came to love your mother.  She--she was not such
as you would expect to find allied by any ties with so great a
scoundrel.  But she was his niece--past doubt, Robert.  She was a
Kerr of Fernieside; her mother had been Murray's sister.  Kerr and
Murray were out together in the '15; Kerr fell at Sheriffmuir.  His
widow died not long afterward, and Murray took poor waif Marjory.

"He did well by her--there's no denying that.  But he always intended
to use her to further his own designs.  He had a cold eye for the
future, with no thought except of his own advantage, and if I--  But
there's no need to go into that.  You know, Robert, how Corlaer and
the Seneca chief, Tawannears--he who is now the Guardian of the
Western Door of the Long House--and I were able to smash the vast
power Murray had built up on the frontier.

"We smashed him so utterly, discrediting him too withal, that he was
obliged to flee the province; and even his friends, the French, would
have none of him--at least, aboveboard.  I have always fancied he
still served their interests at large; for he is at bottom a most
fanatical Jacobite, and eke sincere in a queer, twisted way.  Aye,
there is that about him which is difficult to understand, Robert.
Himself, he hath no hesitation in believing he serves high purposes
of state in all he does."

"But a pirate!" I exclaimed.

"Oh, that is nothing to him!"

"Not'ing," agreed Peter.  "He was a pirate on der landt."

"Only a madman could lay claim to serving the State as a pirate," I
objected.

"You speak with overconfidence," rebuked my father.  "There are men
alive today who can remember when Morgan and Davis and Dampier and
many another brave fellow of the same kidney lived by piracy and
served the King at one and the same time.  Some of 'em were hung in
the end, and Morgan died a knight.  It can be done."

"How?"

"Consider, my boy!  Murray--your great-uncle, mind you!--is a
Jacobite.  For our present Government he hath only hatred and
contempt.  Any means by which that Government was undermined would
seem to him justifiable as aiding to bring about its downfall.  Look
to the fantastic humor of the man in naming his ship the _Royal
James_!"

"If he be, indeed, the man you think he is," I returned, none too
well pleased with the thought of having a pirate for a great-uncle.
My father laughed kindly, and tapped me on the knee with his free
hand.

"I know how you feel, dear lad," he said.  "'Twas so identically your
mother talked.  Bless her heart!  We were fresh married when the
precious rascal sent us by one of his tarry-breeks that necklace
which lies now in my strong-box--the loot of some Indian queen
mayhap.  Afterward--after she had died--when you were scarce
breeched--he sent again; those silver plates upon the sideboard in
the dining-room.  Dishonestly come by, of course; but what was I to
do?  I could not cast them in the river, nor did I know how to return
them to him.  And after that again came a third messenger, this time
with no more than a letter in which he condoled with me upon the loss
of her whom we had both reverenced above all others!

"Then, I admit, I could have strangled him, for had he been
successful in his plans he would have mated her with a Frenchman who
was servant to the Foul Fiend.  Yet in his way he cared for her, and
he took much interest in all she did.  By hook or crook he had word
of us, however far he wandered.  He knew when you were born.  He knew
when she died.  And now that you have reached manhood he shows his
sails outside Sandy Hook.  I do not know what it means, Robert, but I
like it not!  I like it not!"

"But we are not at sea," I protested.  "We are in New York.  There
are soldiers in Fort George.  Commodore Burrage will be down from
Boston anon.  What can a pirate ship, what can two pirate ships,
effect against us?  Why, the city train-bands----"

"'Tis not force I dread," my father cut me off.  "'Tis the infernal
cleverness of a warped mind."

"_Ja_," agreed Peter.

My father thrust the stem of his pipe toward him.

"You feel it, too, old friend?" he cried then.

"If Murray is here he means no goodt," the Dutchman answered
ponderously.  "No pirate comes nort' in der coldt weather for just
fun.  _Neen_!  Here is too much danger; no places to run andt hide."

"Aye, you have the right of it," assented my father.  "And there have
been those who claimed New York town was not so innocent of pirates
as might appear upon the surface.  Murray and his like must sell the
goods they steal, and to that end they require connections with
traders here and elsewhere.  In Governor Burnet's time we used to
watch the Whale's Head Tavern and other like hang-outs of the more
desperate sort, but I am bound to admit we caught no bigger game than
an occasional mutineer or deserter.  Yet I know there are merchants
in the town none too particular in their dealings, and not every ship
that makes port is as peaceful as she seems by any means."

"At the least, sir, we are on the alert," I said.

My father laughed, and Corlaer's ridiculous, simpering giggle echoed
his grim mirth.

"An intelligent foe discounts so much upon launching his venture," my
father answered.  "Let us hope we have a modicum of luck to aid us.
Whatever plan Murray hath in trend 'twill come to us unexpected and
adroit in execution.  But tush.  There's the dinner-bell.  A truce to
foreboding!"




CHAPTER II

THE ONE-LEGGED MAN AND THE IRISH MAID

The next morning I was occupied for several hours in checking over
the needs of our trading-stations with Peter Corlaer, so that it was
the middle of the forenoon before I was able to leave the
counting-room to go aboard Captain Farraday's ship and concert with
her people the lightering of that portion of the cargo which was
destined for our warehouse.

Darby McGraw eyed me so wistfully when I took my hat that I sent him
to the kitchen to secure a bag of fresh-killed chickens and Winter
greens, knowing such food would be welcome to sailors after a long
voyage, and bade him carry it to the dock.  He was as pleased as if
he had been presented with his freedom, and skipped along whistling
like a skylark.

We walked down Pearl Street to Broad Street, where the landing-basin
indents the land; and I was passing on, with intent to secure a
wherry from the foot of Whitehall Street to row me out to the Bristol
packet, when Darby drew my attention to the soaring masts and tangled
cordage of a great ship lying at anchor in the East River anchorage.

"'Tis a frigate, Master Robert!" he exclaimed.

There was no mistaking the rows of painted gun-ports and the solid
bulwarks; and for a moment I fancied Commodore Burrage had
anticipated our needs.  Then the flag at her mizzen truck rippled
out, and I beheld the red-and-gold banner of Spain.

"D'ye suppose he hath come after the pirate?" whispered Darby, all
agog.

"Not he," I answered, laughing.  "'Tis a Spaniard, and he and his
kidney are not hungry for pirate gore, Darby."

"Whisht, but if he would only make to shoot off a cannon or two!"
sighed Darby.  "Or maybe hang a poor soul at the yardarm the while we
watched.  Oh, Master Robert, wouldn't it be grand?"

"Go to," said I, laughing again at the quaint fancies of the lad.
"You are as bloodthirsty as any pirate that sails the Spanish Main."

"I'll warrant you I am," returned Darby sturdily.  "I'd be a grand
pirate, I would--and I'd make naught of frigates, be they Spaniard or
King's ship; aye, or Frenchies.  I'd take 'em all!"

"Certes, you would," I agreed.  "But look, Darby!  There's another
strange vessel--beyond the frigate."

I pointed to a battered little brig with patched and dirty sails and
a spatter of white showing in her black-painted hull where a
roundshot had sent the splinters flying.

"And he hath seen the pirates, or I am amiss," I added.  "His escape
must have been exceeding narrow."

Darby's eyes waxed as large as a cat's in the dark.

"Whurra, whurra, do but look to the shot-hole in the side of him!
'Tis he will have made a noble prayer.  And now will ye mock me for
saying there are pirates abroad, Master Robert?"

"Not I, Darby.  Yon fellow has been closer to death than I like to
think of," I answered.

"Now there was as true a word as ever was heard spoke," proclaimed a
pleasant voice behind me.  "And shows most unaccountable
understanding and humanitee, so it do, seeing as there's precious few
landsmen as stop to figger out the chances a poor sailor must take
and never a thankee from his owners nor aught but curses from his
skipper, like as not.  True as true, young gentleman.  I makes you my
duty, and says as how, seeing I was one of them vouchsafed a
miraculous salvation, I hopes you'll permit me to offer my most
humble thanks."

I swung around to scrutinize the owner of the voice and saw a
handsome, open-faced man in the prime of life, big and strong of his
body, but with only one leg.  The other, the left, had been lopped
off high up near the hip, and he supported himself upon a long crutch
of very fine-carved hardwood--mahogany, I afterward discovered.  This
crutch he employed with all the dexterity of his missing limb.  A
thong from a hole under the armpiece was looped around his neck, so
that when he chose to sit down his support could never fall out of
his reach; and in its butt was set a sharp spur of steel to give it a
grip upon rough ground or slippery decks.

While I looked at him and he was first speaking he hopped up beside
me with a confidential air that was very flattering to a young man
and impressed Darby even more than it did me.

"Are you from the brig yonder?" I asked curiously.

"Aye, aye, young gentleman, I am; and one of the miserable sinners as
was saved by an inscrootable Providence as takes no account o' men's
deserts, just or unjust, as the preachers' sayin' is.  Out of
Barbaders, I am, in the brig _Constant_.  Name o' Silver, sir--John,
says my sponsors in baptism.

"But my mates most generally calls me 'Barbecue' 'count o' my being
held a monstrous fine cook.  And there's a tale to that, young sir.
Ah, yes!  This weren't the first time I suffered at the hands o' them
pirates that scourge and ravage the seas to the despite of poor,
honest sailormen."

He lowered his voice.

"D'ye see this lopsided carcass of mine now?  You do, says you.  Yes,
yes; there ain't no mistakin' a one-legged man.  And how do you
suppose I lost my left stick, eh?  Can't say, says you--nor it ain't
strange, seein' as we've never met afore this.

"Well, I'll tell ye, sir.  You ha' a young face, and kind, and I can
see you take an interest in an unfortunate sailor-man's sorrows--aye,
and this good lad wi' ye, too--from Ireland, ain't ye, my hearty?  I
knowed it, I knowed it!

"But what was I a-sayin'?  Oh, yes, to be sure.  I was tellin' ye of
my lost leg--and glad I am it wasn't my flipper as went.  'Cause why,
says you?  'Cause a man can set himself to makin' good a lost leg,
which ain't no use for nothin' except walking.

"But a hand now?  Figger it out, my master!  No hand, and ye can't
work, ye can't fight, ye can't scarcely eat.  That's why I says I'm
lucky."

The man attracted me by his originality, and I own frankly I would
have pressed him for further information whether Darby had been with
me or not; but 'twas Darby brought him back to the main point of
interest.

"Did ye see the pirates?" panted the lad in excitement.

John Silver drew himself erect upon his crutch and frowned out at the
shot-scarred brig.

"See 'em?" he repeated.  "Well now, my lad, that depends.  Aye, aye,
it all depends.

"This last time, d'ye mean?  No, I can't conscientiously say I seen
'em this time.  In the matter o' my leg 'twas different--and the time
Flint marooned me."

"You know Flint then?" I broke in upon him.

He shook his head.

"Know him?  Oh, no, young gentleman; I don't know no bloody villains
like that.  I ha' seen 'em, yes--a sight too many of 'em, as ye might
say.  And suffered most terrible at their hands; but I make no doubt
the Lord is decided I ha' suffered my portion, seein' that this last
time He delivered me safe and sound out o' the scoundrels' hands."

"Was it off Sandy Hook they attacked you?" I inquired.

"Off Sandy Hook?" he repeated.  "Maybe 'twas so, young gentleman.  We
took small reckoning o' where we were.  Our one thought was to make
port whole and safe."

"But I see they hulled you?" I pressed him.

"That?" he answered.  "Oh, yes; but--  May I make bold to ask, sir,
ha' other vessels been chased off New York port, do you know?"

I pointed to where Captain Farraday's craft swung at her anchor a
scant quarter-mile above the brig.

"That Bristol packet ran the notorious Captain Rip-Rap tops'ls down
but yester-morning," I told him.

His brows knit together in a frown, apparently of thought.

"Captain Rip-Rap you says it was!  Blister me, young gentleman, but
that's dreadful news.  Well, well, well!  A fortunate escape as ever
was.  And 'tis good hearing that others was ekal lucky.  But I dare
say the King's ships will be after him by now?"

"No, there's none nearer than Boston," I answered.  "'Twill be a week
at the least before we can hunt the scoundrels hence."

He wagged his head dolefully.

"Blister me, but that's ill news.  Fortunate, indeed, I was to draw
clear.  He was after me till darkness and sheered off more in fear o'
the sands than for aught else, I dare swear."

"So it was yesterday he chased you?" I asked.

"To be sure, young sir.  Wasn't that what I told ye?  Yesterday,
about the noon glass, he came a-thunderin' up, and towards dusk he
could bring his bow-chasers to bear, and was for droppin' a spar to
hinder us.  But we took his shot in the hull, as ye see, and got off
safe in spite of all he could do."

One of the wherrymen was sculling toward us along the shore, and I
waved to him to pull under the piling on which we stood.

"I must be off," I said.  "I congratulate you, Master Silver, on your
escape.  Whatever dangers you may have encountered in the past, your
good luck was with you yesterday."

He bobbed his head and pulled at his forelock.

"Thank'ee kindly, young gentleman.  Here, sir, let me catch the
painter.  Right!  Will ye ha' the basket on the thwart by ye?  And
this nice lad here, doesn't he go, too?  No?

"Maybe then ye'd add a mite to your kindness and let me borry his
time for a half-glass or so for to show me a couple o' landmarks I
must make in the town.  I wouldn't ask it of ye, sir, only as ye see,
I'm half-crippled in a manner o' speakin', and this is a strange port
to me, as plies usual to the West Injies."

"Use the lad by all means," I answered.  "Darby, take Master Silver
wherever he wishes to go."

Darby's freckled face gleamed at the prospect of more of the company
of this one-legged sailorman, who talked so easily of pirate fights
and flights.

"Oh, aye, Master Robert," says he.  "I'll help him all I know."

"O' course he will," spoke up Silver.  "I never seed a boy wi' a
kinder face.  A kind face means a kind heart, I always says, young
gentleman."

My wherryman was on the point of laying to his oars when a sudden
thought caused me to check him.

"By the way, Master Silver," I called, "it occurs to me that perhaps
Darby may be unable to serve you in all that you wish.  Do you seek
any one in especial?"

He hesitated for just the fraction of a minute.

"Why, not especially in particklar, sir," he answered at last.  "I am
for the Whale's Head Tavern, if ye happen to know o' such a place."

I nodded.

"'Tis in the East Ward close by.  Darby can show you."

He shouted renewed thanks and stumped off agilely on his crutch,
Darby strutting beside him with a comical pride.

Aboard the _Anne_ I found all in confusion.  Captain Farraday, as I
had expected, had not returned since he landed the preceding
afternoon and undoubtedly was sleeping off an accumulation of divers
liquors in the George Tavern.  The mate had gone ashore that morning
to search for him, and would probably take advantage of the
opportunity to emulate his skipper's example.  Master Jenkins, who
had missed drowning at the red hands of the redoubtable Rip-Rap and
Flint, was in charge of the ship.  He was a melancholy, sour-visaged
East-countryman, who moved with a deliberation as pronounced as Peter
Corlaer's, and inspecting the manifests with him was a tedious
business.  I accepted an invitation to share his midday meal, and the
afternoon was gone when we concluded our work, agreed upon the time
of arrival of the lighters on the morrow and returned to the deck.

My wherry had been dismissed long ago, and he bade the bosun muster a
crew to row me ashore.  Standing by the gangway, I commented idly
upon the two ships which had come in since morning.

"The brig had a close go of it with your friend Rip-Rap," I remarked.

"Aye," returned Jenkins glumly.  "'Tis passing queer a Barbadan
should be fetching sugar and rum to New York.  They leave that mostly
to the Yankees."

"True," I admitted; "yet there's an exception to every rule."

A silvery whistle-blast sounded on the deck of the Spanish frigate
up-stream.

"Too bad that's not one of ours now," I commented.  "Rip-Rap should
have a dose of his own medicine."

Master Jenkins expressed utter disapprobation without a wrinkle on
his features.

"They Spaniards!" he snorted.  "What are they a-doin' here anyway,
I'd like to know?"

"He may have been blown north on his crossing," I hazarded.

Master Jenkins snorted a second time.

"He hasn't started a rope.  Mischief they're up to.  Never knowed it
to fail."

"What kind of mischief?" I inquired.

He shrugged his shoulders.

"Not knowin', can't say.  But no good ever came from they Spaniards,
Master Ormerod, and ye may lay to that."

Before I could answer him the bosun reported the small boat all clear
and lying at the ladder-foot, and I bade Master Jenkins a hasty good
evening, for his stolid pessimism became mighty irksome upon close
acquaintance.

As my boat straightened away from the Bristol packet's side a barge
shot around the hull of the Spaniard and pulled after us, a dozen
brawny fellows tugging at the oars.  A single cloaked figure sat in
the stern sheets beside the officer in command.  The two boats made
the Broad Street slip almost together, and I leaped ashore, tossed
several coins to the sailors who had rowed me and started to walk
off, bent upon reporting to my father, who, I knew, would be provoked
by the length of time my errand had consumed.  But I had not walked
far when a man called after me from the wharf-head.

"_Señor_!  Sirr-rr-rah!"

I turned to face the coxswain of the frigate's barge and a farrago of
Spanish gibberish of which I understood not a word.  And upon my
saying as much, a second person stepped forward into the yellow glow
of an oil lanthorn which hung from a bracket upon a warehouse wall
hard by.  'Twas the cloaked figure of the barge, and instead of a
midshipman or under-officer the scanty light revealed a young woman
whose lissome grace was vibrant through the cumbersome folds of her
wrap.  A single ejaculation of sibilant Spanish, and the coxswain was
hushed.

"Sir," said she then in English as good as my own, "can you direct me
to the Whale's Head Tavern?"

I could bring forth no better than a stammer in answer.  She was the
second stranger that day to ask for the Whale's Head, which my father
had remarked the previous evening for a noted resort of bad
characters; and certes, she appeared to be the last sort of woman who
might be expected to have anything to do with the kind of roistering
wickedness which went on there.  Also, I could not forbear asking
myself how came so fair a maid aboard a Spanish frigate.

In the soft lanthorn-light she was anything but Spanish in her looks.
Dark, yes, with hair that shone a misty-black, but her eyes were as
blue as Darby McGraw's, and her nose had the least suspicion of a
tilt to it.  Her mouth was wide, with a kind of twist at the ends
that quirked up oddly when she laughed and drooped with a sorrow fit
to crack open your heart if she wept.  And she was little more than a
child in years, with a manifest innocence which went oddly with the
question she had asked me.

A slim foot tapped impatiently upon the cobbles as I stared.

"Well, sir," she said coldly, "does it happen you do not know English
better than Spanish?"

"N-no," I managed to get out.  "But--but the truth is, the Whale's
Head is no place for such as you, mistress."

Her eyes narrowed.

"I do not catch your meaning, perhaps," she answered.  "It is my
father I go to meet there."

"But he would never favor your coming there at this hour," I
protested.

She permitted herself a trill of laughter.

"You speak as if you had full knowledge of his ways," she admitted.
"But the nuns at St. Bridget's were telling me oft and oft how I was
going out into the wicked world, and sorra a look at wickedness have
I had yet.  So I decided this evening I should have some savor of
adventure to make up for being cooped all these weeks in that horrid,
dirty old ship; and I made Don Pablo, who was officer of the deck,
call away a boat for me--and he wringing his hands and pleading would
I bring about his ruin."

I laughed, myself, at the wonderful spontaneity of her mood.  Faith,
I could imagine how the young dons aboard the frigate philandered
themselves sick over her.

"But that has naught to do with your going to the Whale's Head
tonight," I reminded her.  "Indeed, you should never think of it."

"I will be the judge of that," she retorted, instantly haughty.  "And
if my father is there I can come to no harm."

"If he is," I said.  "I doubt you have mistaken his ordinary."

"No, no," she said decidedly.  "I heard him speaking with them of it.
But it may be you are right, sir, and I will not be so ungrateful as
to flout a kindly stranger's well-meant advice.  Juan can go into the
tavern when we come to it, and I will bide outside.  But somewhere I
must walk, for my feet are all dancey with the sway of the sea, and
we shall be away again with the tide in the morning.  This is the
last dry land I shall tread in many a week."

"If you will allow me, I'll put you on your way for the Whale's
Head," I offered.  "I must walk in that direction."

"Sure, sir, it is a great favor you offer," she answered.  "I can not
but thank you."

And she gave an order in Spanish which fetched the under-officer she
called Juan and one of his men out from the shadows.  They fell in
behind us as we walked off along the line of the warehouses.

"You are upon a long voyage?" I ventured.

"You may well say so," she cried.  "From here to the Floridas, and
after that on to the Havana and the cities of the Main."

"You will soon have no need to regret a lack of adventures," I said.
"There are few men, let alone maids, who fare so far afield."

"Ah, sir, that is what I like to think upon!  I was near mad with
delight when my father came to the convent and took me from the
sisters.  Until the ship's decks were under my feet I could not
believe it was true that I was really free."

"But you are never Spanish!" I said.  "I ask not in idle curiosity,
though----"

Her laughter was like a chime of bells.

"Sure, they say I am as Irish as the pigs in the Wicklow hills where
I was born."

And all of a sudden she was grave again.

"I am not knowing your politics, sir, but there's maybe no harm in
just telling you my father was of those who opposed the Hanoverian
and fought for King James and Bonnie Charlie.  And because his own
King can not employ him, he serves Spain."

"It is not pleasant for an Englishman to think of all the brave
gentlemen must serve foreign monarchs," I acknowledged.  "But I hope
you will be happy in the Indies, mistress."

"Oh, we shall not be staying there long," she answered blithely.  "My
father is an engineer officer, and he must inspect the fortifications
on the Main and elsewhere.  We shall be returning to Spain within the
year.  But look, sir!  Is not that sign intended to be a whale's
head?"

"Yes," I said.  "This is the tavern."

One look at its flaring windows and the cut-throat gentry who
swaggered in and out of the low door convinced my companion that I
had not misrepresented the character of the place.  She drew back to
the curb, and the corners of her mouth drooped sadly.

"Glory, what an ill hole!" she murmured.  "Now for why would the
_padre_ come hither?  Business, says he; but----"

And she shook her head with a vague doubting emphasis.

"I would not seem to be thrusting myself upon you, mistress," I said,
"yet I am fearful your Spaniards can not make themselves understood.
Will it please you that I inquire within for your father?"

She considered, catching a corner of her lip betwixt white teeth.

"Troth, sir," she answered finally, "I see not how I can avoid going
the deeper in debt to you."

There was a moment's pause.

"And how shall I----"

"Ay de mi!" she exclaimed with a bubble of laughter.  "How stupid of
me to be forgetting I am just a maid off the sea to you.  Ask for
Colonel O'Donnell, sir, and tell him his daughter waits without."

And as I started toward the door she added gayly:

"It is not every girl could step upon a strange shore and find a
cavalier waiting to aid her.  But what would Mother Seraphina say to
such brazenness?  Ah, I can see her now!  The blessed saints preserve
us, Moira!  Have ye no manners or modesty into yourself at all?  A
hundred Aves and the Stations of the Cross twice before you sup."

Her voice was still ringing in my ears as I shouldered a drunken
sailor from my path, lowered my head to pass under the lintel of the
tavern's entrance and so gained the hazy blue atmosphere of the
taproom, cluttered with tables, foul with smoke and stale alelees,
abuzz with rough voices bawling oaths and sea-songs.

It was the chorus of one of these songs which first distracted my
thoughts from the Irish girl outside--a wild, roaring lilt of blood
and ribaldry:

  "Fifteen men on the Dead Man's Chest--
    Yo-ho-ho, and a bottle of rum!
  Drink and the devil had done for the rest--
    Yo-ho-ho, and a bottle of rum!"


I looked to the corner whence it came, and discovered the one-legged
sailor, John Silver, thumping the time with a pewter mug on the
table-top as he led the group around him, foremost amongst whom,
after himself, was Darby McGraw, flaming red mop standing out like a
buccaneer ensign, shrill voice carrying above the thundering basses
of his companions--as villainous a crew, to outward seeming, as I had
ever looked upon.  I noted especially a pasty, tallowy-faced man,
whose shifty eyes were masked by a skrim of greasy black hair, and a
big, lusty, mahogany-brown fellow with a tarry pigtail, who evidently
found as much satisfaction in the song as poor, fuddled Darby.

Silver saw me almost as soon as I spotted him, and with a quick word
to the others, got to his feet and stumped across the room, dragging
Darby after him by the arm.  His large, good-humored features were
wreathed in a smile tinged with mortification.

"So you come after him, Master Ormerod, did you?" he shouted to make
himself heard in the confusion.  "And ashamed o' myself I oughter be,
says you, and with reason, too.  But I'm not one to lead a likely lad
astray, and all Darby's had was good, ripe ale and two earsful o'
sea-gossip as'll give him things to dream o' for nights to come.  I
shouldn't oughter o' let him come back, sir, but when he stuck that
red mop o' his in the door an hour past I hadn't the heart to send
him away.  He's come to no harm, so you won't hold it against him for
a extry mug or two of ale; will you, sir?"

"I did not come after him," I answered; "but as I am here he had best
return home with me.  Where did you get my name, Silver?"

He pulled his forelock knowingly.

"Why, from Darby, o' course, sir--not that anybody on the water-front
couldn't ha' told me, seein' what a kind-hearted, friendly young
gentleman you are.  But asking your pardon for the liberty, sir, can
I serve you in any way?"

"I don't think so," I told him.  "I am seeking a Colonel O'Donnell."

I fancied a flicker of surprise stirred the bluff friendliness
mirrored in his face.  He stared around the room.

"Never heard o' the gentleman, sir, which ain't surprizin', seein' I
was never here before this morning, myself; but I ran into some old
shipmates of mine as gave me the run o' the place, and it may be I
can find out for you from one o' them.  Just you wait here a shake,
Master Ormerod, and I'll see what I can do."

This seemed the wisest course, inasmuch as it was apparent there was
nobody in the taproom of the quality of Colonel O'Donnell, so I
nodded assent; and as Silver stumped away, threading a nimble passage
in and out of the crowded tables, I asked Darby what he had been
doing.  Somewhat to my astonishment, the boy lapsed into sullenness
and answered in monosyllables.  Only once he revealed a flare of
interest, when I remarked:

"That was a sufficiently devilish song you were singing, Darby."

"That it was!" he exclaimed.  "Whisht, whiles singing it ye can
_feel_ the blood a-dripping from your cutlass."

"And who were the others singing with you?"

The sullen look covered his face like a curtain.

"Oh, just shipmates."

"Of yours?"

"No, of Master Silver's."

"What are their names?"

"I know not."

"Oh, come now, Darby!"

"Well, the one he calls Bill Bones and the other Black Dog--but
there's no meaning in nature in that last."

Silver had disappeared through a door at the rear in company with one
of the drawers, and now he came swinging in again on his crutch,
ahead of a tall, lantern-jawed man in a rich dress of
black-and-silver, whose gold-hilted sword claimed the gentleman.
This man Silver ushered to me with a crudely hearty courtesy.

"Here's luck, Master Ormerod," he called when he was within earshot.
"My friend had heard tell the colonel was above-stairs.  This here's
the young gentleman I spoke of, your honor.  My duty to ye both,
sirs, and always pleased to serve."

And off he swung on his crutch again to be received with acclamations
by his cronies in the corner.

The lantern-jawed man gave me a keen glance, almost a suspicious
glance, I should have said.  He had a nervous manner, and there was a
kind of restless glow in his eyes.

"Well, sir?" he said.  "I understand you desired speech with me?"

"If you are Colonel O'Donnell----"

He nodded curtly.

"--I am to tell you that your daughter awaits you outside," I
concluded.

He was genuinely startled.

"My daughter?  But who are you, sir, who act as her guardian?"

I was nettled, and did not hesitate to show it.

"She asked me the way hither when she came ashore," I retorted, "and,
deeming it scarce probable that you would care to have her enter the
taproom, I even offered my services to fetch you forth to her."

I saw now his resemblance to her, for the corners of his mouth
twitched down in the same way her's had.  And he muttered something
like a curse in Spanish.

"It seems I am beholden to you, sir," he answered stiffly.  "She is a
child, and vastly ignorant of the world, and I must be both father
and mother to her."

I bowed and stood aside to make room for him to pass out.

"Master Ormerod, the seaman called you, did he not?" continued
O'Donnell.  "Perhaps, sir, you will permit an older man to compliment
you upon an honorable deportment."

A slightly pompous tone invaded his speech.

"I am not unfamiliar with the chief centers of our Old World society,
Master Ormerod, and I have the honor to hold the office of
chamberlain to a monarch, who, though he may not be named upon
English soil, will some day recover the estate a usurper has deprived
him of.  I need say no more, I am sure."

"I understand, sir," I replied.  "And may I suggest that Mistress
O'Donnell is awaiting you?"

He brushed by me with a click of impatience, and Darby and I followed
him to the street, Darby thrilled anew by the sight of his luxurious
habit, the five-pound ruffles that covered his wrists and the worked
hilt of his sword.  As we all three emerged, Mistress O'Donnell
darted up to her father and caught at the lapels of his coat.

"Ah, _padre_," she cried in a brogue that clotted and slurred her
words, "you'll not be holding it against me because I wearied of the
ship and would feel the earth crumbling underfoot, and me so lonely
for lack of you I was near to weeping the while I sat in my cabin
with naught to do but read my Hours!"

He wilted, as must any man have done, flinging his arm around her
with a gesture that verged on the theatrical.

"Tush, tush, Moira," he rebuked her gently; "'twas unbecoming in you,
and in Spanish lands such conduct would lead to trouble.  See that
you do it not a second time.  I will give you in charge of Juan; and,
having had your taste of freedom, you must return aboard, for I have
matters yet requiring my attention.  Ah, yes, and you must thank this
gentleman properly for his gallantry.  Master Ormerod, my dear!  His
father is a great merchant of this town."

Mistress O'Donnell swept me a willowy curtsey, and as I bowed
acknowledgment I wondered where he had secured such exact information
about me.  He had seemed totally ignorant of who I was when we met.

"Sure, I'll not be after trying to thank you," says my lady to me
with a twinkle in her eye.  "For I couldn't find the words would
express my gratitude.  But for you, 'tis an awful fool I'd have made
of myself this quarter-hour past."

Colonel O'Donnell hemmed reprovingly.

"Let it be a lesson to you, my girl.  My thanks to you again, Master
Ormerod.  My compliments to your father, if it please you.  Good
night, sir."

I understood that he wished to be rid of me, and accepted the cue.

"Good night, sir," I replied.  "And a fair voyage to you, mistress.
If I can be of further service, pray command me."

"No, Master Ormerod, here our paths diverge," she answered softly,
and placed her hand upon her father's arm.

A moment later I was hurrying north and west, Darby McGraw chattering
beside me, for the lady's bright beauty seemed to have scoured the
sulkiness from his spirits.

"Ah, there was the lovely, gracious maid for ye, Master Robert!" he
cried.  "Did ye hark to the song in her voice?  And did ye see the
blue in her eyes, like lake-water with green fields all around and
the sun shining faint?  She's the breath of the Ould Sod; and oh,
whirra, it's never more I'll see it, for they say I'm to be a pirate."

"You talk nonsense," I returned harshly.

"Nonsense?" he repeated.  "It's a grand word, nonsense, Master
Robert.  But whisht, now, ye'll say a good word for me with the old
master, won't ye?"

I told him I would, mostly to stop the clacking of his tongue; and he
skipped high like a colt that has just had its first meal of oats.

"She put the comether on ye, that elegant young maid," he continued.
"She had a way with her, she did.  Aye, for her I'd give over being a
pirate."

"We'll never see her again, Darby," I said.  "She'll be beyond the
Caribbees a few weeks hence, and we plodding at our tasks here in New
York."

He gave me a shrewd glance.

"Indeed, and it's a wiser man than the Pope can see beyond the weeks,
Master Robert," says he.




CHAPTER III

A CALLER IN THE NIGHT

We sat late at dinner that night, for my father must needs have me
repeat at length the tale of my experiences during the day, revealing
a perturbation unusual in him, although Peter Corlaer ate on with
placid solemnity, scarce a flicker of interest in his little eyes
that were almost buried behind their ramparts of flesh.

"I have heard of this Colonel O'Donnell," said my father when I had
made an end.  "He was in Scotland with Prince Charles--one of the
Irish crew who bogged a promising venture, if what men say be true.
I marvel at his temerity in landing here, for there must be a price
upon his head in England.  Doubtless he was consorting with some of
our Jacobite sympathizers at the Whale's Head--a fitting place for
such an intrigue!

"The captain of the frigate called upon the Governor this morning, so
Master Colden told me, with a cock-and-bull story of a mistake in his
reckoning that took him north of his course.  I smell the taint of a
Jacobite plot!  Your gloomy friend Jenkins had the right of it.
Never trust a Spaniard when he comes with pretense of friendship."

"Mistress O'Donnell said they were for the Floridas," I protested.
"Sure, they are not far out of their course."

My father smiled for the first time.

"The little maid would have no knowledge of her father's purpose.
And if she did--  No, no, lad, I had my share of plotting in my
youth.  Our Jacobites are a pernicious lot."

"Yet you, yourself, were one of them," I pointed out, a thought
maliciously.

His face darkened.

"True, and I learned by experience.  Set that to my credit, Bob.
Britain is greater than any king or any family.  'Tis the country,
not the man, must be considered.  And Britain fares better under
Hanoverian George than she ever did under a Stuart Charles or James."

I was still unconvinced.

"But certes, sir, 'tis in no sense strange for the Spaniards to
dispatch an engineer to inspect their fortifications this side the
Atlantic."

"An Irish engineer officer?"

My father smiled again.

"'Tis to be wondered at.  But there!  In such a devious business we
might not hope to reach the truth, nor am I greatly concerned
thereat.  Most Jacobite plots are ill-planned sallies by desperate,
misguided men.  No, boy, what irks me most is the tidings you had of
the one-legged sailor.  Silver, you called him?  Yes, I like it not
to hear the pirates are outside our harbor.  It hath the look of
daring beyond the ordinary.  If Murray----"

The door behind me opened, and I saw my father's jaw drop.  Peter, at
my right hand, let his eyelids blink, then went on quietly cracking
nuts between his huge fingers.

"Did I hear you call me, Ormerod?"

The voice from the doorway had a chill, level quality that was as
resonant as the tolling of a bell.

"'If Murray'--  I _thought_ I heard my name?"

I screwed around in my chair.  There in the doorway stood the most
remarkable figure I had ever seen.  A large man, straight as an arrow
despite the years that had planted crow's feet so thickly about his
eyes, his square shoulders showed to advantage the exquisite
tailoring of the black velvet coat he wore.  His small-clothes were
of a fine yellow damasked silk, and his stockings of silk to match.
Diamonds flashed from the buckles of his shoes, his fob, his fingers
and the hilt of his dress-sword.  A great ruby glowed in the Mechlin
jabot that cascaded from his throat.  Over his arm hung a cloak, and
under his elbow was tucked a hat cocked in the latest mode.

But it was the memory of his face that abided with you.  The features
were all big and strongly carved; the nose was a jutting beak above a
tight-lipped mouth and a jaw that was brutally square; the eyes were
a vivid black, flecked with tawny lights.  His hair was of a pure,
silvery whiteness and drawn back, clubbed and tied with a black
ribbon.  His cheeks and brows were furrowed by a maze of wrinkles,
yet the flesh seemed as firm as mine.  In every way he suggested
breeding, gentility, wealth; but there was a combined effect of
sinister power and predatory will, a hint of ruthless egotism which
took no account of any interests save his own.

He acknowledged my prolonged stare with a slight bow, mildly derisive.

"Your son, Ormerod?" he continued.  "My grandnephew?  Robert, I
think, you named him, for the redoubtable Master Juggins of London,
who aided you to start life anew after you had contrived to wreck
yourself upon the rocks of a foresworn Jacobite career."

My father rose slowly to his feet.

"Yes, he is my son, Murray.  It is neither his fault nor mine that he
is also your grandnephew.  As to his name, Robert Juggins was a
better man than you or I, and you can not inspire my son against me
by hinting at hidden chapters of my early life.  He knows that I was
deluded into serving the Stuarts, and lived to learn that country
comes before king.  We were talking of that before you entered."

The man in the doorway nodded his head.

"I seem to remember that became a topic of some interest to
you--after the Jacobites hounded you from France and the Hanoverians
drove you from England.  Ah, well, I can commend a philosophical
adaptability in face of adversity.  'Tis a trait I have had occasion
to practise, myself."

He let the door swing to, and stepped behind me to the left side of
the table, where there was a vacant chair.

"I would not seem discourteous," he remarked suavely.  "I note
another old friend, Ormerod--or perhaps I should say an old enemy.
Permit me to observe, Corlaer, that you wear well with the years--as
well as myself, indeed."

Peter squeezed a hickory-nut between his forefinger and thumb and
looked up vacantly into Murray's face.

"_Ja_," he said.

"Lest you should be tempted by some misapprehension," pursued Murray,
"I may inform you that I have every reason to suppose myself safe
from any measures you might take against me.  I know well the
dangerous swiftness of wit Peter conceals beneath that flat face of
his, and I should not like to see him hurt----"

"_Ja_, you bet," giggled the Dutchman.

"I assure you such is the fact," answered Murray.  "I hope to do what
I have come here for tonight without injuring anybody, and if you
gentlemen will listen to me quietly for a few moments I am confident
that the issue will be harmless for all of us."

He cast his cloak and hat upon a chair by the fire, and put his hand
upon the vacant one betwixt my father and me.

"May I?" he asked.

My father, still standing, said nothing; and Murray, with a shrug,
accepted the silence for consent, sank gracefully into the seat and
drew a golden snuff-box, studded with brilliants, from a pocket.

"With your permission," he said, springing the cover.

A fragrant whiff of snuff-tobacco tickled my senses as he offered it
generally.

"'Tis excellent stuff," he remarked.  "Ripe Rip-Rap.  What?  None of
you?  Ah, then----"

He dusted a pinch under his nostrils, inhaled and daintily used his
handkerchief, a lace-edged morsel such as women carry.

My father leaned forward across the table, a blaze of hatred in his
face.

"'Tis true, then!"

Murray regarded him in some surprize.

"True?  My dear sir, I assured you 'twas Rip-Rap."

My father turned to Peter and me.

"After I told you--about this man, Robert--I hoped that I was
wrong--that I had done him an injustice.  But now he has convicted
himself out of his own lips."

Murray gently deposited the snuffbox upon the table in front of him.

"Ah," he murmured.  "I see!  You were referring to my nickname, or,
shall we say, _nomme de guerre_?"

My father laughed bitterly.

"_Nomme de guerre_!  Name of a pirate!  But let us have it, fair and
openly, Andrew Murray.  Are you Captain Rip-Rap?"

"I suppose most people would agree with your description," replied
Murray; "although personally I prefer the word buccaneer.  It is
susceptible to so much wider use, and there is about it a suggestion
of----  However, we are not interested here tonight in the more
abstruse branches of etymology.  I am the person popularly known on
the high seas as Captain Rip-Rap, and I fancy I might have logical
grounds for arguing that if any disgrace adheres to me by that
admission, 'twas you, Ormerod, who drove me to the practise of what
you call piracy."

"'Tis like you to take that tone," said my father.  "I drove you from
the practise of what amounted to piracy on the land.  There is no
difference in the way you earn your livelihood today, Murray.  You
were an outlaw, and you are an outlaw."

"I fear you are incapable of doing me justice," sighed Murray.  "You
should know that I have always labored to serve higher ends than the
mere sordid pursuit of money, such as has possessed you and those
like you."

He wagged his head sadly.

"I had hoped better of you, Ormerod.  You are of good blood, man.
'Sdeath, do you never think on what you lose by playing the small
colonial merchant here?"

"I think better of the estate I won unaided, with my bare hands and
wits, than of the manor I lost in England through youthful folly,"
rejoined my father.  "But I never thought to hear a pirate prate of
the blessings of birth.  Phaugh!"

Murray's face purpled, and a Scots burr crept into his speech.

"No man challenges my birth," he shouted.  "I am of better blood than
you.  I trace my lineage to James V.  I quarter my arms with the
Douglases, the Homes, the Morays, the Keiths, the Hepburns, aye, and
with the oldest clans beyond the Highland Line!"

"I have heard so before," commented my father drily.

Murray breathed deeply, obviously fighting for self-control.

"Let it pass!" he exclaimed with a magnificent gesture.  "What doth
it signify?  I am what I am, sir--and the day comes when I shall
stand as high as the highest."

He drew himself up very erect in his chair, but my father answered
with the same dry scorn:

"That too I have heard before.  Once, I mind, you expected to be a
duke by exploiting ill-gotten gains with Jacobite intrigue.  Aye, you
would have ruined your country, sold her to the French like enough,
all for a peerage.  Now, I suppose, you would do it again."

"What would you?"

Murray flicked a pinch of snuff into his nostrils.

"The luck was against me, although you, yourself, and silent Peter
there, know how close to success I came."

"_Ja_," squeaked Peter, still busy crushing nuts and slowly crunching
their meats.

"I have had the Devil's own luck," Murray went on, heedless of the
Dutchman.  "In the '45 I was half the world away, for there were too
many cruisers abroad in the Caribbees for my comfort.  Before I could
get back the Prince had played and lost.  A shame!  With me----"

"With you he would have been sold to Government for the thirty
thousand pounds reward that Cumberland offered." said my father.

Murray looked hurt.

"I have been accused of much," he replied; "but never of disloyalty
to King James or his sons."

"True," assented my father; "you could never earn anything by it.
Your opportunities all came from the other direction."

"Your words are unjust, sir," said Murray with a hauteur he had not
shown previously.  "Indeed, if matters fall out, as I anticipate, I
shall soon give proof which can not be ignored of my devotion to the
Good Cause.  I am preparing a combination which----"

He swung around suddenly upon me.

"But I am forgetting my main purpose!" he cried.  "Stand up,
grandnephew, and let me have a look at you."

I would not have heeded him, but my father said quickly:

"Do as he asks you, Robert.  I'd not have him think you are crooked
in the legs."

So I stood.

"A likely build," he remarked warmly.  "You favor your father, I
see--save in the face, it may be.  There you are your mother, my maid
Marjory.  Ah, sweet chit, would she were with us now!  A sad loss; a
sad loss, lad!"

The expression which came to my father's face was terrible in its
intensity of passion.  He leaned closer to Murray, white to the
cheekbones, his nostrils pinched in.

"Murray," he said, "make an end of such talk!  As you value your
life, mention her not again.  I know not what cards you hold up your
sleeve here, but if we all die in the next moment I will slay you as
you sit if you profane her memory with your foul tongue."

Murray stared up at him coolly and took a pinch of snuff.

"Ah, well, you were always prejudiced," he answered.  "I--  But it
serves no purpose to reopen old wounds.  I am of one mind with you
there.  Yet tell me this: Have you poisoned the boy's mind against
me?"

My father dropped back into his seat with a sour grimace.

"Poisoned his mind?" he repeated.  "I told him no more recently than
yesterday who and what you were.  You brought that upon yourself by
pursuing your rascally trade in these seas.  Until then the boy did
not so much as know that you existed--as his relative."

My great-uncle--I was gradually beginning to think of him as
such--pondered this news, head on one side, peering from my father to
me and back again.

"I see, I see," he murmured.  "Humph!  I fear his mind hath been
corrupted.  But I am not surprized.  No, no!  I prepared for this."

"For what?" demanded my father.

Murray leaned abruptly across the table.

"I will be frank with you, Ormerod--and with Nephew Robert here.  I
am somewhat in difficulties----"

"If 'tis money--" began my father.

My great-uncle's gesture was sufficient check to this.

"I am not in difficulties for money, although I am like to be in
difficulties shortly in connection with an embarrassing quantity of
it.  In fine, sir, I am upon the point of launching the coup of my
career, one which will entail consequences of a stupendous character,
and in the end, I venture to predict, echo in throne-rooms and
chancelleries.  Aye, kingdoms shall----"

He broke off.

"It is not necessary that I should go into that.  Suffice it for the
present if I say that I am in the position of a man who has partially
tamed an unwieldy band of wild animals.  My own ship I can rely upon
up to a certain point, but I have associated with me----"

"That would be Flint?" interjected my father.

"I am flattered by the knowledge of my affairs which you display,"
replied my great-uncle with one of his courtly inclinations.  "Yes; I
had occasion, when I first went to sea, for a competent navigator.
Flint served me in that capacity until I became independent, and I
then fitted him out with his own ship.  We have cruised in company
since.  I am not betraying a professional secret when I add that he
is a man whose undoubted force of personality is offset by a certain
turbulence and crudeness of wit which make him difficult to
handle--increasingly difficult to handle, I may say.  I foresee
trouble with him in the future in connection with the coup to which I
have already refered."

"And is it your idea," inquired my father sarcastically, "that we
should undertake to assassinate this man for you--out of the kindness
of our hearts, as it were, and to stimulate the practise of piracy?"

Murray shook his head, wholly undisturbed.

"I never remove a man I can use," he answered.  "Flint is still
useful.  No, I require a young man to stand at my elbow and assist me
in curbing unruly spirits.  I promise a great future for such."

"Command of his own pirate craft, no doubt?" pressed my father.

"That would be an offer to draw most stout youths," returned my
great-uncle.  "Bah, what is piracy, that you and your kind prate
against it, Ormerod?  Is it any worse in character than four-fifths
of the business practised in this world?  What are you and those like
you but men who seek to deprive others of their lawful gains that you
may add to your stores what the others possessed?  I take from the
wealthy, who can afford to lose, what they have dishonestly got, more
often than not, and much of what I win I contribute to the Cause to
which you gave your first loyalty."

"An admirable code of ethics," observed my father.

"'Tis as good as any I have discovered," agreed Murray smoothly.
"You called me an outlaw a few minutes past.  I can not deny it.  I
am an outlaw because I worked in my own way to reëstablish my lawful
king.  You, who once served that king in exile, turned against him
and ruined me, made an outlaw of me.  Well, I do what I may; and
since Morgan's day no man has played the game so successfully, as any
seaman would tell you."

"I'll vouch for that," said my father.  "But come to the point.  What
will you have?  That I should apprentice Robert to you to be
indentured a good, honest, trusty and skilful pirate?"

"Even so."

My father sat back in his chair.

"I'll not," he said.

Murray treated himself to a pinch of snuff.

"What does our young man himself say?" he asked.

"I say that you offer me no inducement," I answered as shortly as I
could.

"'Odslife," he swore.  "No inducement?  My dear nephew, I offer you
an open, bracing life--for a brief space; a share in a brave venture;
an opportunity to rehabilitate your family, to rise to place, title
and honor."

"On a pirate's deck?" I jeered.

"From a pirate's quarterdeck," he corrected me gravely.  "I am on my
last cruise.  The _Royal James_ is to vindicate her name.  Aye, in
years to come she will be regarded as a shrine of loyalty and
devotion, and to have sailed with Andrew Murray in her----  Why, sir,
who remembers to-day of Robin Hood aught but that he was true to King
Richard in adversity?"

The man's surety was amazing.

"This passes all reason," said my father wearily.  "You must be
insane."

"Not at all," retorted my great-uncle.  "I am the leading
practitioner of my profession.  Winter, Davis, Roberts, Bellamy, all
the more noted--ah--pirates of recent years, were small fry compared
to me.  You would find it difficult to credit me did I inform you of
my takings----"

"Blood-money!" roared my father.  "Thieves' money!"

"Ah, that unfortunate point of view of yours again," protested
Murray.  "I tell you, Ormerod, you stand in the boy's way."

"He is not a boy, but a man," snapped my father.  "And able to judge
his own course."

"So be it."

My great-uncle turned to me once more.

"It appears this decision is left betwixt us two, Nephew Robert," he
said.  "So I must inform you that I am determined to have your aid in
any event--by force, if you will not accompany me reasonably."

There was a snap as a Brazil-nut split apart in Peter's grip.  Murray
waved an airy hand in his direction.

"'Tis true that you are the most powerful man I ever met, Corlaer,"
he remarked; "yet I urge you not to attempt violence.  I have
sufficient men in the house to overpower you, and I should not
hesitate to slay Ormerod or you at need.  The boy is the only one of
you three whose life hath value to me."

"He means it, Peter," said my father.  "Keep your hands down."

"_Ja_," squeaked Peter.

"You were ever a wise man, Ormerod," resumed my great-uncle.  "I
venture to congratulate you upon the soundness of your judgment.  Now
for you, Nephew Robert.  Come with me you shall, but I prefer that
you come willingly.  Therefore I lay before you these inducements:
Firstly, we sail upon a venture which hath a color of State business,
although a strict legalist would denounce it piratical--you see, I
endeavor to deal honestly by you after my fashion; secondly, no harm
is intended to you; thirdly, the rewards of our project will be
singularly rich; fourthly, I design to exploit the advantages which
shall accrue to me solely for your benefit--you, Robert, are my heir,
and if I have need of you in the execution of my coup, nonetheless I
shall be able to repay you for whatever you do in my behalf a
hundredfold, both materially and otherwise.  I am, after all, your
nearest kin after your father, and I say in all humility my
assistance is not to be despised."

From his manner you would have reckoned he was offering me the
governorship of a province, at the least; and the undeniable charm of
the man invested his words with a glamour which was augmented by the
virility of his person--and this notwithstanding my fast-rising
hatred of him.

"I won't go willingly," I answered.  "Even did your arguments tempt
me, I should resent your threat of compulsion."

"Admirably spoken," he applauded.  "Egad, I perceive you have the
proper spirit.  You are exactly the lad I require."

I rose, whipped to wrath by the insolence of his assurance.

"I am the lad you'll not get," I shouted.  "Call in your bravos, and
I'll tear their throats out for you."

"Gently, gently," he remonstrated.  "My bravos, as you term them, are
not lambs, Nephew Robert, and I must warn you that the killings would
not be all on the one side.  If you value your father, stand fast."

And he drew from a waistcoat pocket a silver whistle, which he placed
to his lips.  A thin blast piped through the room, and a dozen hairy
seadogs surged in from hall and kitchen.  Raps on the two windows
indicated that others mounted guard outside.

Peter Corlaer's little pig-eyes swept the invaders with a single
glance, but he did not suspend for a second his steady crushing and
munching of nuts.  My father's face was a mask of mingled rage and
fear--not fear for himself, but for me.  He stared at the savage
figures, the bared cutlasses, the ready pistols, almost with unbelief
in the reality of his vision.  And certes 'twas a weird spectacle in
that orderly house in the town we of the province looked upon as the
most advanced in the colonies--and became to me the more weird as I
glimpsed next the hall door a grim mahogany face and a hangman look
beneath a skrim of black hair, and behind the two a familiar carroty
head.

"Ho, there, Darby!" I called out.  "What are you doing in such
company?  Did you know those men for pirates, when you drank with
them at the Whale's Head?"

"Sure, they ha' taken me into their crew," he answered brazenly.

"Have you turned pirate, Darby?" says my father, seeing him for the
first time.

"Oh, aye," said Darby with a swagger.  "I'm as cruel wicked as any."

"And 'twas you let them into the house and betrayed your master!"
returned my father sadly.  "I had not expected this of you, Darby.
Have we not been kind to you?"

Darby wiggled uncomfortably.

"Oh, aye; main kind, Master Ormerod," he admitted.  "But they would
ha' had ye, whether or no.  Sure, they're a grand, tricksy crew.  And
anyway, ye see, I was born to be a pirate.  My troth, I was!"

Murray laughed pleasantly.

"'Tis a valiant youth, and should go far," he observed.  "Moreover,
he speaks the truth when he says we should have won our way in to you
without his aid.  The accommodation was convenient, but by no means
essential.

"Where is Silver, Master Bones?" he added.

The man with the mahogany face touched his hat.

"John was seeing to it the sarvants was all secure, sir," he
answered.  "Here he is now."

A gap appeared in the ranks by the kitchen door, and the one-legged
man I had met on the water-front that morning stumped in on his long
crutch, as cheerfully serene as any honest householder.

"Was you askin' for me, captain?" he said.  "We just finished up
behind there--all gagged and roped, Bristol-fashion, safe for a day,
sir."

And to me----

"My duty, Master Ormerod, and I hopes we'll know each other better
soon."

"I find we shall need a cart, John," said my great-uncle.

"Rambunctious, is he?" answered Silver with a wink.  "Well, we has it
all ready, and the tarpaulin over it, right here in the garding under
the blessed apple-trees.  'Tis only a step to the boats, to be sure."

My father turned very pale.

"You--you--  My God, Murray, you can't kidnap the boy this way!
Think!  There are troops in Fort George.  Once the hue and cry is
raised you'll be----"

"But it will not be raised," replied Murray calmly.  "I regret it,
but we shall be obliged to tie up you and Peter so that you will be
incapacitated until some kind friend happens to call on the morrow.
By that time we shall be at sea."

"You are mad!" cried my father.  "Every frigate on the station will
be after you."

My great-uncle chuckled mildly.

"That is an old sensation.  I have known it for twenty-odd years."

I snatched up the chair upon which I had been sitting and brandished
it over his head.

"Call off these scoundrels of yours or I'll batter out your brains,"
I snarled.

"John," he said, ignoring me, "you will be so kind as to pistol the
elder Master Ormerod if his son launches a blow at me."

"Aye, aye, sir," answered Silver.

And he leveled a weapon at my father.  I knew, without looking behind
me, that Peter and I were covered by other men.  It was Peter who
spoke first.

"Put down der chair, Bob," he ordered quietly.

The man called Black Dog cast the noose of a rope over his head and
jerked his arms close to his side.

"_Neen, neen,_" objected Peter, and with no visible effort he snapped
the hempen strands.

A gasp went up from the room, and there was a hasty retreat from his
neighborhood.

"Pistol that man, if you must," called Murray; "but use your
cutlasses, if possible."

"_Neen_," said Peter again.  "We don't fight."

"We might as well be killed now as let them carry off Bob," said my
father with a sob in his voice.

"_Neen_," said Peter a third time.  "Deadt, you stay deadt.  Perhaps
Bob gets away from them some time.  Better he be with Murray than he
be deadt."

"Intelligently logical," commented Murray.  "I commend the sentiment
to you, Nephew Robert."

Peter's little eyes glinted toward him.

"I go with Bob," he said.

"No, no," denied Murray quickly.  "You were not invited, friend
Peter."

"If I don't go, Robert don't go," replied Peter.  "Andt you don't go.
Perhaps I don't kill you, but if there is shooting you don't get
away.  _Ja_!"

Murray contemplated this speech.

"Your proposition then," he said, "is that you insist upon sharing my
nephew's new career or else will endeavor to secure the deaths of all
of us, including his and your own?"

"_Ja_!" answered Peter.

"You may come," decided my great-uncle.  "Your muscles should prove
useful.  John, I fancy we shall require triple bonds on this
prisoner."

"Aye, aye, sir," assented Silver.  "We ha' plenty o' stout manila.
One o' you lads run back and get those coils I left by the stove.
That's the proper spirit, Darby.  Always willin'.  You'll make a rare
hand, you will.  And how about makin' fast that gentleman as is goin'
to stay behind, captain?"

Murray looked at my father, and from him to me.

"Have you reconciled yourselves to what I may justly style the
inevitable?" he inquired suavely.

My father collapsed into his chair with a groan.

"If you will not suffer the boy to be hurt!" he exclaimed.

"My word of honor to that," returned my great-uncle very seriously.
"His comfort and safety rank ahead of my own, Ormerod, for I
anticipate that he is to achieve all those triumphs which fate denied
me.  'Tis true I hope to sample them briefly, but--" and for the
first time a shadow clouded his face--"I am, as you doubtless know,
in my sixty-fourth year, and a fickle Providence, regarding the
divinity of which I am inclined to share the skepticism of the French
philosophers, is scarce likely to indulge me in a very prolonged
extension of life's span.  Nor indeed would I have it otherwise.  I
feel no inclination for the senility of extreme age."

My father eyed him with unaffected puzzlement.

"You are a strange man, Murray.  I would I might understand you."

"You can not, so why concern yourself?  Well, time passes.  We must
be off.  Do you submit?"

My father bent his head.

"Yes--for his sake, ---- you!  Robert, no violence.  We are in a coil
we can not escape for the present; but rest assured I will do
everything I can to secure your release."

My great-uncle motioned Silver forward.

"Make Master Ormerod as comfortable as possible, John," he
instructed.  "Yes, tie him in his chair.  By the way, Ormerod,
touching your last observation, I would remind you that every shot
fired at my ship will be as likely to strike Robert as another.
Accept my advice, and leave well enough alone.  Within a year,
possibly--two, at most--the boy will be safe and advanced in fortune
beyond your wildest dreams."

"Let me have him back as he is--'tis all I ask," groaned my father.

Murray took snuff.

"A highly correct attitude, sir," he remarked.  "Have you more to
say?  Very well, John; you may affix the gag.  No, not that
gunnysacking.  Here is a silken kerchief will do.  And now, friend
Peter, we turn to you--and you, Nephew Robert.  I would these
precautions were unnecessary.  Let us trust your inclinations will
become more friendly toward me upon closer acquaintance."




CHAPTER IV

AN INKLING OF THE PLOT

My poor father's face, with the tears standing in his eyes, was the
last object I saw in the wan light of the guttering candles.  The
next moment my captors lugged me into the darkness of the garden and
pushed me upon a hand-cart such as was used to fetch up the frailer
kinds of merchandise from the docks.  Peter's immense body already
occupied most of the cart's cramped space, and I was squeezed
precariously between him and the near side, the which Silver
perceiving he prodded Peter into a more restricted compass and then
spread a tarpaulin over both of us.

"There ye are, my gentlemen," he said cheerfully.  "Safe as a round
of beef and a side o' pork, says you--and you says right.  Ah,
captain, we're ready here whenever you are, sir."

"Proceed then, John," answered my great-uncle's voice.  "You remember
the way?  The Green Lane,[1] 'tis called.  Four men should be
sufficient to accompany you.  I will go on by another street with the
rest of our party."


[1] Maiden Lane.


"Don't ye worry yourself, captain," returned Silver.

Footsteps thudded away on the gravel, and I heard the scratching of
the one-legged man's crutch as he stumped in front of us and the cart
jolted forward.  They evidently went out the back way into a little
alley, where their exit was least likely to be observed, and paused
while Silver reconnoitred the Green Lane from its cover.

"Not a sail in sight," he said presently.  "Dash my buttons what a
night!  Precious dark it is, and I'm main glad we didn't fetch Pew
along, with his bleared deadlights to hold us back.  Come along,
Black Dog.  Yarely, my hearties!  If this breeze keeps up----"

We emerged into the Green Lane, heading toward the East River, and a
thrill tickled my spine as I heard the chanting tones of old Diggory
Leigh, our ward watchman.

"Ten o'clock of a clear, dark night, and the wind in the nor'west.
And all's well!"

"Easy, all!" whispered Silver's voice.  "Push on, ye swabs; push on!
But hold your gab.  I'll do the talking."

The steel piece on the butt of his crutch tinkled on the cobbles as
he stumped ahead of the cart.

"Ho there, shipmate," he hailed cordially.  "And does you do this the
whole, livelong night?"

Diggory's lanthorn-stave jingled on the ground.  "I do," he returned
in pompous tones.  "What keeps you abroad so late?  Y'are seafaring
men, I judge."

"Now I calls that clever," protested Silver with unconcealed
admiration.  "You sees us in the dark, and straight: off you says,
'seafaring men.'  I can see you're a vigilant watchman, shipmate.
I'd hate to be a neefarious fellow in your town.  Blow my
scuttle-butt, I would!"

Diggory's appreciation of this tribute was mirrored in his voice.

"'Tis essential that our citizens be protected," he answered.  "Yet
there are those who have accused me of sleeping on watch."

"Skulkers, they be--low-lived skulkers as ever was," Silver assured
him.  "I know how you feel.  Here we've been a-workin' since sunup,
a-shiftin' cargo and stowin' it aboard, and I'll lay you a piece of
eight the captain never so much as sarves out a extry noggin o' rum."

Diggory's stave jingled again as he sloped it over his shoulder.

"The wisest men are not always those in authority, friend," he said.
"Ye might think, from the way some of the Corporation talk, 'twas
they bar the night-walkers and wastrels from the city's streets!
Bah!"

And his wailing voice receded into Pearl Street.

"What are you night-walkers and wastrels a-sniggerin' about?"
demanded Silver of his following.  "George Merry, I'll lay into you
with my crutch.  Put some heft behind this here blessed cart.  Ain't
ye ashamed o' yourselves, a-laughin' at a brave, hard-workin'
watchman as keeps wicked pirates from liftin' your goods?"

A few hundred feet farther on we rattled off the cobbles on to the
planked surface of a wharf.

"That you, John?" growled a voice.

"Aye, aye, Bill.  Where's the captain?"

"Gone off in the jollyboat.  That 'ere Spanish Irisher is a-waitin'
him aboard."

I heard Silver curse under his breath.

"What was you sayin', John?" asked the other man.

"What I was sayin' don't signify, but what I was thinkin' was that
there's a deal o' mystery in this business," answered Silver with an
edge to his tone.  "But there!  Why should I consarn myself as am no
more'n quartermaster o' the old _Walrus_?  You're Flint's mate, Bill,
and if it don't tickle your dignity to risk your neck without knowin'
what the stake is, why should I complain?"

The other man, whom I now identified as the very brown-faced fellow
who had been sitting with Darby in the Whale's Head, replied with a
string of oaths.

"----!" he wound up.  "Flint hisself don't know much more'n you and
me."

"He'll take a lot for a sizzlin', gut-cuttin' fire-eater," rejoined
Silver.  "I'm ---- if I'd eat the humble-pie as is his reg'lar diet.
Look at what we been through already!  First off we leaves a safe
hangout and a rich cruisin'-ground by Madagascar.  Then we barges off
from an ekally safe lay on the Main.  And his bloomin' lordship, not
trustin' his own crew, calls a fo'csle council aboard the _Walrus_
and asks for volunteers to go with him into New York!"

"No, no," struck in Bones--I could tell him by his voice, which was
of a peculiarly hectoring, rasping timbre.  "'Twas Flint would have
him take _Walrus_ men along, not trustin' what he was up to.  I heard
what was said, John, for Flint had me into the cabin at the end.

"'If you won't say no more, Murray, you won't,' says he.  'I know you
well enough for that.  And as for your ---- political combinations
they mean nothin' to me 'nless there's money in 'em for my pocket.
But I say flatly I won't trust you by your lone in New York; no, nor
with only men of your own choosin'.  How do I know you maybe won't
sell me for your pardon?'"

Silver pulled the tarpaulin from over our heads.

"If Flint said that 'twas the best speech he ever made," he returned.
"All I knows is that Murray came on deck before us all and says as
how he has a mission of danger to perform and he knowed there was no
daredevils like the old _Walrus_ hands, and would a score volunteer?

"'For what do we volunteer, captain, if I may make so bold?' says I.

"'A fair question merits a fair answer, John,' says he.  'And I'll
say to all you lads I'm planning a cruise as'll make the fortune of
the last one o' you and set us in such a position that those as
desires to go ashore and enjoy their ease in comfort can look to
receiving free pardons.'

"'Ah, yes, sir,' says I; 'but what might be the nature o' this
cruise, and why does we go into New York, where there's sojers, and
maybe King's ships?'

"'The sojers won't hurt you, John,' says he, 'and if there's King's
ships we'll try again.  We are goin' in for me to meet one man for a
talk under cover, and while I'm a-meetin' of him we'll crimp a likely
youth I have my eye upon.'

"And that was all I had out o' him, Bill.  I volunteered for blind
curiosity, hopin' for to discover what he was up to, and I'm free to
say I've had my trouble for my pains."

"You're no worse off'n the rest o' us," growled Bones.  "Belay that
guff, and get these carcases aboardship.  If we miss the ebb there'll
be ---- to pay.  He's no friend o' mine, Murray; but he's kept me in
rum and 'backy and spendin'-money since I joined up with him."

"Give Flint some o' the credit, Bill," objected Silver.

"I give him plenty," snarled Bones.  "He's a rare fighter, Flint is.
But he never had Murray's head to plan--and he knows that as well as
me.  Aye, for I've heard him say it.

"'Curse me if I like to bob and prance for the old hellion, Bill,'
says he; 'but he has the skill o' the Fiend at our lay.  He's lasted
twice as long as me or any other.'"

"Skill is right," admitted Silver.  "D'ye mind, when we was
overhaulin' the brig, he ran up alongside the _Walrus_ wi' his
speakin'-trumpet out and hailed?

"'Ahoy, _Walrus_!' says he.  'Don't touch her spars or riggin'.  Give
her a couple o' round shot across her decks.  We've got to get rid of
her crew, anyway."

He chuckled enviously.

"But this isn't gettin' us all back to the _Walrus_, Bill," he added.
"Here, George Merry, can't you and your mates handle the big fellow?
Two to his head and two to his feet--and drop him easy or he'll stove
in the boat.  Now, my gentleman--" this to me--"we'll pass you down,
too.  You must pull a strong oar with the captain for him to be so
anxious to get you offshore hale and whole.  It'll be place and rank
for you, messmate, or a chance to swim wi' the sharks.

"Where's the red-headed little Irisher, Bill?"

"I sent him off with the captain," replied Bones.  "Down wi' you,
John.  We'll cast off."

From where I now lay, propped up in the bow with my head resting on
Peter's huge stomach, I could see the wharf a few feet above and the
vague figures of the pirates and behind them the shadowy outline of
the warehouses and an occasional dim light.  Silver--I knew him by
his height and a certain hunching of the shoulder under which he
rested his crutch--turned away as Bones addressed him.

"What of the cart?" he asked.

"That's easy," returned Bones.

And he gave it a shove that sent it splashing into the water off the
wharf's end.

"No incriminatin' evidence or what the lawyer sharks calls clues,"
remarked Silver.  "A good job well done, Bill, if you asks me."

He lowered himself to a seat upon the stringpiece of the wharf,
dropped the butt of his crutch to the forward thwart, felt about with
his one leg and came to rest in front of Peter and me.  The crutch he
allowed to slip to the bottom of the boat, and in its place he took
an oar.  Bill Bones found a seat in the stern sheets.

"All clear," muttered Bill.  "Give way."

The oars fended off from the wharf, and the boat crept out into the
stream, where it felt the full strength of the tide, just beginning
to turn.  The bow bounced up as the first wave hit it, and Peter,
beneath me, emitted a dismal groan through his gag.  Silver, bending
diligently to his oar, looked over his shoulder.

"You would come, messmate," he said.  "'Tis nobody's fault but your
own."

Peter gave a convulsive wiggle which almost knocked me out of the
boat.

"Here, here," admonished Silver.  "That's no way to act.  D'ye want
to drown us all?"

Another groan from Peter, and he lay still.

"Look sharp," called Bones.  "The brig's just ahead."

A riding-light gleamed high above us in the velvet gloom.  I heard
the faint _slap-slap-slap_ of water against an anchored hull.  Other
lights appeared, the square pattern of stern windows, a great
lanthorn hung in the waist.  A gruff hail reached us.

"Boat ahoy!"

"Bones comin' aboard."

"Aye, aye, Bill."

As we rounded under her counter a couple of ropes rattled down to us,
and I heard the creaking of tackle and hoist.  We ground against the
dripping black hull, and one of the oarsmen seized the rungs of a
ladder which dribbled in the waves.

"Make fast the young 'un first," rasped Bones as he went up the
wooden rungs monkey-fashion.

"Aye, aye, Bill," answered Silver, and I became conscious that the
one-legged man and another were knotting a loose rope beneath my
arm-pits.  "All right, above there," called Silver presently.

And to me as the block began to whine:

"Watch out for your head, my master.  Up you go!  All the sensations
as come to a poor, honest pirate as is hung in chains at Execution
Dock."

The rope tautened; the unseen block whined louder; and I rose
involuntarily from my position across Peter's belly.  My feet were
jerked from a thwart, and I kicked the air.  The grunts of men
hauling in unison floated from the brig's deck, and as I rose faster
I commenced to swing like a pendulum.

And now I understood Silver's warning as to my head, for I came into
violent collision with the brig's hull and by mere luck escaped with
a bruised shoulder instead of a broken skull.  I would have cried
out, I think, but the gag restrained me; and inside of a minute I was
dangling over the bulwarks, feet kicking frantically for standing
room.  A man caught me by one arm and drew me inboard, shouting the
while to "slacken away!" and so I came down again with a bump that
was like to crack my knee-caps, deposited as so much cargo upon the
pitchy deck.

Dazed by treatment I had never sustained before, I stood heedless as
the ropes were unfastened beneath my arm-pits, my bonds slipped off
and the gag extracted from my aching jaws.  I was just beginning to
take in the aspect of my surroundings when Corlaer's cask of a body
topped the bulwarks, swung with ludicrous unconcern for an instant as
I dare say mine had done and then lurched in and crashed to the deck.
The Dutchman was purple in the face, with white spots dotting the
congested area of his cheeks, and gasping for breath.  His stomach
heaved tumultuously as the gag was removed.

"What ails you, Peter?" I cried.

"Der water," he moaned.  "It makes me sick."

And sick he was--violently.

I helped him to the side as a whistle trilled.

"Capstan men for'ard," shouted a voice.

"What d'ye say?" called Bill Bones.  "Who ordered the anchor up?  The
longboat's still alongside."

"Captain's orders," rumbled the answer from the darkness.  "Said to
cat the anchor, Bill, and get sail on her.  We'm to start so soon as
the Spanisher goes off--his boat's under the sta'b'd gangway."

Bones ripped off an admirable stream of oaths.

"Might ha' told me," he complained.  "Slack aft the longboat, a pair
o' you.  Is the jollyboat hove up?  Aloft, topmen!  Clear the braces.
John, you'd better take the helm.  I s'pose his lordship'll come up
to con us out when he gets good and ready, seein' he's the only one
o' us as knows his way about this blasted harbor!"

"Aye, aye, Bill."

Silver stumped out of the shadow for'ard into the glare of the big
lanthorn that swung from a lower yard of the mainmast over the waist.

"But what about our pris'ners?" Silver asked.

Mr. Bones cast an uneasy glance at us.

"I can't have that there bloomin' volcano a-muckin' up the decks, let
alone cabin or fo'csle.  Leave 'em be, John.  They can't do no harm,
and any man as goes into that water tonight will freeze before he
makes the shore."

"Spoke most accurate," Silver agreed in his cheerful way.

The rascal had a manner which contrived to invest whatever he said to
you--to any one--with the implication that you were the most
intelligent person he had ever had to do with and that it was an
honor to obey and serve you.

He disappeared aft now, and Bones with him.  I heard the latter
continuing to shout orders; and there was a constant bustle of men
running back and forth over the decks, a clattering of ropes and
shrieking of falls and blocks.  For-'ard sounded an ordered trampling
of feet and a chorus of rough voices bellowing the wild sea-song I
had heard in the Whale's Head Tavern:

  "Fifteen men on the Dead Man's Chest--
    Yo-ho-ho, and a bottle of rum!
  Drink and the devil had done for the rest--
    Yo-ho-ho, and a bottle of rum!"


Corlaer, weak as a rag, sank in a heap of buckskin in a dark corner
by the bulwarks.

"_Neen, neen,_" he answered when I would have helped him.  "Not'ings,
Bob.  I get better by and by.  Der salt water--it is always so with
me."

"I'll get you some rum," I said firmly.

And, rising, I was on the point of seeking the nearest man to ask
where a drink might be obtained when footsteps clicked on the deck
behind me.

"They are a dangerous company," said a voice with an unmistakable
brogue to it.

"What would you?" returned my great-uncle.

I could imagine the graceful shrug which went with the words.

"We could not employ his Majesty's people in such a business.  And
all things considered, my fellows can handle it far better and more
expeditiously."

They passed through the rays of the lanthorn which swung from the
mainyard.  Aye, the first speaker was Colonel O'Donnell.  The little
Irish maid!  His daughter.  My father had been right in his
suspicions.

But what could be the tie of interest between a colonel in the Army
of the King of Spain and an outlaw who had defied the whole structure
of civilization?  A Jacobite plot?  It seemed preposterous!

"'Tis my daughter I was thinking of," explained O'Donnell as they
reached the starboard gangway close by where I stood over Peter's
prostrate form.

"Ah!"

My great-uncle went through his courtly formula of taking snuff, and
I watched him, fascinated.

"Your forebodings do you credit, _chevalier_.  But you have no cause
for concern.  For reasons which I need not go into I have with me
here men from the crew of my associate.  On board the _Royal James_ I
think I may promise you and your daughter all the deference you might
receive upon a King's ship.  I will go so far as to say that I have
taken steps to secure you additional protection.  My
great-nephew--and heir--of whom I have spoken to you, sails with me,
a fine youth who shall yet make his mark in the world."

"But a woman on a pirate ship!" protested O'Donnell anew.

"My dear sir, Rule Four of the Code of Articles under which our
company is governed--does it surprize you that we have our own
laws?--forbids the taking and keeping of women as spoil aboard our
ships.  We have had experience in the past of the evils which flow in
the wake of a struggle for women's favors."

"Shall you not flout your own rule if my daughter comes aboard?"
pressed the Irishman.

"She will not come as a prisoner, but as a guest," returned Murray
blandly.  "After all, colonel, the _Royal James_ is my ship--and in
that respect differs from most outlaw craft which are held by the
entire crew as a community.  No, no; you need not concern yourself."

"I like it not, I say!" persisted O'Donnell.  "Why did you bid me
bring her?  You were hot for her coming so soon as you heard I had a
daughter."

"Would you have left her by her lone in a strange country?" answered
my great-uncle impatiently.  "Tut, man, be sensible.  Who would
suspect a man who had his daughter with him?  'Tis true this
enterprise is fraught with danger, but no maid can go through life
without sniffing peril.  We will guard her as we shall the treasure."

"I'll hold you to that," rapped O'Donnell as he climbed over the
bulwarks and felt for the ladder.  "I am not proud of myself when I
think of her innocence.  Holy saints, what a coil!  Well, well, no
matter.  I must be going, for the night wanes."

"Yes," assented Murray.  "And stir your frigate's captain to a swift
passage."

The Irishman nodded.

"If necessary we'll pass by the Havana.  Luckily Porto Bello is the
_intendente's_ chief worry.  You'll hover, then, off Moria Passage?"

"Aye, from the south tip of Hispaniola to the north of Porto Rico,
save it storms, when we'll run for shelter in the Bay of Samana,
where the old buccaneers were wont to lie.  Diego can find us.  He
has done it before.  Just give him ample time."

"So soon as the _Santissima Trinidad_ has her orders Diego shall
know."

He started to descend and then climbed back.

"She has heavy metal, Murray.  Are you certain----"

My great-uncle laughed.

"Be at ease upon that point, _chevalier_.  We could take two
Spaniards of the _Santissima Trinidad's_ metal.  I fear I must bid
you good evening, though.  Hark!"

The bell of the Spanish frigate rang out eight times.

"Midnight!" exclaimed O'Donnell.  "Can you be gone by dawn?"

"My dear sir," returned my uncle lightly, "this brig will never be
seen again--anywhere--by anybody."

O'Donnell shivered.

"Good night," he said abruptly, and his head vanished behind the
bulwarks.

I heard the rattle of oars, a low order in Spanish, the steady splash
and spatter of rowers as the boat pulled away.  My great-uncle
watched it for a moment, then turned toward where I stood.

"Well, Nephew Robert, what did you make of us?" he inquired.

I contrived to keep my voice level, for I would not give him the
satisfaction of supposing he had startled me.

"That you are engaged in deeper villainy even than my father feared."

"You have a narrow-minded view of life," he remarked.  "However, 'tis
a defect can be remedied by experience.  By the way, do not jump to
conclusions from what you overheard.  You shall have the whole tale
anon, but until you possess a more intimate knowledge of the
situation you are better off in ignorance."

"I am no pirate, nor shall I be."

"Why make hasty statements, Robert?"

A hail came from Bones for'ard.

"Anchor a-cat, captain!"

"Very good, Master Bones," replied my great-uncle.  "You may trip,
and we will make all sail, if you please."

"Aye, aye, captain."

Peter groaned dolefully at the fateful words, and Murray stepped
closer.

"What is that beside you, Robert?" he asked quickly.  "Did our good
friend Peter come to harm?"

"The water's motion sickens him."

"Ah!  Strange how the strongest men succumb to it.  We will have him
carried below.  I should have told you before this that I design to
make you both as comfortable as possible.  You berth aft with me.  On
the brig I can offer you very limited hospitality, but on the _Royal
James_ you shall have the comforts of an admiral."

"I want no comforts," I answered coldly.  "Any comforts you may offer
me would be a mockery.  My very being here is a discomfort most
insufferable."

He stiffened.

"'Sdeath, sirrah!  Bear in mind that I am your elder in years and
deserving of respect for my relationship."

"To me you are a singularly bloody pirate, and that is all."

"The injustice of youth!" he commented evenly.  "I was the uncle and
tender guardian of the mother you never knew, Robert."

"I share my father's feelings upon that point," I cried, and raised
my hand in a threatening gesture.

He did not stir.

"Your conversion will be quite as difficult as I had foreseen," he
said.  "No, you would gain naught by striking me.  Impartially I may
recommend you to adopt an attitude which will secure you the maximum
of liberty and opportunity.  Of what avail for you to force yourself
into confinement?"

"Sir," I returned, "be convinced of this: The day you attack a
defenseless ship I will slay as many of you as I can and contentedly
die."

It has a sound of theatricalism now, but I meant it at the time.

"I purpose nothing of that sort for you," answered my great-uncle.
"And while I am tempted to argue you out of a position founded upon a
false ethical basis, I shall content myself with the observation that
you would do well to hold your temper in leash until you find a need
for its employment."

He glanced overside.

"I see we are under way.  I must ask you to excuse me for the
present, Robert.  I am constrained to serve as pilot."

He raised his little silver whistle, and its shrill call fetched
several of the crew aft.

"Aye, aye, captain."  It was Bones.  "What's your wish, sir?"

"Have this poor fellow--" Murray gestured toward Corlaer's recumbent
form--"carried to one of the staterooms.  Use him gently.  Bid the
Irish boy--what's his name?  Oh, Darby!--bid Darby tend him and fetch
him what he requires.

"This gentleman, here--" he indicated me--"is my great-nephew, Master
Bones.  It may be he will succeed me in command of the _Royal James_
some day, although he is not with us of his own wish as yet.  He is
to have complete freedom except he undertake to achieve aught to our
disadvantage.  Pass the word to the men, if you please."

"That's a queer lay," growled Bones.  "Is he friend or enemy,
captain?"

"An intelligent question," replied my great-uncle.  "We may call him
an enemy who is to be treated as nearly as possible as a friend."

"Blasted if I see any sense in it," affirmed Bones.  "But whatever
you says, captain."

"Exactly," said my great-uncle.

And to me he added:

"Oblige yourself, Robert.  There is a berth waiting for you, or you
may remain on deck and take a lesson in seamanship."

I cast my eye astern at the lights of New York, so low, so scattered,
already so far away.

"I'll go below and do what I may for Peter," I decided.

"As you choose," responded my extraordinary relative, and walked aft.

"Stir your stumps, ye lousy swabs," roared Bones to his men.  "Hitch
on to this here land-whale.  ---- my lights and gizzard if I ever see
such a monstrous heap o' human flesh!  We'd oughter take him to the
South Seas and sell him to the canneybals.  That's all he's good for.
Come on, young gentleman, you may be the captain's nevvy or by-blow
or whatever 'twas he called ye, but everybody works on this ship.
Lend a hand."

I obeyed him in silence, while he and the others cursed and
blasphemed with a fluency defying description.  What a company!
Except in Murray's presence they owned no discipline, accepted no
restraint.  Palpably they hated as well as feared him, and I found
myself wondering how secure a hold he had upon their passions.  Let
them once cast off the spell of his magnetism and superior
wickedness, and they would become so many irresponsible agents of
lust and destruction.

I shuddered and was glad of the hooded cabin-lamp as we stowed
Peter's limp body into the constricted space of a bunk; gladder still
when they tramped away and left me alone with the Dutchman.

Through a porthole the lights of New York winked farewell to me.  I
was as frightened as a child by himself for the first time in the
dark.




CHAPTER V

ABOARD THE BRIG

I woke with a ray of sunshine streaming across my face through the
thick, greenish glass of a deadlight and an odd feeling of
contentment.  Mice were cheeping in the paneling at my elbow; the
timbers and planking of the hull were groaning and snorting; there
was a soothing swissh-ssh of divided waters; and the brig herself was
swaying easily in a following sea.

Corlaer was sleeping the sleep of utter exhaustion, and I was at
pains not to disturb him as I slipped to the floor, opened the door
and entered the main cabin.  This was deserted save for the boy
Darby, who was curled up on the seat under the stern windows, peering
out at the brig's creamy wake.  He heard the door close after me and
swiveled round at once, landing lightly on his feet as if he had been
to sea for years.

"Och, Master Bob," says he, "I thought ye'd never wake up.  Ah, it's
the grand, grand day.  And do ye smell the brine in the air?  It
makes the toes of your two feet dance, whether ye will or no--troth,
it does."

'Twas impossible to nourish resentment against the boy for his
betrayal of us.  He was as naturally lawless and unmoral as a young
wolf, but I could not resist a jeer at his recent transformation.

"And how does it seem to be a pirate, Darby?"

"Oh, fine!  Sure, I always knew I wasn't intended for a bond-boy to
run errands and carry bales.  Ah, it's the grand life, Master Bob!
They tell me himself--" he jerked his thumb toward the door of a
stateroom opposite that in which Peter and I were berthed--"is own
uncle to ye, and some day, if ye choose, ye can be as great as him.
Faith, and I know what my choice would be!"

"Is it your idea that pirates never work?" I inquired.

His face fell a trifle.

"Och, there's work everywhere ye go, bad 'cess to it!  It's, 'Darby,
lend a hand here!'  Or, 'Darby, catch hold o' this rope!'  Or,
'Darby, fetch me a pannikin o' rum!'  Darby this and Darby that the
night long."

His face lightened again.

"But I'm to have my own cutlass and two pistols for my belt, and they
say I'm good luck."

"Good luck?  How's that?"

"Sure, it's my hair, I think.  Flint--him that this crew sail with by
usual--he has a liking for a red-headed lad.  Such as meself brings
him luck, so they swear, and Long John----"

"Who?"

"Long John--Master Silver, to be sure--him with the one leg we talked
to by the shore yesterday--he says I'll go far with Flint."

I had to laugh at my own bemusement at the picture Darby's remark
called up.  Yesterday morning at this hour I had been laboring
industriously in the counting-room in Pearl Street.  And how much had
happened since then!  I harked back to my setting-forth for the
Bristol packet, the casual conversation with the one-legged
mariner--how skilfully he had pumped me and annexed Darby to his
plot!--the encounter with the Irish maid----

With this I curbed my recollections.  Thought of Moira O'Donnell was
unpleasant, for I could not rid my mind of the suspicion that she
must be bound up in some way in the schemes her father worked at in
coöperation with my great-uncle.

But there!  I found relief in this reflection.  Certes, her father
could be no worse than my relative; and here was I, innocent of any
art or part in Murray's devious ploys, yet tossed into the grip of
their mechanism as ruthlessly as if my life depended upon his
success.  And perhaps it did.  What more natural, then, than that she
was equally innocent?  Aye, from the conversation betwixt the two
conspirators I had overheard the night before it appeared that she
was innocent, probably in greater ignorance of her father's plans
than I, else how explain O'Donnell's concern upon discovering the
character of the men with whom she was to be thrown in contact?

And this aroused a further recollection.  What was it the lass had
said as we parted?

"Here our paths diverge."

She would not have said that had she known all, for there had been no
necessity for the lie.  Doubt not, she was in entire ignorance of the
black evil these two plotted!  I was glad with a great burst of
exultation which must have shown itself in my face, for Darby
exclaimed:

"There was a good fairy flicked a wing over you, Master Bob!  Glory,
but ye had the happy thought.  Will ye throw in with us and be a
pirate chief?  Troth, there'd be no better."

"Not I, Darby; but I will have a bite to eat, if such there be aboard
a pirate craft."

"Lashin's of everything in nature," rejoined Darby briskly.  "Sit to
the table yon, and I'll fetch it from the galley."

The table was set and ready, not with coarse crockery and steel
forks, knives and spoons, but with dainty china, heavy silverware and
fine napery, too.  I commented on this when Darby returned, balancing
smoking dishes and a jug of hot chocolate upon a tray.

"'Tis the way himself--" his thumb indicated the starboard stateroom
door--"will live.  The best of everything he'll have, and on his own
ship nigger slaves to serve him, and they in liveries like grand
gentlemen have.  Whisht!"

His voice sank to a whisper.

"He's a terrible unchancy fellow, yon, Master Bob.  Not for all the
gold onzas Long John do be always talkin' of would I ha' _him_ for
uncle!  No, no!  I'll sail with Flint, rather.  The eye to him--and
the soft voice and quiet ways!  And him as swift to cut your throat
or walk ye down the plank as Flint; aye, and swifter!  I ha' the
creepies on my back whiles I look at him.

"Flint, now, he's main different, Long John says.  He'll swig rum wi'
any man, and if he wants your life ye'll be in no doubt of that same;
and he curses better'n Bill Bones."

"You seem to have experienced no trouble in becoming intimate with
your new companions, Darby," I remarked.

"It's me head does it," returned Darby, unabashed.  "As I told ye, it
brings good luck."

"Not to me," I retorted with a grin.

"And don't ye be too sure," he flashed.  "We'll maybe sail a long
ways together; and I'm your friend, Master Bob, for ye were never one
to let me be put upon in the counting-room."

"Humph," said I.  "That is to be seen.  Where is 'himself,' as you
call him?"

"Asleep in his berth.  Troth, he was up until dawn conning the brig
through the harbor shoals."

"Are we outside?"

"Sure, we're by and beyond what they call Sandy Hook.  There's only
the wide ocean in front."

"I'm for the deck then," I answered.  "Keep an ear on Master Corlaer,
Darby.  If he craves food fetch him some of this chocolate."

"Leave him to me," said Darby confidently.  "He's another I like
fine.  Wasn't it him brought me the Injun scalp and the knife wi'
blood on it?  Oh, ye must both turn pirate!  We'd make a grand crew,
just the three of us."

The companionway was empty, and I met nobody until I had climbed to
the deck.  The brig was running free before a smart nor'west breeze,
and there was just enough of a sea to toss an occasional shower of
spray over the bows.  The wind was booming in the hollow of the
sails, and the cordage sang like a great harp.  Sea-birds were
circling the mast-tops and skimming the waves with occasional raucous
cries.  And over all the sun cast a warm, golden radiance that held a
magic spell.

I understood now the contentment with which I had wakened, although
indeed 'twas passing strange that I so readily adapted myself to the
sea and its ways, seeing that all my life I had never been beyond the
waters of the inner harbor.  Yet 'tis the fact I had no discomfort or
misgiving and even acquired instinctively the sailor's tricks of
standing and walking, as was commented upon by no less an authority
than John Silver.

The deck was deserted for'ard.  One man was lashed in the main
cross-trees, sweeping the entire circuit of the horizon with a
spyglass.  Aft there were only Silver and another fellow at the
wheel.  The one-legged man waved to me with his crutch from his seat
on the cabin skylight.

"Come and talk with Long John, Master Ormerod," he called.  "Where
did ye find them sea-legs o' yourn?  You walk like a blasted admiral,
no less."

"I found them below," I answered, for the life of me unable to resist
the scoundrel's ingratiating manner.  "Where are the rest of your
company?"

He laughed and winked at the man at the wheel, an awful-looking
creature, so heavy of shoulder as to appear deformed, with a green
shade over deeply sunken eyes that were all pitted around with tiny
blue scars.

"Ha, ha!  Our young gentleman says to himself, says he: 'Only two on
deck, one on 'em wi' a single leg, t'other all but blind.  And here's
me as is young and sturdy.'  A clean field, says you, Master Ormerod;
but you're failin' to reckon on John's crutch, which same can be a
very nasty weapon at need; and if Pew's eyes don't see far he can
shoot by ear as well as most o' us by sight."

I shook my head.

"Rascals as thorough as you, Silver, would never leave an opportunity
like that.  'Tis true I have had no sea-service, but I have fought
with the savages upon our northern frontier.

"I'll not move until I see a clear path before me."

He laughed uproariously at this.

"Now that 'ere's a good joke on me!  Might ha' knowed you wasn't as
open as your face.  You'll learn fast, you will, Master Ormerod.
I'll lay four spade-guineas to that.  Bear over just a p'int, Ezra,
matey.  Aye, so!"

"Is that foretops'l drawin' full, John?" asked the man with the green
eye-shade in a voice that was singularly soft.

Silver squinted aloft.

"She'll do," he decided.

"Would you mind telling me how a blind man can steer?" I inquired.

The man with the green eye-shade chuckled in a way to chill your
blood, so sardonic, so overpoweringly evil was the caliber of the
mirth it suggested.

"A poor, blind man has to earn his bread and 'backy somehow, young
sir," he answered unctuously.

"Don't go to makin' up your mind Pew can't see everything, Master
Ormerod," said Silver, shifting his crutch.  "I'd hate to have him
decide to take a shot at me.  Steer?  Well now, what's needed in
steerin'?  A strong arm, says you, and you says true.  Also and
likewise, an ear for canvas.  Lastly and leastwise, an eye for the
course.

"Any man can read a compass, young gentleman; but not every sailorman
can feel how his ship takes the wind and meet his rudder quick when
she wants meetin'.  Pew can.  Give him some one like me to play eyes
for him, and he'll steer as straight a course as a packet-boat wi' a
bonus on the voyage."

"Are there many cripples in your crew?" I asked curiously.

"Cripples?" repeated Silver.  "It all depends on what you might mean.
There's cripples and cripples.  Me and Pew now, we got ours in the
same broadside.  'Twas a Injyman wi' a fighting master, and she stood
to us, board and board."

He slapped the stump of his thigh.

"An eighteen-pounder did that.  _Whoof_!  Off she went.  Pew, he was
rammin' home a charge and leaned out through the port and caught the
flash of a carronade.  'Tain't good for the eyes, nowise; but as I
was a-sayin', don't you ever go for to believe Pew can't see.  He's
surprizin', he is.

"But we was talkin' of cripples.  Yes, there's cripples and cripples.
Some on 'em ye pays their screw----"

"Their what?" I interrupted.

"Their screw, the what d'ye call it--insurance money.  So much we get
from the prize money extry for the hurt.  Pew, he got a thousand
pounds, which same he blowed in three nights in St. Pierre.  D'ye
mind, Ezra?  I got eight hundred pounds for my leg--and fair enough,
if you asks me.

"And that eight hundred pounds I'll gamble you ha' stowed away in a
safe hole, John," said Pew with a gentleness which gave the words a
peculiarly sinister significance.

Silver nodded almost complacently.

"What I gets, I keeps.  I'm none o' your free spenders, rich today,
poor tomorrow.  Some day I'll be retirin' from piratin', and then
I'll aim to ride in my own coach and sit in Parleyment."

"You'll have to sail your own ship first, John," said Pew, and the
remark was fraught with implications that made me turn cold at the
pit of my stomach.

It was as if you could see the trail of bloodshed and suffering
Silver would blaze to possess that ship and to exploit her to
advantage.

"And why not?" returned Silver vigorously.  "We'll name no names,
Ezra, but captains can't live for ever.  Some is aged and some soaks
theirselves in rum.  You never know!  You never know!"

"There's Bill Bones, as has ideas on the subjeck," remarked Pew.

And he contrived to make me feel the horror of a long-drawn-out feud
and rivalry.

"Yes, there's Bill," ruminated Silver.  "Flint's mate, is Bill.
Flint's best pal, is Bill.  Flint's confeydantey, some says, is Bill.
Well, well!  But we was talkin' o' cripples and how a blind man can
steer, which is a long way off from Bill, who isn't neither crippled
nor blind, and maybe has hopes, so he has, when he remembers that."

Pew laughed so coldly, with such demoniac inhumanity, that I
experienced a sudden fellow-feeling for Master Bones, distasteful as
I had found him--also, a pronounced desire to change the subject.
The bare proximity to such whole-souled, heartless cruelty was
unpleasant.

"Do you commonly indulge in exploits like yesterday's, Silver?" I
asked.

He cocked his head on one side.

"Exploits?  Yesterday?  Meanin' the disposition of yourself?  We-ell,
no, sir; not reg'larly, I'd say, Ezra."

"Not by a capful o' onzas," agreed Pew.

"I'm no man for makin' trouble," continued Silver, "but there's them
as might say the captain was a mite rash."

"Why don't you call him by his name?"

Silver gave me an odd look.

"There's some names as is better off unmentioned in conversation," he
said.  "We'll call him the captain, wi' your kind leave and
permission, sir."

"Call him what you please," I answered; "but I should think it was
insanity for men with your reputations to venture into New York.
Why, the second mate of that Bristol packet had seen Captain Murray,
and would have known him."

"Ah!" said Silver, grinning.  "But he didn't see the captain, which
is more to the point, my master; nor he wouldn't have had the chance
to see him in any case.  'Cause why?  'Cause the captain come ashore
most careful in the dusk wi' his cloak around his face and three
stout hearties to fend off inquisitive strangers."

"But the rest of you----"

"Now, Master Ormerod, what honest sailorman a-tremblin' for his life
is goin' to remember faces out o' a crew o' pirates he sees on a
shot-up deck?  All he thinks of, says you, is a lot of villains as
has likely slaughtered his mess-mates and looted his ship, and quite
right.  Why, I've been stood treat in Kingston by a skipper I'd
stripped two months past--but that was afore I lost my leg, which
bein' in other seas ain't as yet a mark of identification on me in
these parts."

"And did you take this ship designedly to carry you into New York?"

"You might say truthfully she was the best fitted for it of several,"
he acknowledged.  "Blow my other stick off if she was good for
anything else."

"Not forty pounds in her," mumbled Pew, twiddling the wheel-spokes.

"Her crew----"

Silver raised his eyebrows and gave me a slow wink.

"Poor unfortunates!  'Twas one time we couldn't take chances."

Pew's chuckle trickled icily from under the eye-shade which cast a
green blur over his whole lower face.

"I suppose there is a hell for such as you," I said, trying to keep
my voice steady.

"Some says there is and some says there isn't," answered Silver
reasonably.  "No use to worry, says I."

I was so wrought up that I think I must have come to blows with them
but for a fortunate diversion.  Bones and several other men emerged
from the fo'csle hatch, yawning and stretching their arms, evidently
having just arisen from sleep.  At the same moment Peter Corlaer
climbed from the cabin companionway, lurched for a moment, on his
feet and then staggered precariously toward the bulwarks.  I started
for'ard to aid him, and Bones ran aft with a loud yell.

"Don't ye spoil my decks, ye fat cow!" he shouted.

Poor Peter, regardless of both of us, seized a stay and clung to it
abjectly, quite helpless.  Bones reached him first and gave him a
shove which sent him plunging into the scuppers head first.

"Get up," snarled Bones, and dealt him a vicious kick with a heavy
sea-boot.

Peter groaned, and I caught Bones by the arm.

"---- you for a coward!" I shouted.  "Captain Murray bade you use us
gently.  Is this how you obey?"

He snatched free of me and yanked out a knife.

"Obey, ye lousy lubber!" he howled.  "I'm Flint's mate, and I'll show
ye who can say obey to me.  Get back there or I'll cut your heart out
and eat it afore ye."

I looked about me for a weapon, anxious to give him a lesson; but
there was not a sign of anything handy, and I backed away cautiously
from the menace of his knife.  He had been drinking through the night
on top of liberal potations during the previous day, and the effect
was to render him quite insensible to any rule now that his passions
were aroused.  Silver shouted to him to let us be, as did one or two
others; but his only answer was a string of the curses in which he
was so proficient, and he continued to circle after me.

For myself I was not greatly frightened, for, as it chanced,
knife-fighting was an art in which I was somewhat expert, thanks to
instruction from my father's Indian friends; but I was concerned lest
the scoundrel make a dart at Peter and slay the Dutchman as he lay
inert.  Judge of my amazement then when Peter swayed to his feet,
holding on to the bulwarks to pull himself erect.  His face was
white, but he abandoned his support without hesitation and advanced,
crooked-legged, across the deck toward us.

"I take him, Bob," he said.

I jumped between him and Bones in time to stop the pirate's rush,
dodging a knife-thrust by the width of my coat-sleeve.

"Keep away, Peter," I panted.  "I can handle him.  You can't.
You'll----"

"I take him," repeated Corlaer.

He reached out his hand, grasped my shoulder and spun me from his
path as easily as if I had been a child.  And I did not attempt to
return to his side, for I had felt the strength in his arm and knew
that I had no cause to question his ability to take care of himself
against any man, however armed.

Bones stared at him for a moment with a mixture of rage and surprize.

"D'ye want your ---- throat cut?" he sneered.  "Here, turn your head
and I'll take an ear instead.  There's naught in slaying a cow like
you."

Peter said nothing, simply stood there before him weaponless, arms
slightly bent, legs crooked at the knees.  The Dutchman's little
eyes, almost buried from sight in his face, glittered with a steely
menace.

"Let him be, Bill," called Silver again--was I wrong in fancying his
tone unduly officious, provocative?

"I'm ---- if I do," rasped Bones.  "If he wants it, he'll get it."

He sprang at Peter with knife upraised, aiming to slash his throat;
but Peter moved with lightning speed to counter him.  One immense
arm, thick as a tree-bough, shot out and imprisoned the wrist of the
knife-hand; a twist, and the knife pinged on the deck.  The other arm
captured a thigh, and Bones was reared above Peter's head.

Peter gave him a preliminary shake as if to prove to him how
completely he was in his power and started to walk back to the lee
bulwark.  Bones shrieked like the lost soul he was, certain that
Peter intended to cast him into the sea; but half-way across the deck
Peter came to a loose halyard.  He lowered Bones carelessly, tucked
him under one arm and proceeded to reeve a landsman's slip-noose.  We
all watched him with utter fascination, and it is an indication of
the pirates' code in such affairs that none of them intervened.  But
Peter was not to hang Master Bones.

"Your object is no doubt praiseworthy, Peter," remarked my
great-uncle from the cabin companionway behind us, "but I fear I must
request you to let the man go.  He is of some value to a friend of
mine."

Peter regarded Murray curiously.

"He knifes Robert and me--_ja_," answered the Dutchman.

"He will not do it again," Murray assured him.  "Master Bones!"

Peter regretfully unhitched the noose from Bones' neck and
administered a shove which sent him reeling across the deck, to carom
into the butt of the mizzenmast, recoiling with the loss of a broken
tooth and ending up in a battered heap at Murray's feet.  My
great-uncle regarded the fellow with obvious displeasure.

"Stand up, Master Bones," he said.

Bones stumbled to his feet, bleeding from several cuts and scratches.
He was very plainly frightened at what lay ahead of him.

"Master Bones," resumed my great-uncle, "you are for the present
under my command, and I happen to have somewhat old-fashioned
theories as regards discipline and the carrying out of orders.  You
have recently disobeyed an order of mine."

"Sure, I didn't----"

"Master Bones," my uncle went on without raising his voice, "did you
ever know a man named Fotherill--Jack, I believe, was the given name?"

Bones nodded, unable to speak.

"And what did I order done to him, Master Bones?"

Bones moistened his lips.

"Keel-hauled, he was."

"Correct," agreed my great-uncle.  "Keel-hauled.  A most expressive
phrase, Robert," he added to me.  "Technically, I should explain, it
involves drawing a man under the keel of a vessel.  It has--shall we
say?--unpleasant consequences."

He turned to Bones.

"No man disobeys an order of mine more than once, Master Bones.  That
is all.  You may go for'ard."

The man started to slouch off, wiping the blood from his cheek with
his coat sleeve; but Peter stepped in front of him.

The Dutchman took an oaken belaying-pin from the rack around the
mizzenmast, held it out toward Bones and the others and calmly broke
it in two with his bare hands and tossed the fragments overside.

"Admirable!" exclaimed my great-uncle.  "What words could hope to
express so much as that gesture?  And it intrigues me to note that
Corlaer has a distinct taste for the dramatic.  I trust that you are
recovering from the seasickness, friend Peter?"

"I get well, _ja_," answered Peter.

"Then perhaps you will come below and join me at breakfast?"

Peter looked unhappy--he loved his food, did Peter.

"_Neen_," he said simply.  "If I eat, I get sick."

"You have my sympathy," replied my great-uncle with unfailing
courtesy.  "I advise a modest diet for a day or two, with an
occasional dram of liquor to warm the stomach, and then I prophesy
you will become as good a sailor as any of us.  You, Robert, I
perceive to have made yourself instantly at home upon the strange
element.  That is excellent.  You shall yet prove a credit to me.  Do
you feel sufficiently stimulated by your new experiences to partake
of a second meal so early in the day?"

"I have just been hearing what became of the lawful crew of this
vessel," I answered.  "It left me no appetite for food."

"Regrettable," he returned sadly.  "Life is a hard business, Robert,
as you have yet to learn.  Mercy is as often as not a mistaken
policy, a vice as much as a virtue.  Silver, has the lookout sighted
any vessel?"

"Not a sail since we cleared Sandy Hook, sir," the one-legged man
answered briskly.

"Very good.  Keep on this course and call me at once should a sail
show in any quarter."  And he descended with proper dignity to his
breakfast.




CHAPTER VI

TALL SHIPS AND LAWLESS MEN

There was a noticeable tightening of discipline after my
great-uncle's admonition to Bones, and Peter and I were let severely
alone, except by Silver, who, I think, found satisfaction in annoying
the mate by the effusiveness of his cordiality to us.  A second
lookout was sent into the foretop, and the watch on deck were
continually on the alert.  But nothing untoward happened that day.
The brig held on her course to the southeast, and the sea surrounded
us with the immensity of its restless waters.  One moment the land
was a faint, hazy streak in the distance; the next it was gone.

My great-uncle paced the deck with measured strides throughout the
afternoon, his head bent upon his chest, not a word for anybody.  He
ignored me as thoroughly as the members of the crew, who treated
Silver and Bones with offhand familiarity, but scurried from his path
if he came near them and were quick to bob their heads and tug at
forelocks.  When night came he supervised the hoisting of two
lanthorns, red and green, one above the other, to the main truck; and
he ate very little of the excellent meal which Silver cooked in the
galley and Darby served us in the cabin.  Nor, contrary to his usual
mood as I had read it, was he inclined for conversation.

He returned immediately to the deck, leaving Peter and me to an
exchange of casual remarks with the Irish boy before we went early to
our stateroom, full sleepy with the heavy sea-air.  Peter was almost
himself again, although he dared eat but little and suffered qualms
when the brig rolled much from the perpendicular.  He was asleep as
soon as he lay down, but I drowsed lightly for some hours, and all
that time I could hear overhead the _tap-tap-tap_ of footfalls in
even cadence as my great-uncle strode from the stern railing to the
cabin companionway and back again.

Yet when I went on deck in the morning it was to discover Murray
already there, dressed with his customary immaculate precision, his
face fresh and unfatigued.  He stood astraddle close by the wheel,
hands clasped behind him.  his gaze fixed upon the tossing waters
ahead.  The wind had backed around several points during the night,
so that we were making more difficult weather of it; and the easy,
gliding motion of the previous day had been changed to a choppy roll.

Peter was not communicative; and as I was in no mood for Silver's
hypocrisy or Darby's wild talk I strode up to my great-uncle.

"You seem perturbed," I said.

"I am," he returned frankly.  "I have two problems upon my mind."

"Unfortunately, I see no signs of pursuit," I answered.

He smiled.

"Nor will you, Nephew Robert.  No, my problems are connected with the
difficult task of attaining an imaginary spot in this trackless waste
and puzzlement as to whether I have correctly estimated an equation
of human values.  You are not, perhaps, mathematical?  Ah, too bad!
There is no mental exercise so restful and diverting to the mind as
algebra.  But figures lack the warm interest of human equations.  As,
for instance, the exact degree of trust to be imposed in
untrustworthy persons."

"Sail ho!" shouted the lookout in the main crosstrees.

Murray's calm face flushed with sudden emotion, and he took a step
forward.

"Where does she lie?" he trumpeted through his clasped hands.

"Maybe one, two points to larboard, sir."

"Can you make her out?"

"Only tops'ls, sir; big 'uns."

"Let me know as soon as you make her," said Murray, and turned back
to me.

But almost at once the other lookout in the foretop sang out--

"Second sail to larboard, sir, comin' up arter t'other chap!"

Murray rubbed his hands together with every evidence of satisfaction.

"Ah!" he exclaimed.  "It appears that my estimation of the safe
degree of trust to be imposed in the given situation was within the
bounds of accuracy."

"I don't understand you."

"No?  In plain English let us say then that my own vessel and consort
are meeting me according to plan."

"The sea is wide.  How can you be sure 'tis they?"

"I can not.  Yet the balance of probability is in my favor."

"Why do you speak of trust?" I challenged.  "Can not you trust your
own people?"

"I trust nobody farther than I must," he retorted.

And without another word he produced a patent folding spyglass from
his pocket and clapped it to his eye.  Silver, who had been an
interested witness to the scene from his aerie atop of the cabin
skylight, hopped across the deck to my great-uncle's side.

"Beggin' your pardon, captain," he said.  "But I'd make oath that
tops'l is the canvas you took out o' the Mogul's ship off
Pondicherry.  Mind it, sir?  'Twas uncommon bleached and looked
whiter'n our cloth."

Murray handed him the glass.

"Stap me, Silver, but I believe you are right," he returned.  "What a
hawk's eye you must have!  Here, see what you can make of it with
this."

Long John peered through the glass, steadying his crutch against the
butt of the mizzen.

"Aye, 'tis----"

"_R'yal James_ to leeward!" hailed the foretop.

And the main crosstrees echoed, not to be outdone--

"_Walrus_ comin' up astarn o' her!"

"'Tis they, never a doubt," assented Silver as he lowered the glass.
"Diggin' into it they are, too, and a lusty show o' canvas to both o'
them.  If you was to ask me now, captain, I'd say Flint isn't willing
to plow your wake."

If there was a hint of an indicated threat in this remark Murray
ignored it.

"Master Martin knows his ship," he answered, "as doth Captain Flint
his.  You lads are forever pondering why certain men rise to command.
There lies the answer, Silver.  'Tis knowledge of how to handle your
ship; aye, and to fight her, and to plan at need how not to fight
her."

Silver knuckled his forehead, handing back the glass.

"Sure, sir, they all says a good captain is born and never made, and
we be main fortunate as has two that can't be beat or took or harried
from their ways."

My great-uncle indulged in a pinch of snuff, a mildly cynical smile
upon his handsome features.

"I thank you," he acknowledged.  "And now I would have the men tumble
up their gear from below and make ready the boats.  I shall also
leave it to you, Silver, to lay the powder-train.  How much have you?"

"Three casks, sir."

"Excellent.  But allow us ample time to get free."

"Why do you give your orders to Silver and not to Bones?" I inquired
curiously after the one-legged man had gone for'ard.

My great-uncle lowered his glass with a benevolent smile.

"I rejoice to perceive that you have an observant tendency," he
commented.  "Why do I single out Silver for orders?  Ah!  The reasons
are quite obvious.  To begin with, he is gifted with a personality
which enables him to secure the accomplishment of tasks; but perhaps
as important as that consideration is the parallel fact that it lies
to my interest to develop the seed of dissension in the _Walrus'_
crew.  The future contains infinite possibilities.  Who knows what
trifling factor may influence the dictates of fate?"

"They must be a strange crowd aboard the _Walrus_," I said.

"They are," assented my great-uncle.  "In piracy, Robert, as in
politics and business, he wins who plays the opposing factions
against each other.  I am, you may say, in a minority of one among
some hundreds of headstrong, wilful, intemperate men.  United, they
would crush me like a fly on the wall.  Divided, and kept divided,
they are so many instruments for the fulfilling of my desires."

"How if I handed on your precept to them?" I gibed.

"They would not believe you.  Their vanity would prohibit it.  And
even though they did, I would divide them upon the very point you
raised."

The amazing ingenuity and fertility of resource of this heartless old
rogue who was my relative began to compel me to a reluctant
admiration of him.  Perhaps some trace of this was revealed in my
face, for his own eyes brightened and he dropped one hand lightly
upon my coat sleeve.

"We shall yet come to an understanding, Robert.  All is not so black
as is painted.  But my design is to induct you into the scope of my
plans at one sitting, seeing that in such a manner I can most clearly
present to you my reasons for requiring your assistance and the
importance of the stake I play for."

"I know not of the blackness," I answered; "but I require no clearer
understanding.  Here on these decks have been murder and robbery, and
in your ranks, if I mistake not, breed treachery and hate.  'Tis a
sorry outlook.  I would gladly be gone from it."

His face fell a little.

"Tut," he said.  "We disposed of that before.  Wait until we are
aboard the _Royal James_, Robert.  Then you will realize what I offer
you."

"I have heard much of it already," I agreed dryly.

"Anon you shall hear all," he answered.  "Let us get Flint
across-table from us in the _James'_ state cabin with a beaker of rum
at his elbow.  Then you shall hear me talk."

Bones came up to speak to him; and I rejoined Peter, who was glumly
watching the unlashing of the small boats and the rigging of the
falls by which they were slung overside.

"Now I get more sick again," he grunted.

"Cheer up," I told him.  "You shall soon have a more substantial
craft beneath you."

And I pointed to the two strange ships which had risen over the
horizon line until the towering piles of their bellying sails were
clearly visible.  Like us, they rather quartered the wind; but they
were of far heavier build, and they seemed to crash through seas that
we were tossed over.  While we watched, their upper works came into
view, and I descried a long band of painted gunports on the leader's
starboard side.

"She's a thirty-six, no less!" I exclaimed.  "Can she be Murray's
ship?"

"Whatefer she is, I be sick," rejoined Peter unhappily.

John Silver stumped up to where we leaned upon the larboard bulwarks.

"Sightly, ain't they?" he said.  "Nothin' like a fine ship wi' canvas
drawin' for a picture, is there?"

His face shone with what, I am persuaded, was entirely honest emotion.

"They are big as frigates," I answered.  "How did your company come
by such craft?"

He chuckled.

"I ha' heard tell the captain had the _James_ from the Frenchies in
some funny way.  A Injyman she was--the _Esperance_.  But Flint and a
few o' us took the _Walrus_ with our own hands on the Smyrna v'yage.
She's better nor she was then, but she can't sail wi' the _James_
yet."

"Is she as heavy armed as the _James_?" I asked, for the leading ship
partly blanketed her from our view.

"Pierced the same, she is, Master Ormerod, and both has
eighteen-pounder carronades below, but where the _Walrus_ carries
long twelves on the main deck, the _James_ has long eighteens."

As Murray nodded dismissal to Bones, Silver left us and hopped up to
him.

"All set and ready below, captain," he announced.

My great-uncle cast his eye at the approaching ships, now so near
that we could make out quite distinctly the contour of their hulls,
painted yellow, with a white band delimiting the ports, man-o'-war
fashion.  The _James_ was already beginning to take in some of her
top canvas.

"Very good, Silver," he answered.  "Master Bones!  You will bring the
ship to and put over the boats."

There was a great flapping and banging as the brig rounded to, and
with much yo-ho-hoing the boats were lowered into the water.

"You will go off first, Master Bones," ordered Murray.  "Kindly
present my compliments to Captain Flint and say that I should like to
have a word with him aboard the _James_ at his early convenience."

Bones sullenly touched his cap and led better than half the crew into
one of the two longboats the brig had carried.  Murray nodded to
Silver as they cast off.

"Start your train," he said shortly.  "Nephew Robert, I wish you and
Peter to go into the second boat.  At once, please!"

"Plenty o' time, captain," said Silver with a grin.  "You can lay to
it I'm a-goin' to give myself a chance to hop up from below."

The suspicion of a smile dawned in my great-uncle's eyes.

"It is barely possible that your disability is a factor in my
arrangements," he answered.

Peter and I climbed clumsily down the ladder of cleats nailed to the
brig's hull and dropped into the bobbing longboat.  Peter groaned as
we crawled over the thwarts.

"Like der waves is my stomach--oop--andt down.  Now I be sick, _ja_!"

And he was.

Presently Murray descended the brig's side with an agility which put
me to shame and took his seat in the stern sheets.  Darby swarmed
down like a monkey and ensconced himself beside us in the bow.
Silver was slung over in the bight of a rope, and the last of the
crew tumbled after him, one upon the other's heels.  Oars were thrust
out, and we pulled rapidly toward the _Royal James_, wallowing in the
trough of the sea, a quarter-mile away.  The _Walrus_, foaming up
under a cloud of canvas, was almost as near, and on our weather board.

Darby crouched at my knees, drinking in the spectacle.

"Oh, the tall ships, Master Bob!  Look to the water dripping from
their bows, and the lordly way they stand up like the towers of
churches or maybe a castle.  Did ye ever see the beat of it?  And the
guns that are like to the grinning teeth in an ogre's head!"

_Boom_!  The roar of an explosion behind us was as sharp as the smack
of an open hand.  I turned my head.  So did the others.  Murray was
looking back, too, and the rowers rested on their oars.

A cloud of smoke jetted up from the brig's hatches.  She heeled over
to starboard as we watched, gave a quivering lurch and commenced to
slide under by the head.  We could hear the slap of the sails as they
struck the waves.  In two minutes she was gone.

"That was well-contrived, Silver," remarked my great-uncle.
"'Sdeath, but you are a man of parts.  Give way, lads!"

He nodded the length of the boat to me.

"I trust you perceive the significance of that, Nephew Robert.  A
certain young man, we will say, disappears from New York.  A certain
brig disappears simultaneously.  Some might go so far as to associate
the two disappearances.  Frigates put to sea in search of a certain
brig--but the brig is no more."

The men at the oars laughed loudly, and I made no answer.  What could
I say?  I felt very hopeless.

The bulwarks of the _James_ were lined with heads and faces as we
pulled under her counter and made fast, and even at that distance the
complexity of her crew was apparent.  I saw Portuguese, Finns,
Scandinavians, French and English cheek by jowl with negroes, Moors,
Indians and slant-eyed yellow men.  But what impressed me most was
the absolute silence which greeted us, a silence all the more
impressive because the wind carried to our ears the bedlam of shouts,
cheers, oaths and imprecations with which the _Walrus_ was receiving
Bones' boat several hundred yards away.

Murray waved me to the ladder as he set foot on the first cleat.

"Up with you, Nephew!  Peter, also.  The rest go to the _Walrus_."

Darby snatched at my hand as I rose.

"Whirra, whirra, but there's an ache in my heart to be parted from
ye, Master Bob!" he cried.  "And if we was to be pirates it do seem
we might be together on the same ship!"

He made to follow me, indeed, but Silver pulled him back.

"You stays wi' us, Darby," growled the one-legged man.  "Blast ye,
lad, you're our good luck.  Flint'll douse the ship in rum after one
look at ye."

"We'll meet again, Darby," I said.  "Never you fear."

He dashed the tears from his eyes.

"Sure, there's never a fear in me heart," he denied.  "But I'm all
broke up from the parting with ye.  God be good to us, and the
blessed saints spread their wings over your head!  I'm thinking
you're like to need it more than me.  Yes, yes, John, I'll be
settin'; but----"

He was still jabbering in a mixture of grief and joy when I climbed
over the bulwarks and dropped beside my great-uncle into the midst of
another world.

Fore and aft from poop to fo'csle stretched the wide deck from which
the lofty spars rose like forest giants.  The massive bulwarks were
shoulder-high, and inboard everything was painted red exactly as in a
King's ship.  The deck was remarkably clean and in order, ropes
coiled, spare spars stowed and lashed, boats in their chocks, crates
and other gear secured.  A few cannon were lashed to their ringbolts,
but the greater part of the battery was mounted on the lower deck
under cover.  The hundreds of men who had watched us from the
bulwarks had all sifted for'ard.  We stood in the midst of an open
space, with only three others.

One of these three was a very small old man with wispy gray hair and
deeply bronzed face, from which his eyes peered intensely blue and
childishly simple.  He had gold rings in his ears, and his dress was
neat and plain.

"My sarvice, captain," he greeted Murray.  "Ship's in order, I hope.
---- my eyes if we've had so much as a ---- o' genuine wind since the
---- hussy bore away from ye off the Hook."

The effect of the unspeakable blasphemies which poured with mild
intonation from his lips was ridiculous, but nobody appeared to
notice it, and I learned afterward that his habit of swearing by the
anatomy of the twelve apostles and various saints and sacred figures
was the quaintest of several quaint characteristics of an unusual
personality.

"We won't complain about that, Master Martin," replied my
great-uncle.  "I have brought back my grandnephew to be the mainstay
of my old age.  Here he is--Master Ormerod, Martin.  Ah, and this is
a friend of his and an old enemy of mine, Peter Corlaer," as Peter
rolled over the top of the bulwarks.  "He is more to be reckoned with
than you might suppose, is Peter.

"Master Martin, Nephew Robert, is my mate, and as such, my right hand
and arm."

Martin stepped back, and the second of the three men confronting us
touched his cap.  This was a square, heavy-built fellow with a dour
glint to his eye, who wore a decent blue cloth coat and small clothes.

"And here is Saunders, Master Martin's second," continued my
great-uncle.  "A Scot like myself.  My nephew should make a fine
Scotsman; eh, Saunders?"

"He's a braw-lookin' laddie in seemin'," Saunders agreed cautiously.

"Your meaning is that we must prove him?" responded Murray.  "Quite
true.  We shall.  Hola, Coupeau!"

And he rattled into a string of French which I could not follow as
the third man met him with a bow and a scrape of one foot.  Coupeau
was as brutal in looks and manner as Black Dog or Bill Bones, but
without the sinister implications of speech and action that made me
shudder whenever the blind man Pew approached me or spoke in my
hearing.  He had been branded on the cheek, and an attempt to
obliterate the brand--or perhaps 'twas the superimposed scar of a
wound--had made that side of his face a very nightmare.  His wrists
and forearms showed gouges that wound upward like snakes and
suggested what other torments his gaudy clothing concealed.

"Coupeau," remarked my great-uncle, turning again to me, "is our
gunner.  I saved him from the French galleys, and he is not without
devotion to me, that quality of devotion tinged by self-interest
which is to be preferred above all.

"And now we will go aft and prepare to receive Captain Flint.  Master
Martin, we shall probably lie here for several hours.  Have all the
tops manned and a vigilant watch maintained.  I have every reason to
suppose we need fear no intruders, but we must be on the edge of the
cruising-course of the King's ships, and I'll take no risks."

"Aye, aye, sir," assented Martin.  "We ha' not sighted a sail this
twenty-four hours gone."

"And before?"

"A Philadelphia packet.  Captain Flint made signal to chase; but I
held off as you directed, and he turned back."

"You did well, Martin.  I'll not forget.  Conduct Captain Flint to us
when he comes aboard."




CHAPTER VII

MURRAY'S PLAN

Murray led us to a door in the break of the poop which was opened for
us by a stalwart black in a red livery coat, who ushered us along a
companionway lined with stateroom doors into a spacious state cabin
stretching the width of the stern.  The walls were paneled in
mahogany; silver sconces were fastened at intervals, and a wondrous
luster chandelier was pendant from the ceiling, itself uncommonly
lofty for shipboard; several paintings in the French school hung at
the sides; and there were trophies of peculiar arms and armor.
Underfoot were Eastern rugs, thick-piled and soft of hue.  The
furniture was of mahogany, and a service of massy plate appeared upon
the table that was set under the range of windows which formed the
rear wall of the room.

My great-uncle surveyed this magnificence with pardonable pride.
'Twas evident it meant something to him.

"Diomede," he said to the negro, "where is Master Gunn?"

A high, piping voice answered him from the companionway.

"Coming, worshipful sir.  Ben Gunn's a-coming.  I jest stopped by the
galley to fetch up your chocolate, a-sayin' to myself as the captain
would be sharp-set account o' early business in the morning."

The man who followed the voice trotted in bearing a silver pitcher of
steaming chocolate, Murray's favorite drink; aye, and food.  He was a
slender fellow, with a simple, open face, clad in plain black as
became an upper servant.  He stopped dead at sight of us.

"Set your tray on the table, Gunn," instructed my great-uncle.  "This
is my grandnephew, Master Ormerod, and his friend, Master Corlaer.
They are to sail with us a while."

Gunn pulled his forelock and ducked.

"Sarvant, gentlemen," he acknowledged.  "Allus glad to please, is Ben
Gunn.  Bound to oblige ye, gentlemen.  You jest name your drinks, and
I'll fetch 'em up from the wine-bins."

"Food as well, Gunn," said Murray.  "And Captain Flint is coming
aboard."

Ben Gunn cocked his head on one side.

"That means rum," he commented.  "Plenty o' rum, says you.  Jest
leave it to Ben, captain."

He ducked and scraped again and skipped off into the companionway
with a kind of wiggle like a self-conscious child.

"My steward," remarked my relative.  "He will be at your disposal for
anything you require, Robert--yours, too, friend Peter.  You will
find the negroes equally anxious to please."

"The man is a half-wit, is he not?" I asked.

"A natural, yes," assented Murray, tasting the chocolate.

"I should think it would be dangerous to have one so simple in such
close proximity to you."

My great-uncle smiled.

"You are quite, quite wrong, my boy.  It is for the very reason that
the man is incapable of spying that I use him.  He is more valuable
for my purposes than the most intelligent member of the crew."

He broke off.

"This chocolate is by no means so well brewed as Silver's.  An
extraordinary fellow, that, monstrously clever--exactly the sort of
man, Robert, I never permit to remain near me.  Indeed, if you
possess the patience and the interest to analyze the composition of
my officers and crew you will observe, I believe, that there is not
an independently clever man amongst them.  Aye, and if you find me a
clever man aboard the _Royal James_--yourself and friend Peter
excepted, of course--I will thank you to point him out to me, and I
will straightway make a present of him to Flint, who must have half a
dozen of the _Walrus'_ crew who esteem themselves equally capable
with him of commanding her."

"Yet the _James_ was able to get along without you for several days,"
I remarked.

"Ah!  A shrewd thrust!  I am bound to admit, my dear Robert, that I
regarded my recently concluded expedition as a dubious experiment.
'Twas in the light of reflections identical with those you have just
detailed that I spoke of it as a problem in human equations.  I was
reasonably convinced that I could depend upon my men, but I should
not have been greatly surprized had they abandoned me.

"I am not--by necessity I am not--regarded with affection by my
followers.  And on the whole, I think, I have gotten along better by
means of fear than I might have by means of affection.  Fear is a
natural element in a pirate's career.  What place has he in his life
for affections?

"But we are faring far afield, Robert, into realms of philosophy in
no way affiliated with our problems of the immediate moment.  Hark!
Do I not hear something?"

He did beyond question--an uproar of curses and shouts upon the deck
outside.

"Perhaps your crew have decided to spring their revolt after your
return, instead of during your absence," I suggested.

He shook his head, smiling.

"No, no.  It is only that Captain Flint has come aboard.  Pray take
your seats.  I promise you an interesting episode."

The door to the deck banged open, and a harsh, domineering voice
bellowed in the companionway.

"---- me, Martin, what the ---- ---- ---- ---- d'ye think ye are?  By
the ---- ---- ---- ----, ye lousy, slack-bellied swab, ye made us----"

"Stow that, ye ---- ---- ---- apology for a ---- ---- ---- ----,"
interrupted Martin mildly from the deck.  "Why, any ---- ---- would
ha' had more sense than you!"

"Like ----!  I'm my own master, I am.  I----"

"Ye may be when ye stand on the _Walrus'_ deck, but here you're only
another ---- as doesn't know better'n to veer after----"

"Belay for a ---- ---- lackey, ye slab-faced chunk o' rotted
sea-horse!  I'll talk to your master!"

Slam went the door, and a mutter of curses rumbled from the
companionway, preceding a tall, blue-jowled man in a flaming red coat
all cobwebbed over with gold lace.  He halted in the cabin entrance,
hands on his hips, feet planted wide, close-set green eyes flickering
balefully on either side of a long nose that seemed to poke out from
a tangle of lank, black hair.

"Back, eh, Murray?" he snarled.  "Two men the richer for your effort.
Gut me, 'twas a fool's errand!"

"Pardon me," objected Murray, "but I am considerably more than 'two
men the richer' in consequence of my run ashore--although I would not
appear by these words to deprecate the importance to be attached to
the acquisition of my grandnephew and Master Corlaer.  Permit me,
Captain Flint!  Master Ormerod, my grandnephew, and Peter Corlaer."

And to me, aside:

"I fear these introductions must become boring.  We shall require no
more."

Flint scowled at us, flinging himself into a chair at the opposite
end of the table from my great-uncle.

"A youth and a fat man!" he ejaculated.  "And unwilling at that, so
Bones tells me."

"Master Bones was correct in that statement," my great-uncle assented
cheerfully; "but I fancy he neglected to add that the 'fat man' took
his knife away from him and must have hanged him had I not
intervened."

An appreciable degree of respect dawned in Flint's eyes.

"He is no butter-tub if he bested Bill," conceded the _Walrus'_
captain.  "Curse me, though, if I see why you should add a cub to
your crew."

"Tut, tut, captain," remonstrated Murray.  "'A cub!' Think again.
The boy is my heir."

"All he'll fall heir to will be the rope that hung you," returned
Flint.  "But I'll own I did you wrong when I accused you of being but
two men the better by your shore expedition.  I was forgetting the
red-headed mascot John Silver fetched aboard.  'Tis the first promise
o' luck we ha' had!  I'd never have lost that Philadelphia packet t'
other day with him aboard."

"I believe I overheard something of a dispute with Martin on that
point," commented my great-uncle dryly.  "He obeyed my orders in
calling you off, and you broke our agreement when you would have
given chase."

"And why not?" roared Flint.  "A ---- ---- fool agreement, if you
broach it now!  A ---- ---- of a ---- ---- piece of ---- ---- ----
idiocy!  Curse me for a lubber if I see the sense in letting a fat
prize slip through our fingers.  And so I told Martin.  Let me have
him on my deck, and I'd use my hanger to him."

My uncle took snuff with much delicacy and rang a silver bell in
front of him.

"Gunn is late with the liquor.  I must ask your indulgence, captain,
for compelling you to talk dry.  But as to Martin and the prize.
Indeed, you wrong the good fellow.  As I have already said, he did no
more than carry out my orders, and while you may experience
difficulty in comprehending my reasons for stipulating that no prizes
were to be taken in my absence, I am so vain as to suppose that a few
moments' conversation will clear all doubts from your mind."

Ben Gunn bustled into the cabin in the course of this harangue and
deposited a trayful of decanters, bottles and flasks before us.
Captain Flint, without awaiting an invitation, seized upon an earthen
receptacle labeled "Gedney's Jamaican Rum," pried out the cork with
the point of a knife, tilted it to his mouth and drained a mighty
dram.  Then he set it down beside him, wiped his mouth on his
coat-cuff and cleared his throat.

"Humph," he growled.  "I'm listening."

My uncle looked distressed.

"Gunn," he said, "how often have I asked you to supply Captain Flint
with a goblet, beaker or some other drinking-utensil?"

The steward wiggled abjectly and pulled his forelock.

"Oft and often you has, captain, but 'taint no manner o'
use--leastways not the fust time.  Captain Flint says as how he
always has to take the flavor of a new flask straight from the neck."

"And so I do," agreed Flint.  "Rum don't taste the same in a cup.  Ye
drink coffee or tea in a cup--but rum! ---- my eyes if I ever see so
much fuss over drink and victuals as you make.  But anything to
oblige, Murray.  I don't ha' to eat with ye every day, thank God!"

Gunn produced a large silver goblet from a wall-cupboard, and Flint
straightway filled it to the brim.  I pushed a cut-glass carafe of
water toward him, supposing he would wish some dilution, and he
laughed jarringly.

"You ha' much to learn, my lad," he jeered.  "We don't spoil good rum
wi' water aboard the _Walrus_.  There's a cask broached this minute
on the spar-deck, and all hands fillin' their pannikins as fast as
they can empty 'em, wi' red-headed Darby astride the butt for luck."

"Which means you will be in no condition to make sail a few hours
hence," deplored my great-uncle, wagging his head.  "'Tis
foolishness, Flint.  This rum-swigging will yet prove the undoing of
you and every man of your crew.  I am no upholder of imaginary
virtues, as you know, but unbridled indulgence must ultimately defeat
its own ends."

"Look to your ship, and I'll look to mine," snapped Flint, quaffing a
wineglassful of the goblet's contents.

My uncle stared him straight in the eye with a hard, direct thrust of
power which stirred my unwilling admiration.

"To whom do you owe your present position?" he asked coldly.

Flint made a patent attempt to stare him down, but abandoned the
effort and looked away.

"Some might say one thing and some another," he muttered.

"To whom do you owe your present position, Flint?" repeated Murray.

"Oh, to you, most like," admitted Flint.  "Blast you!"

"Have I ever led you into difficulties?" continued my great-uncle.

"Not if----"

"Have I ever led you into difficulties?"

"No."

"Have we failed in any important venture since our association began?"

"Not yet," admitted Flint sourly.

"Very well.  Now I ask you: When I promise a certain accomplishment
am I to be relied upon?"

"You ha' a head on your shoulders," conceded Flint.

"And you have not," amended Murray.  "No, do not say any more.  You
are an excellent man to handle your ship, Flint, and as fearless as
any of our ruffians; but you are no more capable of looking ahead a
week or two than Ben Gunn."

"I take much from ye, Murray," snarled Flint, half-rising; "but think
not ye can humble me before----"

"Sit down," ordered Murray.  "You'll take what you deserve, which in
this instance is a plain statement that you would ha' made a fool of
yourself by chasing the Philadelphia packet.  I doubt if you could
have taken her, for your bottom is foul; but if you had, her loss
must have aroused comment, and with New York already apprised that we
are in these seas we should ha' had every frigate on the North
American and West Indian stations a-hunting us.  And what then?"

"We could lie up safe enough at the Rendeyvoo."

"Spyglass Island?  I dare say--although some day 'twill be blundered
upon, if not discovered.  But I ask you to recall that we take no
prizes when we hole up.  'Tis a losing game."

"Well, what would you?" Flint flung at him with an air of defiance,
which Murray ignored.

"I would make the greatest coup we have attempted."

Flint laughed disagreeably.

"So you said when you arranged to go into New York, but you have
carried back no treasure with you."

My uncle regarded him with what, under other circumstances, I should
describe as honest indignation.

"You fool!" he said with a rasp in his voice--and I did not wonder
that Flint pulled sidewise in his chair as if to avoid a stab.  "Did
you think I was to go into that huddle of a town, with its wealth in
furs and groceries, and fetch out a treasure?"

"What, then?" demanded Flint, moistening his lips.

My uncle leaned forward across the table, lips drawn tight over his
teeth.  His eyes shot sparks.

"Knowledge, fool!  Intelligence!  That which wise men labor a
lifetime to secure and the ignorant pass by in the gutter."

"It may be knowledge to you," protested Flint childishly; "but how'm
I to know of it as never heard it?"

Murray rose from the table and commenced to stroll the length of the
cabin, hands clasped under the skirts of his coat.  And as he
strolled he talked.  Flint followed his every move uneasily, with
occasional drafts of rum.  Peter and I watched the two of them,
fascinated by this conflict of wills, which was to exert a vital
influence upon our lives--yes, and upon those of hundreds of others.

"I must speak in simple terms, I perceive, Flint," began my
great-uncle.

The passion was out of his voice, and the sentences trickled from his
lips slowly, with an air of detachment.

"And that I may speak simply and present adequately an important
subject, I must ask you to indulge me at length."

Flint nodded sullenly, seeing that an answer was required.

"We have frequently discussed the possibility of taking one of the
Spanish treasure-ships," continued Murray.  "But we have never
attempted the project because we could not discover the date of
sailing or the port wherein the treasure was embarked.  It hath been
the custom of the Spaniards in recent years--in fact, since the
depredations of Morgan and his brethren--to shift arbitrarily the
port of embarkation from year to year, as likewise to change the date
of sailing.  One year the port would be Cartagena, the next Chagres,
the next Porto Bello, the next even Vera Cruz.  They have been known
to ship the year's produce of the mines around Cape Horn.  And
similarly the treasure ships, which used formerly to sail invariably
in the Fall of the year, now depart whenever it pleases the fancy of
the Council of the Indies to fix a date."

He paused, and Flint rasped----

"So much is known to all of us."

"I conceded as much," answered Murray smoothly.  "What follows you do
not know.  When we returned from Madagascar----"

"'Twas against my advice," growled Flint.  "Ye play too much wi'
politics."

"With politics!  Exactly," agreed my great-uncle.  "Well, perhaps I
do.  'Tis true that so far I have obtained trifling advantage from
the sport, excluding one substantial fortune, this vessel we are in
and the information which makes it possible for me to take this
year's treasure-ship."

Flint sat erect.  I caught my breath.  Peter, too, showed a gleam of
excitement in his little eyes that twinkled from behind the ramparts
of flesh that masked his solemn face.

"---- me, Murray!" swore Flint.  "Do you say that in sober earnest?"

"I do.  Do you remember that we cruised off the Spanish coast last
Spring and Fall, and that two months since I sent a periague into the
Havana?  During our Spanish cruises I established connections with a
group of Jacobite gentlemen who know me and placed before them the
outline of a plan, the acceptance of which they communicated to me in
dispatches the periague fetched to Spyglass Island.  In those
dispatches I was notified to meet my principal confederate in New
York on a certain date.  I met him.  The necessary arrangements were
consummated, and it simply remains for us to execute the plan."

Flint clutched at his beaker of rum and emptied it shakily into his
throat.

"How--how much?" he quavered.

"One million five hundred thousand pounds."

There was a moment of silence.  The clean, golden sunlight flooded
through the stern windows and dappled the polished surface of the
table with darting molts and beams.  Flint's jaw dropped on his
chest.  His green eyes glared.  Peter and I were as dazed as himself.
Only my great-uncle remained calm, pacing quietly up and down the
carpeted deck, eyes fixed upon some vision of the future.

"All--that?" stammered Flint.  "'Sdeath!  'T would be the greatest
haul in our time, Murray.

"It is ours," affirmed Murray.  "Upon terms."

"Terms?" echoed Flint.  "What terms?  Who can compel us to terms?"

My great-uncle came to a stop in front of him.

"My terms, let us say," he answered.

"Oh, aye," mumbled Flint.  "But if 'tis there for the taking----"

"It will be there for the taking, as you put it, upon the terms I lay
down," stated my great-uncle.

"But if ye know of yourself where it can be taken why must we bother
wi' terms, Murray?" clamored Flint.  "What's riches for us can be
pared down to short cuts if it must be shared out right and left."

My great-uncle's laughter was wholly contemptuous.

"Observe, Robert," he appealed to me, "here was a man, who, a
half-hour past, knew naught of this treasure we are discussing.  It
meant nothing to him.  He never dreamed of obtaining it.  And now
that he has held out to him the possibility of looting a measure of
it he waxes indignant lest that measure be too small!"

Flint refilled the beaker with rum.

The stuff seemed to heighten the uncanny blue pallor of his face, and
the pupils of his eyes dwindled to pin-pricks, whether from the
strong drink or excitement I can not say.  But his manner was
steadier than it had been.

"Why not?" he flared in reply to my relative's mockery.  "If we take
it, why not take all?"

"Because," retorted Murray with a burst of terrible energy, "I have
passed my word as to the terms upon which the treasure is to be
taken."

"What's your word?" rapped Flint.

For a moment I thought my great-uncle would strike him.  He made to
draw back his arm, and perspiration stood out in white beads upon his
forehead.  Flint feared it, too, but did not raise a hand to protect
himself, charmed to immobility by the virulence of the basilisk's
stare which Murray directed at him.

"It is my word," said Murray finally in a very soft voice.  "No more,
Flint.  A poor thing, as the poet hath said, yet my own!  Also--that
I may chime in harmony with your mental processes--it happens that my
personal interests are bound up with the observance of these terms."

"I thought so," sneered Flint.

"Ah!  Did you?"

My great-uncle's tones continued dulcet.

"It is a matter we will not discuss further, since it is beyond the
range of your comprehension.  I shall merely say that the terms are
fixed, and that you will either accept or reject them."

"What are they?"

"As to division of the spoils?  One hundred thousand pounds to myself
as author and architect of the plan; seven hundred thousand to our
two ships; and seven hundred thousand to my friends who coöperated
with me to make it possible."

Flint brought his fist crashing down upon the table.

"I'll be ---- if I accept!" he shouted.  "What?  Less than half to
our company?  And you sneaking off with a cool hundred thousand
pounds in your pockets, and your friends, as like as not, splitting
secretly with you!"

My great-uncle refreshed himself with snuff, contriving to invest the
ceremony with an effect of distaste which I found amusing.

"Stap me, but you have a low mind!" he drawled.  "Allow me to direct
your attention to the fact that the plan amounts to my friends and I
undertaking voluntarily to present you an opportunity to participate
in the division of seven hundred thousand pounds, for which you will
be called upon to do nothing except agree to follow out several
stipulations I shall lay down."

"Let's hear 'em."

My great-uncle ticked off the items upon his finger-tips.

"First, 'tis highly desirable that we should lie low during the
ensuing months.  Activities such as we usually conduct would tend to
affright the Council of the Indies and bring about a change in plan
for the treasure-ship's sailing."

"What shall we do, then?"

"My counsel is to bear up for Spyglass Island and careen there.  Both
ships are foul, and 'twill prove an excellent opportunity to make all
clean and right."

Flint nodded.

"We shall need our speed against the Spaniard," he commented.

"_I_ shall," returned my great-uncle with some emphasis.  "This
brings me to my second point.  'Tis advisable that we do not cruise
in company for the treasure.  I aim to intercept the _Santissima
Trinidad_ before she passes from the Caribbean into the Atlantic, and
to that end I shall hover on a particular meridian awaiting secret
intelligence notifying me when she puts forth from her port."

The blue look became intensified in Flint's face.

"You'd leave the _Walrus_ behind?" he demanded.

"I must.  Figure it for yourself," argued my relative.  "Two tall
ships plying the narrow seas, within easy sail of Jamaica and the
Havana and Martinico!  We should have the frigates after us in no
time.  My plan is to masquerade as a King's ship, running from any
ugly customers who show themselves."

"Aye," said Flint.  "And after you'd taken the treasure and stowed it
all below hatches what thought would you give to us aboard the
_Walrus_, eh?  You'd be up and off, and we might whistle for our
share."

"You wrong me, Captain Flint," replied my great-uncle simply.

But Flint gave an ugly laugh.  It might be the rum or the stimulus of
the debate or a gradual access of self-reliance; but he was no longer
to be cowed by moral suasion.  If I had doubted this, the suave
diplomacy with which my great-uncle proceeded to treat him must have
convinced me to the contrary.

"If I wrong you, Murray, 'twould be the first time without valid
cause," Flint rejoined.  "Come, come!  You must think of me better
than that."

"I have thought of the best terms possible," answered Murray.  "Mark
me, 'twould be perfectly feasible for me to give you the slip any
dark night, take the _Santissima Trinidad_ by my lone and never
account to you for a doubloon.  I do not for two reasons: First, I
have a feeling of common loyalty to you and your men; we have worked
and fought together in the past, and I would give them their share in
this haul.  Second, I wish to use the Rendezvous in connection with
the coup, and if you choose to look at it so, you can set down your
inclusion as payment for that, as well as for your sacrificing
chances at other prizes by keeping under cover."

"It won't wash," denied Flint.  "What you say sounds well enough.  It
may be true.  But I couldn't go back and report it to a fo'csle
counsel on the _Walrus_ and expect to have it believed.  I have to
blink myself when I think of it.  ----!" He grinned evilly.  "I know
what I'd do in your shoes."

My great-uncle regarded him speculatively.

"What, then, is your answer?" Murray inquired.

"I don't play on those terms," returned Flint with decision.  "Let me
cruise with you, have a share in taking the prize, and I'll talk
differently."

Murray shook his head.

"'Twould ruin the plan.  I know you, Flint.  'Tis not in you to
cruise for days and forego fat merchants that cross your bows, ripe
to be plucked.  The Philadelphia packet you were fuming over when you
came in here is a case in point!  Man, there'd be a dozen such
chances while we awaited the Spaniard, and one of them you'd go for.
No, I can't risk it.  Alone, I can contrive not to attract attention.
In company, we should stir up a hornet's nest."

"Curse me for a canting mugger, then, if I'll trade on it," snarled
Flint.  "I'll not trust you, Murray, and that's flat."

"Suppose that I gave you a hostage?" suggested my great-uncle
tentatively.

"Hostage?  Who could ye give me for hostage whose life would mean
aught to you?  No, no!  Martin or any man you'd see with his throat
cut, and never bat an eye."

My esteemed relative's shrug was as complete a repudiation of such a
charge as might be desired.  I enjoyed it with mixed feelings because
I was beginning to see the writing on the wall.

"I had not Martin in mind," he replied now; "but one whose life means
to me more than my own."

"The man does not live," Flint swore roundly.

"He sits across the table," returned Murray.  "My grandnephew and
heir.  I will go so far as to assert that the only reason I concern
myself with this exploit is that I may secure estate and preferment
for him."

Flint eyed him shrewdly, looked from him to me and from me to him.

"Your grandnephew, you say?  Humph!  Long John says you're choice o'
him.  Still--  No, I like not your terms, Murray.  They offer too
little."

"They are the best I can offer," answered Murray definitely.  "I will
add, that there may be no misunderstandings, Flint, that the odd
seven hundred thousand pounds goes to promote the interest of a
cause, and not to line the pockets of Spanish officials, as you may
suspect; and it is highly probable that considerable of my share will
follow it."

The captain of the _Walrus_ wiped a rumspot from the table and tipped
the earthen flask bottom up above his beaker.

"'Tis a heavy commission to pay," he said.  "Eight hundred thousand
pounds out of a million and a half."

"That or nothing," declared Murray.

"And I must lose how many months' cruising the while you wait for the
treasure-ship?"

"Six or more."

"Gut me, but ye bargain like a Jew, Murray!"

"And like a Jew I pay well and surely, offering good security."

"I see it not," fended Flint, and drained the last of his rum.

"I pay seven hundred thousand pounds, to be divided share and share
by the two ships' companies, and your company will incur no risk to
win it."

Flint rose and settled his belt.

"I accept, for that I can do no better," he said.  "But I must have
the hostage.  He's the weak point of it all; but I must take some
chance, and curse me if seven hundred thousand pounds be not worth
the gamble."

He snapped his finger toward me.

"Come on, my lad.  We'll show you the life of real gentlemen
adventurers aboard the _Walrus_."

"I'm no negro man to be bargained over and passed from owner to
owner!" I exclaimed hotly.  "You can make me go, but I'll not step
willingly."

Flint was about to answer with a spurt of oaths when Murray
interrupted.

"You anticipate matters," he rebuked his associate.  "There is no
occasion for a hostage yet.  We shall sail at once for the
Rendezvous.  It will be weeks, aye, months, before I am in shape to
sail west under Hispaniola.  Time enough then to talk of delivering
your hostage."

For an instant Flint appeared to be about to object to this view, but
he evidently decided it was not worth another dispute.

"Let it go," he assented gruffly.  "We'll settle the details at the
island.  ---- me--" this with a sudden revival of friendliness--"I
knew we had not picked up that red-headed lad for nothing!  'Tis a
sure sign o' luck."

And out he swaggered from the cabin, stamping and banging the door
and sprinkling curses freely as he gained the deck and shouted for
his boat's crew to row him back to the _Walrus_.




CHAPTER VIII

A WICKED OLD MAN'S DREAM

My great-uncle sank into his chair with a gesture of disgust and
poured three fingers of brandy into a wine-glass.

"Phaugh!" he exclaimed.  "At times I am nauseated by the company
perforce I keep."

He rang the silver bell.

"Gunn," he said as the steward sidled in, "we are awaiting the food I
ordered.  But stay!  Open a window before you go.  This place reeks
with the stench of decayed honor."

I laughed, and he put the glass from his lips, peering at me across
its rim as if surprized.

"You find occasion for mirth in my remark, Robert?"

"I find myself in extraordinary agreement with you for the nonce," I
returned.  "You are correct.  This place doth reek of 'decayed
honor.'"

"Ah!"

He finished his drink, wiped his mouth carefully and set down the
glass.

"You are, I suspect, attempting sarcasm," he continued.  "'Tis a
diversion frequently favored by the young."

"No," I said; "I am only expressing to you my feeling that you have
as little claim to possession of a sense of honor as the man who was
just here."

Gunn unbolted one of the stern windows, and a fine breath of salty
air was blown in our faces.  Murray inhaled it deeply, and Peter,
whose face had become leaden in the cabin's close atmosphere,
regained a touch of color and edged forward in his seat.  My
great-uncle turned to him courteously, ignoring me for the moment.

"I fear you have been suffering from my thoughtlessness, friend
Peter.  Let me recommend a draft of this aqua vitae.  'Tis excellent
for settling the stomach."

"_Ja_," nodded Peter.

"We shall presently have a chicken broiled over a slow fire," pursued
Murray.  "A few slices of the breast should be easy for your
digestion and assist in the filling of the void which our rough fare
on the brig was unable to satisfy.

"But Robert and I were discussing a question of honor.  Pardon me if
I return to it."

His large face, with its powerful, craggy features, glowed with the
radiance of an intense personal conviction.

"What is honor?  Or dishonor?  Certes, here we have a call for close
reasoning.  No hasty generalities can dismiss so vexed a problem,
which hath consumed the attention of gentlemen since gentility's
institution."

"I should call it dishonorable to assure your grandnephew that you
had kidnaped him for desire of his aid and to make his fortune, when
actually you intended only to employ him as a hostage to further your
personal schemes," I said deliberately.

And if I spoke restrainedly 'twas by no mean effort, for inwardly I
seethed with resentment.

"The situation is susceptible to the interpretation which you place
upon it," he admitted evenly.  "Yet a reasonable temperament must
concede 'twas necessary for me to place the consummation of my
project before the claims of kinship.  And though you appear not to
be disposed to accept my assertions for fact, I will say once and for
all that my intentions toward you are benevolent and
affectionate--and this despite the contumely you have heaped upon me
with no regard for the disparity of our ages."

I was nonplussed, but dissatisfied.

"If that were my only count against your honor--if, indeed, a pirate
can have honor----"

"And why not?" says he sharply.  "I conceive of honor as the quality
of being faithful to oneself, to the ethical standard one has
established for this life we pass through so precariously."

"So that if a man practices dishonesty toward all save himself he
preserves his honor!" I protested.

"Now do you twist my thoughts," replied my great-uncle.  "And in the
same breath you raise a complementary question: What is
dishonesty--or honesty?  As I have told you before, I take from those
who have much, those who prey upon others.  I am no more dishonest
than that William of Normandy, who seized upon England and farmed it
out to his barons in payment for their assistance."

"You are clever with words," I sneered; "but I'll not be fooled.
What have you to say of your craft in deluding O'Donnell into risking
his daughter aboard this treasure-ship?  Do you call it honorable to
persuade a foolish unbalanced fellow to take an innocent young girl
out of a convent, carry her half across the world, and then, to cloak
a miserable conspiracy, plunge her into the society of such
scoundrels as Flint and yourself?"

Instead of losing his temper, as I had expected, my great-uncle
stared at me very earnestly throughout this tongue-lashing.  A
speculative look came into his eyes.

"You have seen this maid, I believe," he said.

"I met her by accident.  'Twas I saved her from walking into the
Whale's Head after her father."

"You did well," he approved warmly.  "And you spoke to her?  Prithee,
Robert, what manner of maid is she?"

"Oh, fair enough," I answered, wondering what he was driving at.

"And well-spoken?" he pressed.  "I have never encountered her."

"She has the Irish way of speech."

"But is she nice in her ways?  A lady?"

"Yes."

Ben Gunn fetched in the chicken upon a salver, and my great-uncle
busied himself in carving.  'Twas comical to see how Peter's stolid
face lighted up.  As he carved Murray talked.

"She should be an exquisite chit, Robert.  She has good blood in her.
Her mother was a younger sister of the Duke of Leitrim, and her
father's father was a younger son of Lord Donegal.  She will be much
to the fore when King James returns to Whitehall."

"If he does!" I jeered.  "I marvel that you should use so hardly a
maid of such birth."

"Hardly?"  He looked up from his carving.  "Why do you say that?"

"Oh, an end to your shabby deceits and subterfuge!" I shouted.  "I
ha' told you already I know she is to be dragged aboard your ship
when you take the _Santissima Trinidad_.  What good will the Duke of
Leitrim and Lord Donegal and Jamey Stuart and all their string of
Popish knaves be to her then?  Bah!  I could stomach your treatment
of me, Murray.  But to expose a slip of a girl, scarce more than a
child, to life on this floating hell and the attentions of Flint and
his lambs!"

My great-uncle pursed his lips.

"What a vehement youth!  Friend Peter, I trust that chicken is done
to your taste?"

"_Ja_," grunted Peter, plying a ready knife and fork.

"Will a thigh be satisfactory, Robert?  This dish contains potatoes
which were fresh when we started our voyage and should be so still.
Serve Master Ormerod, Gunn.  So!  We will resume our debate.

"As to the maid's inclusion in our scheme, 'twas manifestly of the
chiefest importance that Colonel O'Donnell's connection with me be
not suspected.  And the best way to cloak that was to have his
daughter accompany him.  Not even a Spanish official--than which
there is no more suspicious breed--can carp at O'Donnell's movements
whilst she is with him."

"But why?" I persisted.  "Why all this devious deceit?  Why mix a
young maid in an unsavory intrigue?  Why make her father disloyal to
his master?"

Murray flushed crimson.

"He is not disloyal to his master," he replied with his first show of
anger.  "Colonel O'Donnell's master, my master--aye, your master--is
King James!  What doth O'Donnell care for the paltry Spaniard who
sits in the palace at Madrid?  What do any of us care for the
Spaniards, who have not been men enough to live up to their
declarations of support of the Stuarts?  Why, this girl you mouth
about would cheerfully suffer death, dishonor, any torment, to win
for her king the means of power we shall afford him.  And this
treasure, which the Spaniards have wrung from the lands they stole
from the poor Indians, we wring from them as remorselessly that we
may apply it to a purpose infinitely higher than the placating of
royal favorites and mistresses, which is the way 'twould go in
Madrid.  An unsavory business, forsooth!  Boy, are you a fool?"

There was that about his rage which benumbed my own and awakened
again the reluctant admiration which puzzled and embarrassed me.
What was it my father had said of him?

"He is sincere in a queer, twisted way."

Past doubt, he was.  I sensed a warped nobility of mind which stirred
me to sympathy and pity.  I felt of a sudden as if our places had
been reversed, as if his white hairs were mine, and his my unlined
face.

"Perhaps I am a fool," I said.  "Yet if I know nothing of your plan
and so am inclined to misconstrue it, whose fault is that?"

He dropped knife and fork and fixed me with his eyes, so marvelously
alive and bright in their setting of crow's feet and wrinkles, so
luminous with youth.

"Those are the first words you have spoken which have had any tinge
of kindness to them," he answered.

"I am not kind," I denied; "but curious.  You have torn me out of my
natural course and thrown me into a network of intrigue of which I
know nothing.  You would have me think well of you and work with you,
but you have not taken the ordinary pains to acquaint me with your
purposes and the part you have designed for me."

Peter sat back with a sigh of content, his plate empty.

"_Ja_, Murray, you don't say much," he said in his squeaky voice.
"You don't tell dot feller Flint so much as wouldt gife him der
trail."

I had not observed this, and I felt secretly ashamed.  My great-uncle
smiled.

"Stap me, but I might ha' known you would see it, Peter!" he
exclaimed.  "Now, tell me: Why did not Flint ask me the
treasure-ship's course and port o' sailing?  Did he not think to in
his fuddlement with the rum?  Or did he know I would not tell him and
reckon to save his tongue?"

"He knows you, _ja_," answered Peter.

Murray nodded.

"Yes, that would be it, and it took you to see it.  You have not
lived with the red Indians for naught, Peter.  But this doth not
answer Nephew Robert's question.  'Tis my fault you are so far
ignorant, Robert, and I will endeavor to repair the error.  I did not
seek to delude you when I told you I carried you from New York
because I needed your assistance, and that is so far true that I
admit without hesitation I must have your help before I can achieve
aught of my future plans for bettering your station in life.  In
fine, Robert, I need you at this time being more than you can need
me; and your hostageship with Flint is but the least of the services
I hope from you."

"That is frank," I replied.  "And I will match it.  I have told you
I'll not help in piracy; nor will I.  The taking of this
treasure-ship is----"

"Bide, bide," he interrupted.  "Before you commit yourself further
let me tell my story.  I ask only your promise to hold it secret from
all men on these two ships."

"I'll promise that," I said.

"_Ja_," assented Peter.

"So be it."

He left the table and took from a cupboard in the wall a rolled map
which he spread upon the table between us, shoving aside the plates
and glasses to make room for it.  I saw at a glance 'twas a chart of
the Caribbean Sea and the Spanish Main and the islands which
stretched from the tip of the Floridas to the Brazils.

"This is for reference," he remarked.  "My story begins in Europe,
and we require no map for that.  Your father, Robert, was a stout
Jacobite at your age.  He has since changed his convictions; but
we'll say nothing on that score.  I, on the contrary, was born a
Jacobite and am one still, heart and soul.  I shall never rest until
the Hanoverian usurper has been displaced.

"I was on the other side of Africa when I first had word Prince
Charles had raised the White Cockade in Scotland in the '45.  I
sailed for home, as you have heard, and was many months too late to
be of service.  But I established touch with friends in France who
work for the cause, and so learned that the good work was going
merrily on.  We all know now that Prince Charles might have remedied
his plight after Culloden had he been more fortunate in his advisers.
I will tell you beyond that that the disarming measures in the
Highlands have been a failure and the clans have only turned sullen
from the oppression they have received.  All that is wanted for
another rising is money--gold!"

His luminous, dark eyes looked from one to the other of us, and I
thought the tawny flecks in the pupils increased in brilliancy as he
cried out that last word on a rising note that thrilled and disturbed
me.

"Gold!" he said over again.  "Why, there is one little hoard of
treasure Prince Charles had to leave behind him--the Loch Arkaig
treasure they call it.  Cluny MacPherson and Locheil's brother have
had the keeping of it, and you'd scarce believe the source of trouble
it has been to the English!  And it not more than forty thousand
louis at the beginning, and dribbling fast before it was turned to
account.  It has set all the Highlands by the ears--forty thousand
louis, spent by fives and tens, a good bit of it going to feed
gillies in the heather or gambled away in some clachan of the Cameron
country, if what I hear be right.

"Think what a real treasure would accomplish!  Think what--  But I am
going too fast."

He paused, and a slow, strange smile shadowed his face as he drew a
finger across the map upon the table.

"I said I would tell you a story," he went on.  "But after all 'tis
only a dream--a wicked old man's dream, Robert.  'Tis so you think of
me, I know--and your father--and Peter there--and--I wonder what the
little maid you spoke with would think!  Or the poor, throneless old
king who huddles over his brazier for warmth in the dreary palace in
Rome that is all he has left of his majesty!  Or Prince Charlie, who
flits back and forth from France to the Low Countries, scheming and
plotting and always curbed for lack of--gold!

"Gold!  We stumble for lack of it in every enterprise.  With
sufficient of it you may upset kingdoms, buy pardons, obtain patents
and honors and place.  'Tis a definite substance, mark you, hard and
shining and heavy in the hand--not such thistle-down as dreams are
made o'.

"But the virtue of dreams, Robert--" he addressed himself direct to
me, seeming to forget that Peter was present--"is that they can be
transmuted into that which is palpable and finite, aye, even into
gold.  And the dreams of a wicked old man may become as efficacious
to right wrong or to throw down the mighty or to redeem the weak and
the persecuted as the gold which Indian slaves mine under the whip of
Spanish masters.  For the dream may lead to the gold.  What is the
ancient saw?  'First the thought, then the deed.'

"When was the thought born?  I can not say.  Flint and I had often
sought the yearly treasure-ship, but never had sight of her.  Then
one day the idea came to me to utilize my Jacobite friends in France
and Spain.  They leaped at the suggestion, for to say truth, Robert,
both Spaniards and Frenchmen have treated our party shabbily.  An
intrigue was set afoot through the medium of a cardinal who is
partial to King James, and so we gained access to the Council of the
Indies.  A bribe, which I supplied, procured for O'Donnell, already
an officer on the regular establishment of the Spanish forces,
appointment as an Inspector of Fortifications of the ports on the
Main.  And with the prestige of this post and the assistance of our
friend the cardinal 'twas easy for O'Donnell to secure complete
information as to the Council's plans for the dispatch of this year's
treasure-ship."

His forefinger explored the chart before us and came to rest upon a
dot on the flank of the narrow neck of land which joins the two
Americas.

"There is Porto Bello, which was the port of the old treasure
galleons and discarded as such by the Spaniards after Morgan sacked
it.  But later they restored and strengthened the fortifications,
although in the late war our Admiral Vernon carried it by surprize.
At that time Cartagena was the treasure center, and when Vernon
attempted it he was repulsed with loss.  Two years since the Council
of the Indies decided to resume sailings from Porto Bello, which is
the most advantageously situated of all ports on the Main for the
collection of the treasure.

"See!  'Tis about midway betwixt Mexico and Peru, and the mines of
Veragua are at its back door.  The treasures of the South Sea islands
can be fetched by sea to Panama and thence carried overland by the
_recoes_, the royal mule-trains which are the link betwixt Panama and
the West Coast and the cities of the Main.  The Peruvian treasures
come by the same route.  Those from Mexico are fetched south from La
Vera Cruz by a ship under escort of the Garda Costas and transferred
at Porto Bello to the ship for Spain, which puts forth about the
beginning or middle of September.

"This is a strong ship and well manned, but the Spaniards have been
taught by centuries of experience to accept no risk for her.  Her
identity is never known in advance, even to her captain.  He sails
from Cadiz for the Main under sealed orders which he doth not open
until mid-Atlantic is passed, and these orders do but carry him to
Porto Bello.  There a strict embargo is laid upon him and his crew,
and the port is rigidly closed the while the assembling of the
treasure is under way.  So soon as that is accomplished 'tis laded
aboard him, and he sails in the night, the hour known to no more than
the Governor and higher officers; and to make assurance surer the
port is kept closed for two weeks additional."

"Then how shall you have word of her sailing?" I broke in, swept off
my feet by the rush of this amazing narrative.

"That is O'Donnell's task.  He will reach Porto Bello during the
Summer and be so concerned for the state of the fortifications that
he'll refuse to leave until he has put them in defensible condition."

My great-uncle gave me a chiding smile.

"You ha' been vastly concerned for the well-being of the maid his
daughter, Robert--and I am bound to say your feeling is highly
becoming--but you might better fret for her health in that ---- hole
at the most pestilent time o' year.  I hope, for her sake, she will
be sent away with the officers' ladies into one of the mountain
retreats the Spaniards have erected for their refreshment."

"Better Porto Bello and pestilence than a pirate ship," I muttered
angrily.

"You will harp upon that word," he answered sorrowfully.  "I am yet
far from converting you, I perceive.  Well, well!  To my story again.

"Whilst he is there he will receive dispatches from Spain summoning
him home on urgent affairs.  He will elect to embark upon the
treasure-ship because she is large and commodious and likewise safe.
And thanks to his position, he will have accurate knowledge some days
in advance of her sailing-date.  When he has obtained this fact he
will convey it secretly to one Diego Salvez, an agent I maintain in
that port, as I maintain others in almost every place of importance
along the coast of the Main and in the islands.  Diego, by
O'Donnell's help, will get out of the town and put to sea in a fast
sloop he hath in a little river near where was the ancient town of
Nombre de Dios, so that we shall have sure tidings of the _Santissima
Trinidad's_ coming and be prepared for her."

"But what of her course?" I scrutinized the map.  "There are three
several exits from the Caribbean into the Atlantic."

And I pointed them out in order: The Straits of Florida to the north
of Cuba; the Windward Passage between Cuba and Hispaniola, with the
great island of Jamaica lying to the westward of it; and last, the
Mona Passage between Hispaniola and Porto Rico.

"She would never point up for the gaps between the lesser islands in
the south," I added.

My great-uncle chuckled with a keenness of relish that was new to him.

"You read the chart well for a landsman, boy," he said.  "What say
you, Peter?  Here is a stout sailor in the making."

"_Neen_," answered Peter earnestly.  "You stick to der landt, Bob."

And for the first time my great-uncle and I laughed together, so
comical was the Dutchman's repudiation of the sea and its folk.

"You have clapped on to the nub of our problem," said Murray.  "'Twas
the piece of information I was at most pains to obtain.  The
_Santissima Trinidad_ will head for the Mona Passage.  I will show
you why.  The first aim of the Spaniards is to conceal her voyage;
she sails a course which keeps her as much as possible in open seas.
And the best exit for that purpose is the opening between Hispaniola
and Porto Rico.  There are no islands in the Caribbean on that
course, and once through the passage she fetches south and east of
the Bahamas and so beats up for the Cape Verdes.

"My intent is that the _Royal James_ shall ply off the westerly mouth
of the passage from about the end of August, avoiding all intercourse
with shipping and keeping as far out to sea as is practicable.  When
Diego appears we will restrict the space of our beat, and 'twill be
impossible for the treasure-ship to escape us.  If she runs we can
catch her, and at fighting I can take any don under a
ship-o'-the-line."

"So much I heard you declare to Colonel O'Donnell aboard the brig," I
said.  "But what comes next?  You take the _Santissima Trinidad_--and
then?"

He moved his forefinger over the surface of the map and brought it to
rest in front of a tiny outline sketched in ink on the expanse of sea
east of Cuba and somewhat to the north of Hispaniola.  Northward of
this spot stretched the far-flung myriads of the Bahamas.

"That is what you have heard Flint and me refer to as the Rendezvous
and Spygass Island," he answered.  "It has other names, I believe.
Some have called it Treasure Island, although I know of no treasure
upon it.  In truth, its one value is that it doth not appear upon any
map, and its comfortable isolation and sheltered havens supply an
excellent resort for such outlaws as ourselves.  'Tis said that Kidd
discovered it, and certes, others of the old-time buccaneers were
wont to maintain themselves there.  Flint had the secret of it from a
tarry-breeks who claimed to have sailed on the _Adventure_ galley.
We are bound thither now to refit and careen, and when we have the
treasure safe under hatches we will return to the island to divide it
and concert arrangements for delivering their share to Colonel
O'Donnell's friends."

"What will Flint say to your fetching in strangers to your
hiding-place?" I asked.

A furrow deepened betwixt my great-uncle's lambent eyes.

"He'll not like it, Robert," he admitted.  "I have O'Donnell's word
to betray none of our secrets, and indeed 'tis to his own interest to
keep hidden his part in this affair; but Flint may well make trouble.
'Tis a determined dog, and a greedy.  Look you, boy, will you stand
by me in the affair?  For the girl's sake, if for no other reason?"

"Why not leave her aboard the treasure-ship?"

He regarded me askance.

"It may be we must sink----"

I started up.

"Now, that I'll ha' naught to do with!  I ha' told you I'd fight if
you butchered the defenseless."

He waved me back.

"Peace, peace!  We can not carry off all the Spaniards in any case,
and----"

He hesitated.

"--O'Donnell must be protected," he concluded.

"Against what?"

"Wagging tongues.  I tell you his part must never be known.  The
_Santissima Trinidad_ disappears, and with her the treasure and all
her company.  There's no other way."

"But if O'Donnell and his daughter survive to reach Europe there must
be talk," I pointed out.

"True," he agreed; "but they will have their story ready.  A
shipwreck, perhaps, and they alone contriving to reach shore."

"Who beliefes dot?" Peter interjected contemptuously.

"What else can we do?" countered Murray.

"Take the treasure, if you must," I retorted; "but do not stain your
hands with the blood of men who have not harmed you."

"I must slay some of them in all probability," returned my
great-uncle.  "What difference between that and slaying all?"

I remembered the thrill of reprobation with which even the most
devoted adherents of King George had heard of the butchery of the
Scots wounded after Culloden.

"'Tis not yourself alone must bear the disgrace of such a deed," I
tried again.  "'Twill attach an irremovable stigma to your cause.  No
honest Jacobite can ever afterward call Cumberland butcher.  Aye, and
if I know aught of Mistress O'Donnell she will refuse to have
anything to do with so horrible a crime.  Be sure 'twill bring a
trail of ill-luck will swamp the Pretender and all his train."

He took snuff with his accustomed fastidiousness.

"Your arguments carry weight, I am bound to admit," he said,
returning the box to his pocket.  "What alternative have you to
suggest?"

"Cripple the ship to give you time to escape."

"That's well enough," he argued; "but you take no thought to Colonel
O'Donnell's plight.  What will be said of him after he is brought
aboard the _James_?"

The idea which came to me then I put away as distasteful, but rack my
brain as I would I could produce no substitute for it.

"There's but one thing to do," I said.  "You must make pretense of
bearing off the daughter, and you can imprison the father, too, in
order to silence his objections."

"A fit rôle for a pirate captain," mused my great-uncle.  "_El
capitán_ Rrrip-Rrrap and how he devoured the virgin!  I can hear the
stories that will be told in the Havana wine-shops.  But I must have
my price, Robert.  If I spare such Spaniards as escape our great guns
and the boarding-cutlasses, will you agree to stand back of me in the
division of the spoils with Flint?"

"I'll not become lieutenant in your piracies, if that be your
meaning," I returned.

"No; my meaning is plain, boy.  I wish you and Peter to help me to
get clear of Flint with the O'Donnells and their portion of the
treasure."

"But why return to the Rendezvous at all?  Bear off with the
O'Donnells, and land them and their treasure before you deliver Flint
his share."

My great-uncle shook his head.

"'Tis not so simple as all that.  The action with the _Santissima
Trinidad_ will require cannonading, and that will be heard.  Probably
we shall be seen sailing away.  We may be pursued.  The surviving
Spaniards, whom you will have me spare, will speedily have out their
frigates after us.  We must remain under cover for a period.  And
finally, for various reasons too complex for discussion, I can not
make delivery of the treasure to my friends in France before the
Spring.  Seven hundred thousand pounds in gold and silver bullion is
no easy mass to handle.  Preparations must be made for its landing
and transportation.

"No, Robert, the Rendezvous is necessary to my plans.  Furthermore, I
am surprized that you, who prate so much of honor, should seek to
encourage me to act dishonorably toward my associates by withholding
from them, for however short a time, their just share of our spoils.
You will grant me, I hope, the credit of being at least an honorable
pirate."

He spoke at the last with a kind of mincing solemnity which was
vastly funny, and both Peter and I fell a-laughing for it.  Read me
for a fool or a knave if you will, but I protest I was conscious of a
growing inclination for my relative.  So whimsical a scoundrel could
not be altogether without redeeming qualities; and sure, his courage
and resource by themselves were sufficient to set him apart from
ordinary men.

"Very well," I said.  "I will do what you ask for the maid's sake--if
Peter is willing."

"_Ja_," assented Peter.

Murray caught my hand in a quick, firm clasp.

"Good!" he cried.  "'Twill be the first o' many times we stand
shoulder to shoulder.  Ah, Robert, I ha' dreamed a splendid dream,
and any man who helps in its achievement will not have lived in vain.
We'll take this gold and build an avenue of victories for the king's
ride to Whitehall.  What will we not do?  We'll rouse the claymores
from the hills!  We'll carry the Irish Brigade to London town!  We'll
fetch home the Wild Geese from their haunts of exile!  We'll ha' the
beacon fires ablaze from end to end of the Three Kingdoms!  And the
White Cockade over all!

"There'll be no talk of pirates then!  'Twill be my Lord Duke of
Jedburgh, Marquis of Cobbielaw and Earl and Baron Broomfield; aye,
and an English peerage to boot.  We'll ride high, Robert--aye, with
the highest!"

He broke off short, and the glow in his eyes charred out.

"'Tis not a bad vision for a wicked old man to dream; eh, boy?
Remember it when you hear the crowds a-cheering us in the Strand."

Almost he made me believe him, this outlaw of the sea.  But Peter
broke the spell.

"Me, I don't beliefe in dreams," yawned the Dutchman.  "_Neen_."

Murray glared at him.

"What you believe is of little account, Corlaer," he said curtly, and
strode from the cabin.

Peter took a sip of aqua vitae.

"He is a great dreamer, Murray," he squeaked.  "_Ja_, all der time he
dreams.  He dreamed when we fight wit' him before, me andt your
father, Bob.  It is not goodt to dream too much, _neen_."

He sighed.

"My stomach is better.  We finish der chicken, _ja_?"




CHAPTER IX

THE ISLAND

One day was like another aboard the _Royal James_, although to a
landsman the routine of duties, work and varying weather was charged
with unending interest.  My great-uncle held his pack of wolves on a
short leash and exacted from them all the efficiency of a
man-o'-war's company.  Indeed, he rather fancied himself in the
status of admiral upon a private establishment, and occasionally
indulged in visions of the _James_ gazetted to the roster of the
royal fleet and himself flying a broad pennant in a line-ship at the
head of a squadron.

"His Majesty could scarce make me Lord Admiral, Robert," he would
say, pacing the poop with hands clasped behind him and spyglass
tucked beneath his left arm.  "I am one for maintaining the rights of
tradition, and the Howards have an inalienable claim to the place.
But a regular commission--that would be vastly different.  Admiral of
the White, let us say--or if that grade be filled, perhaps of the
Red.  I understand there to be considerable jealousy amongst the
sea-dogs of the Navy over the rankings on the White, and I am a
reasonable man.  Military or naval fitness must never be sacrificed
to political ends.  'Tis a canker will wreck the most powerful State
in time."

Each morning he inspected the ship from stem to stern, accompanied by
his officers, and he was not slow to administer rebukes for
shortcomings or oversights.  Later in the forenoon the men were
exercised at the great guns, and in the afternoon there was pike and
cutlass drill.  The watch was rigorously maintained.  We carried
lookouts day and night at all three mast-heads and on poop and
fo'csle, and every one of them was equipped with an observation
glass.  The handling of the sails was astonishingly smart to me, who,
of course, had had no previous experience to go by.

The cleanliness of the decks and living-quarters was beyond any
peradventure of criticism.  Even the men of the crew--as choice a
collection of hangman's favorites, jail-breakers, road-wanderers,
hedge-thieves, pickpockets, murderers and mutineers as could have
been mustered upon one deck--were kept personally tidy and clothed
with a rough similarity in wide trousers of tough canvas, gaudy
shirts of calico and round-jackets of Irish frieze.

There was plenty of food, and of far better quality than is served on
King's ships, as I have since learned, and enough rum to keep all
hands in good humor without being drunk.  None of this broaching a
cask on the spar-deck according to Flint's habit, but a full pannikin
three times a day.  And in tropical waters, so Master Martin told me,
Murray was at great pains to keep the ship stocked with fresh fruit
to prevent the scurvy and the wasting fevers of the hot latitudes.

The officers lodged for'ard of the cabin in what answered, I suppose,
for a gun-room.  Murray had the poop quarters to himself, with only
Peter and me for company, aside from Ben Gunn and the two negro
lackeys, who were more for show than aught else, seeing that the
steward did practically all the work.

With our accommodations I could find no cause for quarrel.  My
great-uncle had promised me I should fare like an admiral, and
certes, like an admiral or a princeling did I fare.  There was a
stateroom each for Peter and me, and whilst constricted in space by
shore standards, they were spacious beside the cubby-hole we had
shared aboard the brig.

The main cabin I have already described, but I may add that in
addition to its artistic decorations it possessed a well-chosen
library of Latin, French, Italian, Spanish and British authors,
including such recent works as our own Cadwallader Colden's "History
of the Iroquois Nations," which my father esteemed a masterpiece of
historical authority; Smollet's novels, several pamphlets and slim
volumes dealing with the experiences of spirited gentlemen who had
participated in the struggles of the '45; and a variety of
philosophical studies and disquisitions upon political economy.
Perceiving that I displayed some interest in it, my great-uncle
commended to my attention Monsieur de Montesquieu's "Spirit of Laws,"
Cervantes' "Don Quixote," the "Satyricon" of Petronius, Carte's
monumental "Life of the Duke Ormond" and Clarendon's "History of the
Rebellion."

"There, Robert," he remarked of the last, "is an object-lesson in the
success to which a man may attain by application, diplomacy and
native genius.  My Lord Clarendon began life as a commoner; yet he
lived to see his daughter married to the brother of the King of
England, and only by the obscure bafflements of fate was he prevented
from beholding the offspring of her body occupying the holy eminence
of the throne.  I have derived much satisfaction from the
contemplation of his success in moments when I might have despaired
of the future's reward of my own efforts."

He was particular that I should be well garbed, and forced upon me
several suits out of his abundant wardrobe which were given the
necessary alterations by a former journeyman tailor who had escaped
from Newgate on the eve of execution for the murder of a scolding
wife.  He would have done as much for Peter also; but the Dutchman
refused to be parted from his salt-stained buckskin shirt and
leggings; and an odd figure Corlaer made, in all conscience, striding
the decks of the _Royal James_ in the costume of a forest-runner,
even to the knife and hatchet hung on either thigh.

We were fortunate in our weather until we had gained the latitude of
Florida, when a northwesterly storm drove us some hundreds of miles
out of our course and separated us for several weeks from our
consort.  By reason of this misadventure we were obliged to beat back
to the north in order to take advantage of the trades to run down
upon the island from the nor'east, which was highly essential, so my
great-uncle said, else we must be compelled to thread the dangerous
mazes of the Bahama group or sail uncomfortably close to the eastern
coast of Cuba.

To the west of the Bermoothes--within sight of which we never
came--we encountered the _Walrus_ again, Flint having had
substantially the same experience as ourselves, and thenceforward we
continued in company.  Other ships we occasionally sighted from the
mast-head; but as Murray was particularly anxious to avoid calling
attention to his presence the cry, "Sail ho!" was the signal for our
bearing off upon any course which would fetch a compass around the
strangers.  This fact, together with the time lost through the storm,
protracted the voyage near a month beyond what might have been
expected, and we were eleven weeks out of New York when a cluster of
rocky peaks soared above the heat-haze dead ahead.

My great-uncle, after a single squint through his object-glass,
handed the instrument to me.

"'Tis the island," he said.  "I'd know those peaks anywhere."

The double lens etched distinctly a rugged spread of land, shelving
up out of the sea from a succession of yellow beaches on the east to
a series of small hills which culminated in a range of considerable
height along the westward side, running almost due north and south.
The interior seemed to be heavily forested; the trees climbed the
mountains to within the last few hundred feet of their summits, which
were bare rock, precipitous in the case of the midmost and highest, a
cloud-hung giant which dominated the island.

"That is Spyglass Hill," said my great-uncle, noting the intentness
of my survey of it.  "'Tis there we maintain our lookouts whilst we
are in harbor, and some men give the name of the hill to the island.
But in truth the place hath no set name, and is dubbed by each to
suit his fancy.  You may judge this to be all the more so when I add
that Spyglass Hill is known likewise as Mainmast Hill.  Do you see
the two other high peaks in line with it, north and south?  That to
the nor'ard is called Foremast Hill, and its twin in the south is
Mizzenmast Hill."

We were on the la'b'd tack, clawing off to work eastward of the
island's mass, and as he spoke we opened up a sizable bight.  Rocky
headlands fell away to tree-clad shores, and I caught the gleam of a
little river which flowed into the upper end of the basin.

"Is that our haven?" I asked.

"No, 'tis in no sense as secure as that which we customarily use,"
replied Murray, "although safe enough in storm.  It is called the
North Inlet.  The principal harbor is known as Captain Kidd's
Anchorage, and is bitten into the so'east corner of the island.  We
shall not open it for another two glasses."

The breeze was dwindling, which was fortunate for us as we required
plenty of sea-room to weather the island; and the east coast, though
flat and sandy, offered no feasible harbor or roadstead.  The surf
boomed up on the beaches with a steady roar which we could hear above
the creaking of our vessel's cordage and the shrieking of the
sea-birds whose countless flocks wheeled overhead as we approached.
A half-mile astern of us the _Walrus_ was bouncing in our wake.
Seaward in every quarter the horizon-line melted into the infinite
expanse of the ocean.

To me, used to the busy life of a bustling little town or the tossing
treetops of the forests of the wilderness, cloaking beneath their
restless boughs all manner of wild and savage life, there was
something appalling in the isolation of the blotch of land ahead of
us.

A continent in miniature, complete with capes, bays, inlets, rivers,
mountains, woods and fields, it was yet so utterly desolate in its
setting of blue-green water.  Actually, I believe, 'twas as much as
three leagues in length from north to south, and perhaps better than
a league across at its widest.  But as I stared at it from the poop
of the _Royal James_ it seemed less than the green dot of Nutting
Island,[1] which lies in the mouth of the East River over against New
York.  And what scenes of heart-rending cruelty it had witnessed!
What acts of ruthless perfidy!


[1] Governors Island.


Nearing its shores, I descried the tangled masses of trees which
clothed most of its surface.  A few conifers shot up to goodly
stature, but the greater part of the forest growth was gnarled,
wind-tortured dwarfs, misshapen abortions of trees.  The whole effect
of the place seen from offshore was sinister and forbidding,
repulsive as the silent ferocity which emanated from the blind man
Pew.

The crew of the _Royal James_ eyed the unfolding shoreline with a
slackness of interest which surprized me.  Men did not talk together.
There was no jesting.  The bracing of the sheets and trimming of the
yards brought forth no more than the customary amount of shouting and
"yo-ho-hoing" without which the sailorman is powerless for good or
ill.

I commented upon this; and my great-uncle, silently contemplative
beside me, smiled.

"If the ensuing weeks meant leisure and carousing it might be we
should be put to it to maintain our standard of discipline," he said.
"But as it chances, our crew find confronting them a task of
difficulty and duration, the which they know and realize.  And
therefore, Robert, are they silent, and not because of the spell of
evil deeds which you think to decipher from our surroundings.  Evil
enough the island hath known, I doubt not.  What place could not as
much be said of?  But men, and especially seamen, reck little of an
evil past if land be usefully available for their needs.  No, no, my
boy; you shall sleep securely tonight in Captain Kidd's Anchorage,
for all the ghostly memories it contains.  And Peter shall eat
without a qualm, for the _James_ will lie as still as the dry land in
the haven's shelter."

"We get some fenison, _ja_," spoke up Peter, with marked enthusiasm
for him.

He pointed toward the slopes of a hill this side of the Spyglass, and
I had a brief glimpse of a string of white dots which leaped from
crag to crag.

Murray laughed.

"You have keen eyes, friend Peter," he observed.  "But if you will
accept the aid of my glass you will perceive that what you saw were
goats--the descendants, we are told, of a flock left here by the old
buccaneers, to whom we owe an appreciable debt therefor.  Goatflesh
is not venison by long odds, but it hath much to commend it over salt
beef and pork, and the tender bits of a young kid seethed in the milk
of its dam--we are not obligated to obey the Mosaic code--might
appeal even to an epicure of as unquestioned taste as yourself.
There are, too, certain wildfowl and a breed of duck not to be
despised; and we shall have much store of fish and shellfish.  Yes, I
can assure you additions to our diet which should go far to reconcile
you with your lot."

Peter's face shone.

"Dot's goodt," he said.  "_Ja_, now I fill oop my stomach wit'out it
yumps from der wafes."

Several miles south of this mountain we sighted a white rock on a
point of land and beyond it an islet and beyond that a much larger
island.  Murray ordered the helmsman to edge away to the east, and
presently we bore off on a long tack to the so'east to fetch us
around a patch of shoals.  A man was ordered into the forechains with
a leadline, and several others relayed his soundings aft along the
deck to the poop.  The water shoaled rapidly from ten fathoms to five
and a trifle less; but Murray conned his way coolly, the _Walrus_
scrupulously exact in our wake, and of a sudden we went about on the
starboard tack and opened a wider, deeper harbor even than the North
Inlet, on the right hand the shores of the smaller island, on the
left the main itself.

My great-uncle turned over the conduct of the ship to Martin and
crossed to where Peter and I stood, staring about us.  Already we
were under the lee of the smaller island, and the ship was making
less way as the force of the wind was decreased.  The water seemed
strangely quiet--instead of bouncing us up and down, it did no more
than purr and ripple as the bow cleaved through it.  And the heat of
the sun, unrelieved by the free sweep of the wind, became intense.
In a few moments the decks were hot to the touch, and we might not
lay our hands with comfort upon the bulwarks.

Here were no beaches; only mud-banks covered to the waterline with
twisting, many-rooted trees, their foliage of an ardently soft green
presenting impenetrable, whispering barriers to the eye.  The channel
curved, following the contour of the smaller island, and we sighted
the mouth of a little river similar to that which had flowed into the
head of the North Inlet.

"Starboard, Master Martin!" called my great-uncle as he joined Peter
and me.  "Starboard your helm, if you please.  Aye, on to this shoal
here.  We shall have three fathoms and less to careen in.  Bid them
drop the anchor."

Martin bawled an order.  A whistle piped, and there was a great
clatter and rustling of rope running loose, a mighty splash that
drove the birds in tumult into the air; and the _Royal James_ swung
to her cable close under the lesser island's shore.  My great-uncle
waved one hand over the bulwark.

"Skeleton Island this is called, Robert," he said.  "I tell you
because you demonstrate so gruesome an interest in the more
horrifying episodes of our past.  But I regret I must confess that I
know of no authentic detail to account for the nomenclature.  Pirates
have a way of naming a spot to suit themselves, without rime or
reason, if the fancy once moves them."

"May we land?" I answered, ignoring his gibe.

"Suit yourselves," he returned with a shrug.  "I must have all my men
busy aboard here, however, and can spare none to guide you."

"_Ja, ja_," urged Peter.  "We shoodt some goats, eh?"

"If you please," agreed Murray.  "Ben Gunn will find you a brace of
light muskets preferable to our rack-blunderbusses.  I'll have the
gig put overside, and you may row yourselves, if you will."

"Are you not afraid we may plan to escape?" I asked curiously.

"How?" he countered.  "Look about you."

"We might fashion ourselves a vessel," I declared.  "A raft, at the
least."

"And whither would you go?" he pressed me.  "These seas are
unfrequented and tempestuous.  Also, I do not think that you would be
able to construct a vessel in the amount of uninterrupted time I
should allow you.  And finally, my dear nephew, I must remind you
that you have promised your aid to me in a certain matter."

"I need not consider that binding in event of an opportunity to
escape," I retorted.

"You need not perhaps," said he.  "Yet you would."

And with that he walked off and bade Saunders order the gig lowered
overside.  Nor did he say another word until we had secured our
weapons and a packet of food from Ben Gunn and returned to the deck.
Then he gave over supervising the cock-billing of the mainyard and
joined us at the gangway.

"I desire above all things, Robert," he said, "to deal gently with
you.  Therefore I ask you to believe I am considering your own safety
when I require your promise to be aboard again not later than an hour
after sundown."

"Why, what harm----"

The _Walrus_ slatted past us, her canvas in a slovenly mess alow and
aloft, a dozen men howling orders and counter-orders from poop, waist
and fo'csle, Flint in his red coat strutting the poop and adding his
own bellow to the din whenever the confusion showed signs of
dissolving.  Pew was huddled over the wheel, the green eyeshade
masking his powder-burned eyes, John Silver tall beside him,
a-leaning on the carven mahogany crutch, his cool, pleasant voice the
one sensible sound in the tumult on those disordered decks.

My great-uncle's eyes strayed across the narrow gap of water betwixt
the two vessels.

"Well, damme, it's been a ---- of a voyage, Murray!" shouted Flint.

"We are here," returned my great-uncle urbanely.

"Aye, and what to do wi' ourselves?" Flint called back.  "Blast me
for a ---- ---- ---- if I can see what five hundred ---- ---- ----
are to do wi' months on their hands, and naught but rum-drinkin' and
quarrellin' for diversion."

"There's your ship to clean, man," replied Murray.  "She needs it."

Flint answered with a curse.  The _Walrus_ had slid on too far for
all his words to be distinct, but I heard a fragment of the beginning.

"--use o' cleaning' ship?  Only a ---- ---- swab o' a ---- ---- Navy
officer 'ud think to ---- ---- his ----"

My great-uncle indulged in one of his essentially Gallic shrugs and
dusted a pinch of snuff into his nostrils.

"Captain Flint doth not agree with me, it seems.  A strange
character, and eke a forceful one, Robert, for all his inherent
stupidity and blindness of view.  But to return to your question.
You were about to ask me what harm could befall you ashore.  I answer
you that I do not know, but that in all candid truth we are here, to
quote my associate, some 'five hundred ---- ---- ----,' and accidents
may happen.  Therefore, I suggest that you be aboard not later than
an hour after sunset.  On second thoughts, Robert, I regret that I
shall be unable to permit you to leave the ship save upon your parole
on those terms."

"You have it," I answered shortly, and followed Peter down the
side-cleats into the gig.

We rowed up the estuary for the mouth of the little river which we
had seen from the _James'_ deck, and our course took us under the
yellow hull of the _Walrus_.  A shrill voice hailed from a gunport,
and Darby McGraw's red head was thrust out beside the frowning black
muzzle.

"Glory be, Master Bob, and do they let ye go free wherever ye will?
Sure, it's yourself must be one o' the grand favorites over yon.  Are
ye an officer yet?"

I was about to answer him when Flint gloomed down at us from the
towering poop.

"Gut me!" he sneered.  "'Tis Murray's by-blow, no less!  What d'ye
make o' this, Billy?"

The brutal face of Bones showed above the bulwarks.

"He's a pris'ner," jeered Bones.  "Only he ain't; d'ye see, Flint?
Into New York Murray went to crimp him, and now, by ---- ---- ---- he
gives him shore-leave!"

"Come aboard here, my hearty," Flint hailed me.

"We are going ashore," I answered; "and I have reason to hasten."

Flint scowled.

"Well, ye'll come soon enough.  And when I get ye I'll learn ye a
thing or two!  There's too much politics and favoritism aboard the
_James_ to suit me, and ye can tell your great-uncle or granddaddy or
whatever he may be, blast him for a ---- ---- ---- ---- ----, that
John Flint says so!"

Darby bobbed up on the poop beside him very much out of breath.

"Och, will ye let me go along o' Master Bob, captain?" he cried.  "Do
now, avick!  Sure, I hain't seen him this long three-month gone."

"That I'll not," snarled Flint, turning his back to us.  "Isn't this
ship good enough for ye, Darby?  Ain't you our luck?  Will I let you
go and ruin it by rounding up wi' Murray's by-blow?"

"Troth, he's no more'n the old master's son that I worrked for in New
York, captain darlin', and him that good to me always I had a main
likin' for him, indeed and indeed I did!  And I'm fair crazy to be
ashore afther the weeks and months we'll ha'----"

Flint clapped him on the shoulder, abruptly jovial.

"Ah, if it's ashore you'd be that's a different matter," says he.
"I'm for goin' ashore myself.  Bill, call all hands away for the
boats, and we'll have a grand goat-hunt up Spyglass.  John Silver
shall barbecue 'em for us.  And break out a couple o' casks o' rum.
Lively now, my lads!  We'll enjoy ourselves like the honest pirates
we are!"

A frenzy of cheering answered him, and I backed water with my oars.

"You heard, Peter?" I said over my shoulder.

"_Ja_; dot's badt."

"We can't go where they do."

"_Neen_."

I reflected and examined the surface of the main island, rearing
itself before us on the opposite side of the estuary.  A half-mile,
perhaps, eastward of the river we had been heading for a second and
less inviting stream oozed its way into the haven through a
succession of swamps.  Beyond it toward the island's eastern shore
the country was sandy and open.  The Spyglass and the intervening
hills were miles to the west, clear across the island and the two
streams.

"There we'll be safe, Peter," I said.  "They're not going in that
direction, and if they do by chance come after us we'll be able to
see them."

"Maybe we better go back to der ship," he answered doubtfully.

"Not I," I returned grimly.  "We won't look for trouble; but if it
comes our way we'll meet it."

"_Ja_,"  he said, and bent to his oars.

We did not enter the second stream, because the swamps along its
course presented no landing-place, but ran our boat aground on a
sandy bank on the far side of a point which concealed us from the
_Walrus_.  Then we took our guns and walked inland through the trees
up a graduated sandy slope to the top of a little hillock whence we
could look off through the aisles of pines and see the _Walrus_, with
boats putting off from her sides and pulling into the mouth of the
first of the two streams, and over a spur of Skeleton Island the
topmasts of the _Royal James_.

"This would be a good place for a fort," I mused.

"_Ja_," said Peter.  "You got water, too."

He pointed to a streak of green vegetation along the sandy slope of
the knoll which we traced to a spring issuing from the summit.

"Now we got water, we better eat," he added.

"But what about the goats?" I cried.  "We were to----"

"No," he insisted stubbornly; "we don't shoodt.  If we shoodt, der
pirates hear us andt come.  We waidt until they are all ashore.  Then
we go back to Murray."

"I'll not be driven from the first pleasure we have had in months," I
protested childishly.

"We do it again," replied Peter placidly.  "Next time Murray he come
wit' us himself, _ja_."

"Yes, but----"

"Now you be sensible, Bob.  Der Injuns is goodt friendts beside them
fellers, _ja_.  We go back to der _James_.  Soon all o' them be
ashore andt drunk.  Drunk, they like to kill us, but they can't
row--_neen_."

And we rowed back to the _James_ ingloriously in the dusk, the shouts
of the _Walrus'_ carousers echoing to us from the shore.




CHAPTER X

HOSTAGES

The watch aboard the _Royal James_ challenged us as we made fast by
the larboard side-ladder, and when we climbed over the bulwarks to
the deck Master Martin flashed a lanthorn in our faces with a gust of
oaths in his absurdly gentle tones.

"By the ---- ---- ---- ----, but I hoped 'twas that ---- ---- Flint
come a-seekin' mischief," he complained.

"Where is Captain Murray?" I answered.

"In his cabin."

And in the same mild manner he continued to his men:

"To your stations.  Remember cap'n's orders.  Now these two are
aboard, ye'll fire at any boat that approaches and challenge
afterward."

The negro lackeys stood aside as we came to the cabin entrance under
the poop; the door was open.  Down the dark tunnel of the
companionway with its stateroom doors on either hand Peter and I
could see my great-uncle sitting at the table in the main cabin, a
glass of wine at his elbow, a chart spread out before him.  He raised
his head as we entered.

"You were cheated of your sport, I conclude," he greeted us.  "The
watch informed me a half-hour since they had heard no shots ashore."

I recounted briefly our conversation with Flint and the determination
Peter and I had reached in consequence.  He nodded agreement with it.

"You did quite right, Robert.  Peter did not exaggerate the dangers
inherent in the situation."

"You appear not to feel any too safe yourself," I answered
sarcastically, "with sentinels posted on your decks ordered to shoot
into any approaching boat."

"I do not," he assented with perfect equanimity.  "'Tis true I should
be surprized did our confrères of the _Walrus_ undertake to assault
us, but I have had too much experience with desperate men, especially
when they are under the influence of liquor, to discount the
possibility of their adopting any atrocious idea which might enter
their heads."

"Do you mean that you live in perpetual fear of treachery from
Flint's crew?"

He considered the question, sipping at his wine.

"Perpetual is too strong a word for the occasion," he decided at
length.  "Let us say rather that the experience to which I have
previously referred has taught me that under certain
circumstances--such as the license practised after the tedium of a
long voyage--a band of men who recognize no authority save the strong
arm may be induced to excesses they would not otherwise attempt."

"Then we don't shoodt no goats?" asked Peter sorrowfully.

"On the contrary, friend Peter.  We most certainly shall.  'Tis not
only a question of securing you the opportunity of sport which I
promised you, but of varying the diet of my crew, with an eye to
maintaining all hands in good health at a time when we can not afford
incapacity.  Tomorrow morning I shall be occupied in organizing the
work of careening the ship, so that her bottom may be cleaned; but in
the afternoon we will take a party of beaters to aid us and arrange a
battue in the Continental fashion.  By that time, I anticipate,
Captain Flint will have returned to his senses--recovered from his
debauch, in other words.  If he has not----"

He shrugged, and I gathered that the contingency would not be a happy
one for Flint.

"You will excuse me," he went on, "if I return to my studies.  I have
much upon my mind."

We bade him good night and went to our staterooms, weary enough from
the unwonted exercise of rowing.  As I shut my door I noted that he
was measuring distances in the Caribbean with calipers and jotting
figures upon the margin of the chart.

In the morning, as he had said, all hands were occupied with the task
of careening the ship.  In the first place she was to be hauled over
to starboard to expose her larboard bottom, and all her guns and
movable stores and heavy equipment were shifted to starboard to give
her a list on that side.  Then her yards were cockbilled to keep them
clear of the water, and heavy cables were run from her masts to the
shore, looped around trees and carried back aboard, and the crew by
main force, a few inches or a foot at a time, canted her over.  The
tide, as it dropped, aided them by bedding the keel in the estuary's
soft mud floor, and gradually the _James_ came to assume a most
lopsided appearance.

'Twas when the work had gone so far and was proceeding satisfactorily
that my great-uncle bade Martin tell off a dozen hands who were good
shots and call away the longboat.

"I marvel that you dare to leave the _James_ in this defenseless
condition," I said to him as the longboat pulled off up the anchorage
past the silent bulk of the _Walrus_.  "If there was danger last
night----"

"--there need not necessarily be danger this afternoon," he
interrupted.  "'Tis all quiet ashore, and I doubt if there is a man
sufficiently sober aboard the _Walrus_ to carry a carton of powder
from the magazine."

"But by evening they'll ha' slept it off," I insisted.

"True, and with it their lust for bloodshed--for the time being, at
any rate.  Our problem then will be to turn Flint's mind to some
undertaking which will divert his attention and occupy him until we
need no longer be concerned for his whimsies."

We landed south of the first river, below where Flint's party had
held their carouse, and proceeded inland through a wooded valley,
with hills rising to right and left of us and the Spyglass towering
in the distance.  The day was very clear, and the mountain's summit
was a gray cone against the blue of the sky.  A soft wind whispered
in the trees; the beat of the surf came to us faintly; the severity
of the sun was tempered by the shade; and the pine-mast was springy
to our feet.  Even our sullen, hangdog escort of seamen became almost
cheery under the influence of their changed surroundings, and with
the sight of their first goat they began to whoop and shout like
schoolboys.  Murray, despite his age, was as spry as the youngest of
us, and he never wasted a shot.

At his suggestion we turned north along the lower flanks of the
Spyglass, circled the intervening hills--foot-hills they might be
called--crossed the headwaters of the first river, traversed another
patch of forest and forded the second river at a point where it ran
shallow and clear between two of the marshy stretches which were its
distinguishing characteristic.  This route brought us over to the
eastern side of the island some distance north of the hillock Peter
and I had visited the preceding evening, and when I remarked this
fact my great-uncle expressed interest and requested that we should
visit the place.  We had by now shot sufficient goats to load down
all our bearers, whilst Peter carried half a dozen brace of various
birds, to the eatable qualities of which Murray bore testimony.

We had maintained a brisk pace on our wanderings, and we reached the
site of the spring well before sunset.  My great-uncle surveyed the
situation with a calculating eye, estimated the stand of timber on
the hill's sides, and exclaimed that there was no neighboring
eminence whence an enemy could command it.

"'Tis all you have asserted it to be," he said.  "Moreover, it gives
me an idea of a way in which we may occupy the energies of Captain
Flint and his lambs for the ensuing weeks of our stay."

I asked him what he intended, but he would not answer me, striding
off with his head sunk on his chest after his manner when plunged in
thought.  The seamen, who had awaited us at the foot of the hill,
fell in behind us, and we retraced our steps across the swampy river
and the intervening belt of forest to the first and larger stream.
This, too, we recrossed, but instead of continuing on as we had come
Murray turned down the course of the stream in a south-easterly
direction.  A thread of smoke trickled up beside the mouth of the
rivulet in the woods along the estuary, and I indicated it to him.

"There is Flint," I said.

"Yes," he replied absently, and kept on.

The shadows were lengthening as we stepped out of the forest into a
glade on the river's bank.  Several additional fires had been
kindled, and around each were huddled groups of pirates much the
worse for the last night's drinking-bout.  John Silver was the only
man who appeared to have any animation left in him; he hopped on his
crutch from one fire to another, supervising the roasting of the
haunches of goat, which were spitted in front of the flames with
pieces of hardtack placed beneath to catch the dripping juices.
'Twas he first saw us, and evidently spoke to Flint, who sat with
Bones and several other cronies at the smallest of the fires.  He
swung toward us as Flint rose unsteadily and tacked in his wake.

"Come a-visitin', captain?" Silver inquired cheerfully.  "Mighty kind
o' ye, sir, seein' as how most o' our lads is a bit the worse for
liquor and blood-lettin'.  My duty to ye, Master Ormerod.  I hopes I
sees you and your friend well?"

"Blood-letting?" repeated Murray, ignoring the balance of his
remarks.  "The old story, eh?  Well, well!  You'll never learn.  How
many for the sailmaker's palm and needle?"

"Three, captain.  And main lucky we are as----"

Flint lurched up beside him.

"Stow that, John," growled his captain.  "I'll do the talkin'.
What's your trouble, Murray?"

My great-uncle took a pinch of snuff with his inimitable knack of
expressing acute disgust without moving a muscle of his face.

"I have been a-hunting," he replied.  "Shooting for the pot.  We
stopped on the way to our boat to pass the time o' day with you,
Flint."

Flint snorted

"Time o' day!  ----!  'Tain't like you to take the trouble."

"I am a person of most uncertain proclivities," replied my
great-uncle.  "I hear from Silver that last night's episode was
accompanied by the usual fatalities."

"Three," assented Flint.  "Two o' 'em could be spared--lousy dogs.
The other was Toby Welsh, as stout a fellow as we had."

"Not bad for one night's work," commented Murray.

Flint was obviously in no very belligerent mood; he could scarce
stand.  But he flamed up at this.

"Aye, and what d'ye expect?  How many months did ye tell me I must
bide here wi' a crew that knows naught but how to brew the Devil's
broth?  And how many men d'ye think will be alive by the end of the
time?  Gut me, but 'twill be like the song we sing o' the Dead Man's
Chest!"

"I fear it will," agreed my great-uncle.  "Unless you take measures
to prevent it."

"Measures?"

Flint cursed with the fluency of the man who enjoys his work.

"There's a deal to be done in keeping twelvescore men from fighting
on this chunk o' earth and rock!"

"There's your ship to be cleaned," said my great-uncle tentatively.

"I'd ha' mutiny on my hands did I call for it!  They're all for a run
ashore, and there'll be no working them aboard-ship until they ha'
had their fill o' woods and mountains."

"Ah!" said my great-uncle.  "Doubtless that is so.  Well, if they
must remain ashore a time, is it not in their own interest to erect
themselves some shelter from the elements?"

Flint stared at him curiously.

"Ye've an idea in the back o' your head, Murray.  Out with it!"

"We have often said that some day we should build ourselves a fort on
the island," answered my great-uncle.

"We ha'."

"I came upon the ideal spot this afternoon--a sand hillock overgrown
with fine pines and oaks eastward of the swamps.  It hath the airs
from the ocean, a good prospect of the anchorage and the nearer
waters, and there is a spring at the very top."

"And I'm to do the work!" snarled Flint.

"Your men are to do the work," corrected Murray.  "I should gladly
assist them in it but for the fact that my own crew will be occupied
aboardship during the duration of our stay.  We of the _Royal James_,
I may point out, are laboring in the common interest no less than
your people will be if they undertake the construction of the fort."

"Blast me for a ---- ---- fool if I care two ---- ---- ---- for the
common interest!" cried Flint.  "But 'tis true there is need of the
fort, and if the men will bide ashore they should ha' a roof to their
heads and a better place to camp than down here in the river vapors.
I'll see what's to be done, Murray.  Not tonight--there's no man of
us, except Long John, curse him!  can put two thoughts together.  But
in the morning 'twill be different.  We'll fetch off a boatload o'
axes and shovels, and I'll turn 'em to.  I think it can be done.
---- me, it must be done!  I can't lose three men a day for the next
six months!"

"You'll not regret it," replied my great-uncle.  "I shall be glad to
lend you aught I possess in the way of tools or advice."

"---- your advice!" snapped Flint.  "The tools I'll take.  Is that my
hostage wi' you?"

"'Tis my grandnephew, yes."

"Ye may as well leave him then.  We can use him on the fort.  He's
not too proud to hand and haul, is he?"

Murray stepped so close to him that notwithstanding the dimness of
the twilight their faces were clearly discernible to each other.

"When the time comes for it my grandnephew will be placed in your
hands, Flint," he said quietly.  "And I shall hold you strictly
accountable for his treatment."

His manner chilled.

"D'ye hear, man?  Strictly accountable, I said.  The feckless knave
that lays a finger to him, who has my own blood in his veins, shall
be flayed alive and bound to the bowsprit of the _James_."

"Oh, aye," mumbled Flint, and faded into the shadows.

Long John Silver, who had tarried within earshot throughout their
dialogue, stumped forward again.

"It grows sudden dark in these 'ere latitoods, captain!" he said.
"Will ye ha' one o' our boats to take ye off?"

"I thank you," replied my great-uncle.  "We shall have no difficulty
in finding our boat."

He did not speak again until we were pulling across the star-flecked
waters of the anchorage.

"I think," he announced casually, "we need have no cause to worry
over the defenseless condition of the _James_."

"A dozen shot under water--" I started to say, when Peter spoke up.

"He gets them all ashore, Bob.  _Ja_, dot's it!  All der time they
work, andt so they don't think about der _James_."

"A singularly acute mind our Peter has," commented my great-uncle.

His strategy was completely successful.  The building of the hilltop
fort appealed to some boyish strain submerged beneath the surface
villainy of Flint's scoundrels.  They went to their task with
positive enthusiasm, clearing the hillock of timber, sawing and
squaring the logs and erecting a substantial house of the more
massive logs and after that an open stockade or paling of sapling
stakes six feet high.  The house-walls were loop-holed for musketry,
and Flint commenced to talk of a pair of bastions to hold
six-pounders; but this was after the work had gone forward two months
and his men were becoming weary of ax and saw.

Toward the end of our sojourn the _Walrus'_ crew were committed to a
serious effort to exterminate the goats of the island, and since this
occupation was to be preferred to the extermination of one another,
which was their favorite sport when their energies were not otherwise
diverted, nobody was inclined to stop them, my great-uncle least of
all.

His personal object was already accomplished.  The _Royal James_ was
back upon an even keel, her bottom scraped clean, her hull
fresh-painted inside and out, her rigging overhauled and canvas in
order, spars tested and a weak top-mast replaced, guns varnished,
stores checked and stowed, sufficient great-cartridge for three
actions prepared by the gunner, ballast aboard and distributed with a
careful eye for sailing trim.

"As sweet and proper as though she was just from the hands of the
dockyard fitters at Portsmouth," was Murray's comment on an evening
about the beginning of August.

The three of us sat at table in the main cabin, Peter still occupied
with the fragments of a wild pigeon.  Through the open stern windows
drifted a tag-end of song from the _Walrus_, lying a cable's length
higher up the anchorage:

  "The Frenchman took Moon's knife in the throat--
    Yo-ho-ho, and a bottle o' rum!
  But all they found was a rusty groat--
    Yo-ho-ho, and a bottle o' rum!"


"That is Flint's voice," continued my great-uncle.  "I am glad he is
aboardship.  'Twill save us the inconvenience of a journey ashore."

And to the query of my raised eyebrows he replied:

"The tide ebbs on the break of dawn.  I purpose sailing then."

"And you must deliver the body of your hostage beforehand," I
answered as disagreeably as I could.

"Even so," he acknowledged.  "'Tis regrettable, Robert, yet the time
will come, I venture to predict, when you will look back with pride
upon the inconvenience you suffered."

"I'll accept the inconvenience if I may escape the rascals alive," I
retorted.

"Of that you need have no doubts," he said earnestly.  "I shall
accompany you, and you may hear my parting instructions to Flint.
Friend Peter, will you indulge me for the space of half an hour
whilst I visit the _Walrus_ with my nephew?"

"_Neen_," answered Peter, and pushed away from the table.  "I go too."

"No, no----"

"I go too."

"But naught was said of two hostages----"

"If Bob goes, I go," insisted the Dutchman.  "_Ja_."

Murray shook his head.

"For you I might not be responsible, Peter."

"I be responsible for myself," said Peter.  "I go to der _Walrus_ or
you go oudt der window."

My great-uncle stared at him for a moment, then burst into laughter.

"By gad, you would!  And after become captain in my place, no doubt.
You are unmatchable, Peter.  What do you say, nephew?"

"I'd not have Peter risk his throat with mine," I answered
uncomfortably, the words of Flint's song still ringing in my memory.

"I go wit' you, Bob," repeated the Dutchman.

"You see!" cried Murray.  "'Tis useless to object.  Go with you he
will.  Well, you'll have company at least--and I shall lack a
companion whose presence is not the less valuable for his silence.  A
good friend is Peter, Robert.  I would he were mine!"

Peter rose.

"We go," he said.  "_Ja_."

On deck Murray had the longboat called away, and we embarked in
silence.  'Twas a hot night, with very little air stirring, and the
ribald uproar on the _Walrus_ was amazingly distinct.  The _James_
was like a tomb by contrast.  Not a sound came from her, and the only
lights she showed were in the waist and the main cabin.  The _Walrus_
was a blaze of lanthorns from poop to fo'csle, but Murray hailed the
deck twice before he had an answer.

"Boat ahoy!" responded a husky voice then.  "Why'n ---- don't ye come
aboard?"

"'Tis Captain Murray to see Captain Flint," replied my great-uncle
calmly.

"Aye, aye, sir," answered the husky voice on a quaver of fear.
"We'll call him directly.  Will ye come aboard, sir?"

My great-uncle turned to Peter with one foot on the side ladder.

"Are you certain you must go with Robert?" he asked.  "I can assure
you no harm shall come to him."

"_Ja_, I go."

My great-uncle's reply was a shrug of indifference, and Peter and I
climbed after him to the deck.  The noise of revelry stopped dead as
he appeared, but the visible evidence of it was plain to see on every
hand.  A cask of rum with the head knocked out stood by the foot of
the mainmast.  There was a pool of blood on the deck-planking by the
fo'csle companionway, and a pallid-cheeked fellow was binding up his
arm in a dirty headcloth and spitting oaths at another man who
composedly wiped his knife clean on a frowsy coil of rope.  Fore and
aft men had been gaming, drinking, quarreling and singing--and all
abruptly halted whatever they were doing to stare at us.

Murray returned their stares with an undisguised repugnance which I
discovered myself to share.  The _Walrus_ was a revelation after the
ordered discipline of the _Royal James_.  In a word, she was
pig-dirty.  Her deck was littered with all kinds of rubbish; her
rigging was slack and spliced in a fashion which seemed lubberly to
me, who was a lubber; her canvas was torn, poorly patched and
wretchedly furled; boats, barrels, lumber, spare spars and cables lay
about in entire confusion.  The planks we trod on were slippery with
grease.  The paint was peeling from the bulwarks.  There were spots
of rust on the muzzle of a chase gun, which itself was hauled out of
its proper position.

Flint came swaggering down to us from the poop in a condition which
was in harmony with his surroundings.  Like most of his men, he had
discarded coat, shirt, stockings and shoes to accommodate himself to
the heat of a tropical Summer.  His loose canvas trousers, identical
with those the seamen wore, were streaked with dirt and tar.  His
bare calves and forearms were covered with dried blood where they had
been scratched by brambles in his shore expeditions; out of the
matted hair on his chest was thrust the head of a tiger, most
marvelously tattooed in black and yellow.  His hair was a lank frame
for his saturnine face, stubbly with a week's growth of beard.

Sure, the contrast was as sharp betwixt him and my great-uncle,
immaculate in figured black satin, hair sprucely dressed, as betwixt
the two ships.  He sensed it himself.

"What d'ye seek, Murray?" he growled.  "Come to look us over?"

"I am come to fulfil my contract with you," replied my great-uncle.
"I am sailing with the morning ebb, and I bring you, not one hostage,
but two."

Flint stepped closer and scrutinized Peter and me.

"Two, eh?  What do I want wi' two?  What good's this fat man to me?
He means nothing to you."

"On the contrary," denied my relative.  "Master Corlaer is an old and
valued enemy of mine, of whom I have hopes of making in time a
friend."

"Well, he's no good to me; gut me if he is!"

"You will take both or none," said my great-uncle in the voice like a
dripping icicle which he knew so well how to assume.

"Nasty, are ye?" rasped Flint.  "Blast ye for a ----"

A light in Murray's tawny eyes kindled like a flame under the
reflection of the battle-lanthorns which were hung from the lower
spars.

"Two it is," Flint ended hastily.  "But ye'll never see either one o'
'em if ye don't make good on your bargain.  I ha' supported much from
ye, Murray, but ----"

"You'll support more for sufficient gold," rebuked my great-uncle.
"Tut, man, I read you like a book.  When we first encountered you
were proud to be mate of a trading-brig.  I have put you in the way
to rank and fortune, if you know how to exploit your opportunities."

"Rank and opportunities!" jeered Flint with an ugly laugh.  "Aye, ye
took me when I was an honest young man and made a pirate o' me.  And
the only opportunity I'll win through you will be to kick the air in
Execution Dock."

My great-uncle helped himself to snuff, tapping his box as Flint
talked.

"Hark ye," he broke in when the _Walrus'_ captain had got so far, "I
am pressed for time.  I have but two things to say to you.  Guard
well and cherish carefully these two persons I commit to you, and in
two months I'll hand over to you three hundred and fifty thousand
pounds."

"You said seven hundred thousand," snapped Flint.

"I said seven hundred thousand to be divided betwixt the two ships."

"Oh-ho!  And ye'll take captain's share o' the _James'_ half, eh?  As
well as your hundred thousand slice?"

"My terms are perfectly clear," returned Murray.  "Now for my second
point.  When I return it may be we shall have need of swift keels.  I
recommend you to get your ship in decent condition.  As she stands,
you could be carried by a Portuguese slaver."

A shrewd look dawned in Flint's face.

"And where are ye a-goin' to pluck this million and a half o'
treasure from?" he demanded.  "You ha' said much of it, but you told
me little.  What course doth the treasure-ship sail?  Where do you
lurk for her?  There's wide seas betwixt the Main and the Atlantic,
and ye can't stop every hole, Murray."

"You may safely entrust that portion of the task to me," replied my
great-uncle drily.

He offered me his hand, and somewhat to my own surprize I found
myself inclined to accept it.

"Robert," he said, "I regret exceedingly the necessity I am under of
inflicting this unpleasantness upon you.  I shall endeavor to provide
you adequate reparation.  You also, friend Peter.  Remember, we are
working for a greater cause than our personal enrichment."

He vaulted lightly to the top of the bulwarks and dropped out of
sight on the farther side.  His shoes clicked on the ladder-cleats,
and we heard the rattle of oars as his boat put off.

"Gut me, but there's times I think he believes all he says," swore
Flint.




CHAPTER XI

PETER PLAYS AT BOWLS WITH DESTINY

Darby McGraw's red head shone in the lanthorn-light.

"Whisht, but it's Master Bob again!  Now ain't this the mighty
forchune to have ye with us!  Ha' ye left the old devil yon for good?"

He nodded his torch of hair at the vague hull of the _James_.  Flint
exploded with raucous laughter.

"'The old devil yon,'" he repeated.  "---- me, but it takes Darby to
put the right word to a man.  'Tis what he is, blast him for the ----
---- ---- he sets himself up to be!"

Darby proffered him a huge silver beaker of rum.

"I fetched this from the cabin after ye, captain," said the Irish boy
in his wheedling brogue.  "Troth, say I to meself, if the captain
must talk with Murray he'll ha' a bad taste in the mouth o' him to be
washed out, and I'd best ha' a sup o' sugar-juice handy for his
needin's."

Flint seized the rum, threw back his head and drained the fiery stuff
as if it had been wine.

"You said right, my lad," he answered sourly.  "And I'm thinking I'll
maybe need all the luck that red head o' yours can bring me.  Where's
Billy Bones?"

"Dhrunk under the cabin table," returned Darby promptly.

"Gut him for the souse he is!  And Long John?"

"Sure, captain dear, 'twas yourself sent him ashore to keep the lads
up to the fort from carvin' theirselves."

"So I did.  Well, I'll see to the prisoners myself then."

"Pris'ners!" protested Darby, wide-eyed.  "Troth, himself is the
nevvy or what-not o' the old devil.  For why'll ye be makin' him a
pris'ner?  More by token, he was me friend in New York, and Peter
too.  Grand pirates they'll be, if ye do but give 'em time."

"Prisoners I said, and prisoners they are!" glowered Flint.  "D'ye
know what a hostage is, Darby?"

"One that'll be by-ordinary wicked?" answered Darby.

"More'n likely," assented Flint with a pardonable chuckle.  "Well,
these is hostages, Darby.  Likewise prisoners."

"Och, captain, ye won't be hard on Master Bob!  He's as kindly a
young gentleman as ever I see--and Peter there is a grand fightin'
feller.  Ye should hear to tales they tell o' his murtherin' and
slayin' with the red Injuns."

"I'll be as hard as they make me be," returned Flint.  "But for
tonight I must have them safe."

Darby plucked at his sleeve.

"I'll say naught if ye must put Peter away--though a good friend I
ha' called him.  But be aisy wi' Master Bob and let me take him below
for a sup for old times' sake.  Troth, there's no harm in nature in
him.  And if he has a chance at education in the right way 'tis a
fine, brave pirate we'll make o' him that can fight two men at once
wi' knife and tomahawk."

Flint's eyes narrowed.

"Ho-ho!" he exclaimed.  "Is that the kind of cockerel ye are, Master
Ormerod or whatever ye may be called?  I'm main thankful for the
tip-off, Darby.  I knew Buckskin was dangerous, but I'd never ha'
been on my guard for the young 'un, except for you.  Gut me, if I
take chances wi' two such champions!"

I saw that Darby was doing more harm than good by his sponsoring of
me, so I spoke up for myself.

"You need not take what the boy says for truth," I said.  "He means
well, but----"

"And if I didn't see ye knock the hatchet from Tom Trumbull's hand
the while ye were fending Dick Varje's knife--and could easily ha'
stabbed him, fightin' earnest, as Peter said--may I be hornswoggled
for a lubber!" proclaimed Darby indignantly.

"That's enough for me," snarled Flint.  "No lies, if it please you,
my fine gentleman!  The time may come we'll put your boasts to----

"I have not boasted."

"Keep your tongue behind your teeth!  Hold still, the two o' ye, or
I'll give ye a bellyful o' pickling-brine."

He signaled up a dozen or so of the nearest of his men, all of whom
had been observing us with a mingling of interest and hostility.

"We'll put these knife-fighters in the lazaret for the night," he
announced.  "They're a desperate pair, and we'll watch 'em close
until they are under hatches."

"Oh, whirra, whirra!" sobbed Darby.  "Do but see what I did to ye
with my tongue that wags from the middle both ways!  Sure, captain
darlin', ye don't need to hold against Master Bob what I said.  All
he seeks is to be a grand, murtherin' pirate.  Troth, we talked o'
nothin' else in the old days."

"Don't be foolish, Darby," I said.

And to Flint, as the group closed around us--

"Captain Murray bade you----"

"I know, I know!" he interrupted impatiently.  "The treatment you
receive will be whatever you earn for yourselves.  I'm an easy
skipper, as any man aboard the _Walrus_ will tell ye, my lad.  But
you are my stakes in a rich venture, and I'll be ---- ---- if I take
any chance on losing ye or your fat friend as goes with you.  So stow
your gab, and come wi' me willingly, and no blows struck or feelings
injured.  Tomorrow the _James_ will ha' sailed, and then we'll deal a
new hand all around."

His narrow green eyes, squinting out on either side of his thin nose,
surveyed me with a kind of appraisal.

"I have an idea we may yet find interests in common," he concluded.
"But that's to be seen."

Peter, at my elbow, spoke for the first time.

"_Ja, ja_.  We go.  I hafe a wish to sleep."

"Sleep, is it?" jeered Flint.  "That ye shall, my hearty!  Come along
o' me."

He led us aft, the others following, Darby in the rear almost in
tears.  We entered the poop quarters, stumbling over empty bottles,
broken platters, discarded garments, boots, articles of equipment and
weapons.  At the end of a dark passage Flint unhooked a lanthorn from
a wall and one of his men heaved up a trapdoor.  Below was a pool of
shadows that scuttled and swayed as if to escape the feeble light.
There was an odor, also, none too pleasant.

I drew back.

"Certes, you could lodge us securely otherwhere than this," I
protested.

"No, no," answered Flint.  "There's not a door aboard hath a lock
would hold Darby, let alone you two.  I'm sorry for ye, lad, if it's
no fault o' yours that you're here; but for tonight at least you must
lie in the lazaret.  Come, come; don't make me use force.  Here, ye
shall ha' the lanthorn to keep the rats off, and in the morning we'll
manage different."

Peter pushed past me, and took the lanthorn from his hand.

"We go, _ja_," he squeaked.  "Come, Bob."

I followed him without another word, already wondering at his
extraordinary docility.

"Do ye see your way, my masters?" Flint called after us, mimicking
the servile tones of a tavernkeeper to the considerable amusement of
his body-guard.  "Mind the low roof, an' it please ye, sirs.  The
beds ha' not been aired, but then we had no expectation o' your
company."

A guffaw of rough merriment, pierced by Darby's Irish wail, and the
trapdoor crashed down.  A hasp clacked home in a bolt, and footsteps
thudded away.  I sat on the bottom-most step of the ladder and peered
hopelessly around me as Peter, swinging the lanthorn as high as the
low deck-room allowed, prowled around the limited area of our prison.

A black rat as large as a cat rushed across my feet.  Squeaks and
rustlings sounded in the corners.  There was the _lap-lap-lap_ of
water against the vessel's hull, the creak of the rudder and the
strange moaning noises which any ship emits, whether at anchor or
under way.

Peter returned to the ladder-foot, deposited the lanthorn on the
floor and plumped himself beside it.

"What you t'ink, Bob?" he said blandly.  "Do we stay or get oudt?"

I frowned at him.

"'Tis no joke," I snapped.  "I had reasons for----"

"_Ja_," he agreed.  "Der little gal."

The Dutchman said so little and revealed such scant interest in what
went on about him that he frequently surprized even those who knew
him best, as my father never tired of maintaining.  He had not
spoken, up to this evening, of Murray's plan to employ me as a
hostage to conciliate Flint.  He had never suggested that he would
accompany me.  He had never betrayed by any hint a supposition that I
might prefer to remain aboard the _Royal James_ during the cruise
after the treasure-ship.  But on all these points he had done
considerable thinking as he now proceeded to demonstrate.

"How did you know!" I exclaimed.

"I know," he replied with his simpering imitation of a laugh.  "You
t'ink der little gal is a good gal.  You t'ink it is not goodt dot
she be taken aboard der _James_.  You want to be there andt be sure
dot she is safe."

"'Tis true as gospel, Peter," I groaned.  "I hoped to the last this
ridiculous plan of Murray's would fall through in some manner, but
the man has a damnable determination."

"_Ja_," agreed Peter.  "I t'ink he takes der treasure-ship, Bob.
Dot's easy."

"Easy?  I see not how!"

"_Ja_, it is easy to take her.  But after comes his troubles.  Much
treasure is bad for pirates.  We hafe troubles after."

"'We!'  We won't be there.  Very likely we'll be dead, Peter, slain
in one of the _Walrus'_ knife frays."

"Suppose we get oudt tonight," answered Peter persuasively.  "Suppose
we get oudt and back to der _James_.  _Ja_?"

I looked around me skeptically at the heavy planking and stout
timbers of the sides and for'ard bulkhead.

"It can't be done.  'Twould take a week to break out of this--and the
_James_ will be sailing in five or six hours."

"_Neen_," said Peter.  "We get oudt--any time we get oudt."

"How?" I demanded.

He picked up the lanthorn and led me for'ard to the bulkhead.  The
light showed that one of the oaken planks was slightly sprung,
leaving an infinitesimal crack between its edge and the uppermost of
its fellows.

"Are you planning to pry that off with your fingernails?" I taunted
him.

"_Neen_," he answered, and conducted me to a corner whence the rats
scudded as we approached.

He stirred his foot amongst some rubbish and turned up several long,
wrought-iron spikes, such as are used to bolt together the heavier
ship-timbers.

"Dot's plenty," he said.

I could hardly control the gush of relief that welled up in me.

"I believe it is," I whispered.  "But, oh, Peter, there is such
little time!"

"Enough," he grunted.  "Come!  We begin."

We listened at the bulkhead for signs of life on the opposite side,
but not a sound came through to us, although the clamor on the upper
deck and in the poop cabin seeped into our dungeon from overhead.
'Twas stiflingly hot, and Peter's first care was to strip off his
buckskin shirt and leggings.

"We got to swim," he said, eying them regretfully.  "You don't need
clothes tonight, Bob."

So I followed his example, and we fell to work with our spikes upon
the sprung plank, the sweat pouring in rills of moisture from our
half-naked bodies, our crude tools slipping in our greasy fingers as
we pried and pushed and fought for every inch of space betwixt the
plank and the upright it was nailed to.  Peter did all the work.  It
was his tremendous muscles that fretted and teased the point of his
spike into the tiny gap that awaited us, that gradually enlarged the
advantage.  All I could do was to hold whatever space he won, giving
him opportunity to improve upon it until a smashing drive of his
great shoulder tore the plank loose at one end.

We waited, then, gasping for breath, wiping the sweat from our eyes,
fearful lest the wrench of the wood as it was ripped free should have
attracted the attention of some member of the crew.  But nobody
appeared, and the uproar on deck was audibly decreased.  Even the
crew of the _Walrus_ found occasion for sleep.

The most difficult portion of our task was immediately ahead.  We had
to pry loose now a plank which was nailed fast to the uprights, and
we dared not resort to the use of any substitute for a hammer because
of the noise.  'Twas necessary for Peter's fingers to force the point
of a spike between plank and upright and slowly wedge the two apart.
He did it, with the palm of his bare hand for a mallet, his muffled
grunts the only indication of the energy he expended.

But this was a matter of several hours, for I was less able to assist
than I had been before.  My puny strength was wholly inadequate to
the wrestle with seasoned wood and tempered iron which he must carry
on in cramped quarters and semidarkness.

As the last nail yielded to Peter's shoulder the thin clangor of the
bell of the _Royal James_ stole down to us out of the night.  Four
times it rang--two o'clock!  No answering strokes sounded on the deck
above us.  Ship routine was a thing of caprice aboard the _Walrus_.

"Get oudt, Bob," whispered Peter.

I wriggled through the gap in the bulkhead, and he passed the
lanthorn after me.  Its flame was burning low, but I had sufficient
light to determine that I stood in a stores-hold crammed with casks
of rum, salt meat and ship's biscuit.  A door in its for'ard bulkhead
led to another hold of the orlop deck, where were a hatch and ladder
leading up to the gundeck.  I crept as far as the foot of the ladder
and listened to the snores of the scores of men who slept in hammocks
slung between the great guns of the battery.  That way lay our only
path of escape.

I returned to Peter in a mood that was none too cheerful; but he was
already at work with his spike, hissing like a kettle on the boil as
he prodded away with its blunted point.  I was able to be of more
assistance to him this time, since from the farther side 'twas
possible to exert a greater leverage, once the plank was sprung
loose.  Yet the _James_ sounded seven bells before we were
successful.  Peter grunted his satisfaction.

"We got time," he said.  "Whoof!  So much I sweat I slide me t'rough
dot hole."

The lanthorn's flicker was little more than a pin-prick of flame in
the darkness of the ship's bowels, but I lighted my shirt from it and
held this aloft to help him see his way.  He was stripped to the
buff, and his pink, hairless body was all a-glisten as he rolled into
the opening.  His head and shoulders made it easily, but I saw with
dismay that his immense paunch was an insurmountable obstacle.  He
heaved and shoved and twisted.  'Twas no manner of use.  He could not
pass that gap without the removal of another plank, and there was not
time for that.  At any moment the _James_ would ring eight bells.
And at any moment then she would be under way.

Peter backed out of his predicament to an accompaniment of squeaking
grunts, and I followed him, too bitterly disappointed for words.
Escape had seemed so easy--and now we were condemned to two months
aboard the _Walrus_, very likely to exceedingly uncomfortable deaths,
for I fancied that Flint was the sort of man to lose his queer
mixture of fear and respect for my great-uncle as soon as they were
out of touch.

"Hold der light here, Bob," said Peter, squatting on the litter of
the deck, and he proceeded to extract a splinter from his foot.

"_Ja_, dot's goodt," he went on, standing up.  "Well, we don't get
oudt dot way."

"Are you sure we could not tear off another plank?" I answered.  "I
might find a hammer--or a chisel----"

"Andt der noise brings der watch!  _Neen_, we got a better chance."

"What, Peter?"

"You see!"

He felt his way toward the ladder to the cabin-hatch.

"Always there is another way, Bob.  If one way is not goodt, der
other maybe is better.  _Ja_!  You see."

He climbed the ladder silently in his bare feet until his great
shoulders were directly beneath the square of the hatch, and I heard
a faint grinding of straining metal, the crackling of tortured wood.

"_Ja_," he panted, desisting.  "We do dot.  Now you be ready, Bob.
Jump oop, quick.  Maybe we got to kill some fellers, andt if we do we
don't let them holler."

I could feel his legs quivering above me; the ladder itself vibrated
under us.  There was a whine, a sudden pop--and the hatch flew up in
the air.  Peter caught it on the flats of his hands before it could
settle again and lifted it back.  He was out in a flash, and I was
hard on his heels.

We crouched on the main-cabin floor, staring about us for a sign of
the pirates.  The lights had all burned out, and it was several
minutes before our eyes became adjusted to the star-shine that sifted
through the stern window.

A snore from the settee which ran along beneath the windows brought
both of us to our feet, and I bent over the table, fingers crooked,
to clutch the throat of whoever it might be.  But I was put to it not
to laugh aloud as I looked into the flushed face and open mouth of
Darby McGraw.  Poor Darby!  A little rum went a long way with him,
and he loved to ape his elders.

"'Drink an' the devil--done for th' rest,'" he hiccoughed in his
sleep.

"He's safe," I murmured.

"_Ja_," whispered Peter, and busied himself reshutting the trap-door
and arranging the bolt and hinges so as to conceal the fact of its
having been forced.

We tiptoed into the companionway, and a very cannonade of snores
assailed us from the staterooms on either hand.  The doors stood
open, and we looked in upon the prickly jowl of Flint, Bones' mottled
cheeks and two other drunken underlings.  Flint held a cocked pistol
in his right hand, which was flung across his chest.  Why he did not
shoot himself only an obscure Providence can explain.

At the exit to the deck we tarried to reconnoiter our situation, and
'twas lucky we did so.  Eight bells rang out from the _Royal James_,
and a voice most astonishingly close muttered a curse.

"Ye might think they 'ad a blarsted admiral aboard," answered a
second voice.

"I'll lay ye a castellano there was a whole watch awake on her the
night long," said the first speaker.

A whistle shrilled, and the gruff voice of Saunders reached us quite
distinctly ordering the topmen aloft.

"There they go, Jemmy," returned the second man.  "We'll be free o'
the swabs in another glass."

"And good riddance, says I," declared Jemmy, spitting into the
scuppers.

I saw where they were then, leaning against the starboard poop-ladder
and peering overside at the vague hull of the _James_.  Peter's
little eyes had identified them, too, and his fingers sank into the
flesh of my arm, signaling me to stay where I was.  He glided past me
on to the deck, his body ghostly in the gloom.

"I'm ---- if I can see as why we has to keep our peepers open,"
growled the second man.

"'Tain't long now till morning," replied Jemmy.  "What d'ye s'y to a
dash o' rum, matey?"

He half-turned, and saw Peter's enormous white bulk hovering over
him, and his teeth gleamed as he opened his mouth involuntarily to
scream.

"I don't care if--" the second man said.

The Dutchman leaped, and his two arms whipped out.  Jemmy's scream
died in a guttural cough.  Peter grappled the throat of each.  He
held them poised for a moment, then brought their heads together with
an odd hollow smack like the cracking of egg-shells.  They collapsed
inert on the deck.

I darted for the rail, but Peter stayed me.

"_Neen, neen,_" he objected.  "First I get me some pants, Bob.  Andt
we drop these fellers overboardt."

He was divesting the larger of the two of the single garment each one
wore the while he talked, and, conquering an instinctive sensation of
repugnance, I did likewise.

"Dot's better, _ja_," remarked Peter complacently.  "A little tight;
but I don't like it to be naked, Bob.  _Neen!_"

He rose to his feet, buckling the dead man's belt around him.

"They'll splash!" I warned him as he picked up the big one.

"Nobody hears," he answered.

He lowered the body over the rail feet first, and the splash was less
than I had expected.  The second body followed with equal expedition,
and Peter laid hold of one of several ropes that trailed untidily
over the _Walrus'_ side.

"Now we go, Bob," he said.

We entered the water almost together, and swam side by side down the
anchorage toward the _James_.  I realized at once that the tide had
turned, for the ebb sucked us along at a rate vastly swifter than we
could have achieved by our own unaided efforts, although Peter,
despite his discomfort at sea, was a remarkably powerful swimmer,
thanks to his lifetime in the wilderness country of the frontier.

"The tide will take care of the dead men," I panted, stroking for all
I was worth to keep pace with the Dutchman.

A whistle shrilled again aboard the _James_.

"_Ja_," said Peter.  "Der anchor goes oop, Bob.  We hurry!"

He was a dozen strokes ahead of me at the end.  I found him hanging
on to the heel of the rudder and calmly treading water.  For'ard the
capstan was clanking to a steady yo-ho-hoing and trampling of feet.
Yards were banging, sails were slatting, men were shouting and
calling.

"Anchor up-and-down, sir!" called Saunders.

My great-uncle's voice answered him.

"Very good!  We will weigh.  Oh, Master Martin, are you sure there is
no boat from the _Walrus_?  I could have sworn I heard the splash of
the falls."

"Aye, aye, sir," replied Martin.  "I'll be ---- ---- ---- ---- for a
---- ---- ---- if there is so much as a man awake aboard the ----
---- craft."

I looked up at the stern windows, so high above us.  From our
precarious perch on the rudder the _James_ towered like Spyglass
Mountain, touchable but unattainable.  Almost I could have cried out
to my great-uncle and hailed him to have us hauled aboard.  But
common sense warned me he would certainly seize upon the opportunity
to send us back to the _Walrus_ as clinching evidence of his good
faith.  And I had no desire to face Flint with those two dead men to
account for.

"What's to do?" I whispered to Peter, whose eyes were roving over the
lofty stern.  "We can not bide here.  Once she has way on her, we'll
be tossed off."

"_Ja_," agreed Peter.  "You see dot shiny picture oop there?"

He indicated a golden sunburst, carved across the stern beneath the
cabin windows.  'Twas a minor tragedy in my great-uncle's life that
he was without the gold-leaf to make this part of his ship as
immaculate as the rest.  The constant battering of following seas had
cracked and diminished the gilding, but the ridges and niches of the
carving were still visible.

"Yes," I answered, puzzled.

"I climb oop on der rudder, andt I holdt me on to der roundness in
der middle.  Andt you climb oop on my shoulders andt into der cabin
windows, _ja_."

"You can't hold me up in that position, Peter!" I exclaimed.
"'Twould be all you could do to maintain yourself."

"I do it, _ja_," insisted Peter.

"But you?  How will you----"

"You t'row me a rope."

He scrambled on to the rudder and slowly spread-eagled himself upward
against the scrollwork which covered the stern.  His hands, feeling
blindly above his head, sought for and found a deep indentation in
the rays below the center of the sunburst, and with this to cling to,
he climbed a foot or two higher on to a shallow ridge which ran
across the stern, a shelf scarce wide enough to give him toehold.
His grip shifted with lightning precision, his fingers clamping
themselves about the embossed figure of the sun, deeply carven for
relief.

"Now you climb, Bob," he grunted.

I obeyed him without objection, for every breath was precious and the
_James_ was already adrift, her anchor merely a pendulous weight
for'ard.

The rudder I surmounted with ease, standing erect with a hand on one
of Peter's legs to steady me.  I stepped up to the ridge upon which
the Dutchman stood with no more difficulty, holding to his leather
belt.  Then I changed my hand-hold to a ridge in the carving, and by
his direction braced the toes of one foot in the slack of his belt as
I heaved myself upward.  Peter grunted.  That was all.

I found a new hand-hold and brought my other foot up on to Peter's
shoulder and stood erect there.  Reaching upward now, better than two
tall men's height above the waterline, my groping finger-tips were
still below the level of the stern windows.  Peter sensed my
difficulty.

"On my headt," he grunted.

I carefully lifted one foot, selected another hand-grip and mounted
Peter's tow locks.  Again I explored upward with one arm stretched to
the limit of safety, but I failed by inches to clutch the sill of the
stern windows.

"Jump," sobbed Peter.

"But you!"

"Jump!"

The rudder clacked as it was put over, and the _James_ heeled
slightly to the breeze.  The water commenced to purr as she gathered
way.

I jumped.  Peter sagged beneath me, but the fingers of my right hand
fastened upon the ledge of the window.  I heard a splash, and caught
hold with my left hand.

"Ooop!" spluttered Peter from the water.

The rest was child's play compared to what had preceded it.  The
carving afforded toe-holds in plenty, and soon I had a leg over the
windowsill and looked down at Peter trailing in the _James'_ wake as
he clung to the shelf which crossed the stern perhaps a foot above
the water.  He dared no longer hold to the rudder.

His big face was so white that it frightened me, and I tumbled
inboard without stopping to make sure the cabin was empty.  But my
luck was with me, and I scurried around to find a rope.  This was a
hopeless quest in that luxurious apartment, so I ran up the
companionway and just inside the door to the deck came upon a lead
line, coiled and hung to a hook, which I appropriated.

Altogether these movements consumed less time than is required to
describe them; but when I returned to the stern windows Peter was
gone.  I leaned out and stared back at the _James'_ creaming
wake--and a white arm flashed in a gesture of appeal twenty feet
astern.  I cast the lead behind him, and he caught the line as it
settled into the water, cut the lead free with the dead man's knife
at his belt, looped the slack under his shoulders, and with my
feverish help hauled himself back to the shelf above the water line.

I lacked the strength to draw him up; but I fastened my end of the
line to the cabin table, which was bolted to the floor, and then,
foot by foot, Peter toiled upward.  He was so weary at the last that
I must pull him through the window, and he fell in a heap across the
table, puddling the polished surface with the sea-water that streamed
off him and the blood from his scarred hands.

A bottle of the _aqua vitae_ my great-uncle favored stood by his
place, and I took this and poured a liberal tot between Peter's lips.
He staggered to his feet, blinking his eyes and red as a school miss.

"All right, Bob," he squeaked.  "I be all right, _ja_."

His eyes chanced upon the lead-line, still fast to the table's leg,
and he stooped and unknotted it and dropped it out of the window.

"We better not stay here," he muttered.  "_Neen_!  If Murray sees
us----"

"Oh, my Gawd!"

Ben Gunn goggled at us from the companionway.

"Drowned, they be!" he gasped to himself.  "He done for 'em, Flint
did!"

I was afraid he would run out on deck and cry an alarm, and I started
for him to prevent this.  But the poor creature was fettered by
superstitious fear.

"Dear Christ!" he mumbled.  "It's a-comin' for me.  Oh, sweet Lord,
don't 'ee let the ghostie take Ben Gunn.  Don't 'ee, now!  A good,
pious lad I was, as went to church reg'lar and said my catechism, and
if my old mother could----"

"Be still, Ben," I said.  "We don't mean to hurt you."

He plucked up a little courage when I spoke.

"'Tain't right for ye to talk," he objected.  "I never heard tell as
how sperets----"

"We're not spirits," I answered.  "We are as alive as you are.  Here,
feel this."

He shrank back as I placed my clammy, wet hand upon his neck, but the
touch reassured him.

"Ye ain't sperets, says you," he repeated amazedly.  "Nor ye ain't
ghosts.  And consekently ye ain't dead.  And seein' as you're here,
why, it do stand to reason as how ye ain't aboard the _Walrus_, which
is where ye was and where ye oughter be."

He shook his head.

"'Tain't right, Master Ormerod, and don't follow in nature nohow."

"'Tis perfectly natural," I retorted.  "Master Corlaer and I have
escaped from the _Walrus_."

Ben came a step or two into the cabin and stared hard at Peter.  Then
he turned a disapproving eye upon the pools of water we had sprinkled
on the table and the rich carpet.

"Well, it do look to be 'ee two," he conceded grudgingly.  "But ye
ha' mucked up the cabin awful, and the captain will be like to ha' me
triced to the main for a round dozen wi' the cat."

"Not if you work quickly with a bucket and mop, Ben," I said, for I
was as anxious as himself to conceal the traces of our entrance from
Murray.

"Maybe so," he agreed.  "But he won't like it that ye come aboard
this way."

I seized upon his opening without scruple.

"Yes, he'll hold it against you, Ben.  'Tis a shame."

He shivered, and I appreciated what my great-uncle's wrath must be.

"Ye wouldn't let him now!  Master Ormerod!  Oh, say ye wouldn't!  Ye
don't want poor Ben Gunn to be screamin' on the triangle."

"That I don't," I assented warmly.  "You must hide us, Ben.  Hide us
and clean up the cabin, and he'll never know we are aboard."

"Aye, but then?" he asked shrewdly.

"Oh, then 'twill not matter.  Nobody will know that you had aught to
do with our coming aboard; and indeed Captain Murray will not care, I
think.  'Twas not of his own will he gave us to Flint."

"If 'tis so, why don't 'ee go up on the poop and tell the captain
now?"

"He'd have to send us back to Captain Flint.  You wouldn't like to be
sent aboard the _Walrus_ to stay, Ben."

Ben Gunn cocked his head on one side.

"I ain't so sure," he answered.  "Maybe Flint would let me wear
seaman's gear and tar my hair."

Despite the urgency of our plight I was interested in the humor of
the steward's ambition.

"Aren't you satisfied with your lot?" I inquired.

"Not I!" he replied with unexpected determination.  "Look 'ee, Master
Ormerod, I went to sea for to be a swearin', cutlass-lashin' pirate,
and they put me in a livery-shuit!  All my life I been wearin' livery
o' one kind or another.  Now if you, or Cap'n Flint, we'll say, was
to hail Ben Gunn and argyfy as how ye'd take him out o' livery--never
a livery-shuit again--and make him a reg'lar sailorman as pulls on
ropes and climbs masts and holds a wheel and swabs decks--if you was
to do all this, why, maybe Ben Gunn, he'd do 'most anything for
you--or Cap'n Flint, if so be as Flint spoke fust."

"'Tis I speak first," I replied.  "If I ever command a ship you shall
be a tarry sailorman aboard her, Ben.  Or if I don't have a ship of
my own I'll help you to a berth on another such as you desire."

He came close to me, and his eyes bored into mine with an earnestness
that was pathetic.

"That's a solemn-honest promise, ain't it, Master Ormerod?  Ye
wouldn't go for to fool Ben Gunn, would 'ee, now?"

"No, no," I promised.  "But if you don't hide us quickly, Ben, I'll
never be able to make good on it."

He caught my hand in his.

"You jes come along o' me.  Ben Gunn knows a thing or two, he does.
I'll show 'ee, my master.  You jest come along o' me."

Peter and I sopped after him up the companionway to a door for'ard of
the staterooms we occupied, which led by way of a steep flight of
ladder-stairs to the galley and service quarters, a space partitioned
off from the vast sweep of the gundeck.  Ben unhooked a lanthorn from
the wall, opened a trap in the deck and signed us to follow him.  At
the bottom of a second ladder we found ourselves in a lazaret such as
had been our prison aboard the _Walrus_.  But there was this
difference in our surroundings: That they were clean.  The walls were
whitewashed, and around them were ranged kegs and pipes of wines, ale
and rum, and racks laden with bottles of various liquors.

"'Tis Murray's wine-cellar," I commented aloud.

Ben Gunn deposited the lanthorn in the middle of the floor and
approached his mouth to my ear.

"Aye, and he keeps his treasure 'ere--when so be he has any," he
whispered throatily.

"Doth he never come here?"

"Not he.  Nor the naygurs, neither.  Only Ben Gunn."

"What shall we do for food?"

Ben wiggled with embarrassment.

"Jest you leave that to Ben Gunn.  He'll feed ye well, my master, as
spoke kind to him and promises to take him out o' livery-shuits.
Aye, that he will.  And fetch ye clothes from the cabin.  But don't
'ee forget the promise, sir.  Oh, say ye won't!"

"I won't," I assured him.  "But you must get back to the cabin and
tidy up the mess we made.  Haste, man!"

He scampered up the ladder as if the devil were after him--or
Paradise within view.

And during the two days of our stay in the wine-cellar of the _Royal
James_ he was as good as his word.  He fed us well.  He brought me a
sufficiency of clothing.  And he procured for Peter a quantity of
linen and cotton cloth, with thread and needles, with which the
Dutchman fashioned himself garments to cover his inconveniently large
body.

On the evening of the second day, having learned from Ben that the
_James_ had logged several hundred knots since leaving the
Rendezvous, we decided 'twould be safe to appear before Murray, and
we took an opportunity whilst Ben was serving his dinner to ascend
through the galley and present ourselves in the main cabin.

My great-uncle was poring over the chart of the Caribbean which so
frequently engaged his attention, but he glanced up as he heard the
shuffling of our feet on the carpet.  A furrow of perplexity was dug
betwixt his eyes.  Otherwise he revealed no astonishment.

"So!  You two have taken matters into your own hands!  Did you by any
chance slay Flint?"

"We might have," I answered.  "But we did not."

"A pity in the circumstances," he ruminated.  "'Ods-blood!  Here is a
pretty coil!  Peter, I'll wager I have you to thank for it."

"_Ja_," said Peter, and sat himself in his accustomed place at the
table.

"'Tis true," I agreed, "that without Peter we might not have escaped,
but the responsibility is equally mine."

"How did you compass it?"

I told him, and he stared curiously at Peter, placidly eating across
the table from him.

"I might have known it, Peter.  No man ever held you in constraint
against your will.  I might have known it.  What a mess!  My plans
and combinations all askew!  Peter, y' have played at bowls with
destiny!  A half-hour since I saw my way clear.  Now I must plot it
fresh.  Stap me, what a coil!"

He rose and started to walk the cabin, hands clasped behind him, head
on his chest.  Suddenly he paused in front of me.

"What moved you to such a desperate course, Robert?"

His tawny eyes glowed with the light of inner speculation..

"Was it to be with me?  Or was it O'Donnell's lass?"

I hesitated, frankly loath to hurt him.

"I was concerned for her," I admitted finally.  "This ship is no fit
place for a maid, as I have said before."

"'Tis better than some," he answered.

But my reply did not seem to annoy him.  His gaze dwelt upon my face
for several moments longer.

"Well, well," he said as he began to pace the carpet again..  "We
must make the best of it, lad."




CHAPTER XII

THE TREASURE SHIP

There was no hint of triumph in my great-uncle's manner as the sloop
came about and lay to under our lee quarter; nor did he exhibit
excitement when she unloosed the small boat she towed astern and a
half-dozen swarthy fellows commenced to pull it toward us.  He
indulged in a pinch of snuff and took his station by the starboard
rail at the break of the poop.  Peter and I followed him.  Besides us
there was only Martin, who stood aft by the man at the wheel.
For'ard on the spar-deck men slouched away from the starboard
bulwarks as Murray appeared.  The gunports were all closed because of
the swell which rolled the _Royal James_ until it seemed she must dip
her yard-arms under.  So I think--aside from the lookouts lashed in
the crosstrees of all three masts--we on the poop were the only ones
who watched the little boat come sliding across the great, heaving
mountains of water that surged out of the misty reaches of the
Caribbean as if they would overflow the shores of Hispaniola, which
loomed purple in the north beyond leagues of indigo sea.

The rowboat was as infinitesimal as an insect in those tossing
wastes; but the man at the steering-oar guided it with uncanny skill,
up the toppling crests that threatened to crush it, down the dizzy
steeps that bade fair to hurl it to the ocean's oozy bottom, and
brought it to rest a scant fifty feet from the _James'_ hull, his
long sweep fending and twisting to maintain the position.  He was
very dark and lean, with bare, corded limbs and a sinewy trunk
covered by the remnants of a cotton shirt and trousers.  His hair was
a stringy black.  His voice, when he spoke in answer to a sign from
my great-uncle, was harshly rhythmical, but what he said I could not
understand, for both he and Murray used Spanish.

My great-uncle asked two questions, both brief, and he answered as
briefly.  My great-uncle waved his hand again; he dug his
steering-oar into the crest of one of the monstrous surges, and the
little boat shot away like a roundshot from a gun.  A few moments
later we saw them make fast to the sloop and leap aboard, one by one.
The sloop hauled her wind and beat off to westward in long, slanting
tacks, and the _James_ was once more alone in the western mouth of
the Mona Passage, Hispaniola a blur in the north and Porto Rico
somewhere out of sight southeast of us.

Murray dusted a second pinch of snuff into his nostrils as he turned
from the rail.

"Our three weeks' waiting hath not been in vain," he said.  "The
_Santissima Trinidad_ was to sail from Porto Bello within the
forty-eight hours after Diego put forth.  She will be up with us in
another five days--before the week is over at the latest."

I was conscious of a conflict of emotions.

"She may slip by you.  'Tis a wide gut--and what's to do if she comes
in the night?"

"She can not slip by," returned my great-uncle.  "For all the leagues
of channel and the darkness of the nights, she can not slip by,
Robert.  The fools have delivered her into our hands.  By her
sailing-orders, so Diego told me, she must hug the south shore of
Hispaniola, that she may be within easy run of Santo Domingo in case
of accident.  As for the nights, she'll be lighted up like
Bartholomew's Fair."

"_Ja_, it's all right if dot Englishman we sighted last week don't
find a frigate," said Peter.

Murray's face fell a trifle.

"Yes, we have always that to reckon with," he acknowledged.  "Stap
me, I see not what the fellow could have suspected to send him kiting
from us.  But with any luck he'll not flush a frigate this side of
Jamaica, and that should give us time."

"If he suspected us, why not some of the other craft that have passed
us on our beat?" I interjected.  "There ha' been plenty."

My great-uncle pointed to the white ensign floating from the
mizzen-truck.

"They were all Spaniards or Frenchmen," he answered.  "They took us
for a King's ship.  No, there's little chance of interference.  If
there is--" his jaw squared--"I'll hunt the _Santissima Trinidad_
into Cadiz port."

He broke off abruptly.

"Master Martin!"

"Aye, aye, sir," responded the mate, stepping for'ard from the wheel.

"I would have all lookouts notified that I shall give ten onzas to
him who first hails the deck for a large Spaniard of forty-four guns
coming from the west.  She'll show a red-and-yellow light o' nights
at her fore-peak.  You will also see that all men sent aloft carry
night-glasses."

Martin touched his forelock.

"Aye, aye, sir!  I'll pipeclay the ---- ---- ---- who misses the ----
dago.  Curse me for a lubber, but I knew there must be fat game
a-comin' after such a spell o' idleness."

"She'll be the fattest prize we have ever boarded," rejoined Murray.
"You may tell all hands as much."

There was no formal mustering of the _James'_ crew; but Martin
evidently had his own means of circulating information, for the
polyglot seamen had shaken off their lethargy and sullen quiet within
a glass of the sloop's departure.  All around the decks men were
oiling pistols, sharpening cutlasses and whispering in secret.
Coupeau was busier than ever about the battery, testing breech-ropes,
pinning tighter carriage-wheels, filing glassy-smooth a pile of shot
for the chase-guns that might be called upon to lop a vital spar at
extreme range.

But nothing happened that day or the next.  And so three more days
passed with increasing tension.  The lookouts in the crosstrees were
relieved every two hours, that the men's vision might be fresh and
unstrained.  The sight of a sail anywhere on the horizon sent the
crew scampering to the guns and swung the ship's bows in that
quarter; and four times in those five days the _James_ boomed down
upon Spanish fishermen, a Martinico brig, a Yankee schooner and a
Plymouth snow, tacking away again the moment she identified each one
as impossible to be her prey.

The sixth day was like its predecessors, blazing hot, bubbling the
pitch out of the deck-seams, a gentle sou'east breeze barely
sufficient to keep the sails drawing.  The swell, which had bothered
us for several weeks, had almost disappeared, and the Caribbean might
have been a land-locked lake.  Daylight found us farther to the south
than we usually plied, since Murray feared the Spaniard might have
missed his reckoning and shifted the designed course he was to follow.

For the first time in days we could descry the shadowy hills of Porto
Rico as we wore around and beat north again.  As the sun rose higher
a haze danced along the horizon's rim.  Porto Rico was swallowed up;
Hispaniola's soaring peaks were buried before we had come within
normal view of them.

Noon observation saw us returned to our customary station, and to
guard against the possibility that the _Santissima Trinidad_ had
passed us in the heat-haze whilst we were beating up from the south
my great-uncle ran down the wind into the mouth of the passage for
several glasses.  We encountered a fishing-periagua then, and the
Indians of its crew shouted back to Murray's question that no great
ship had entered the passage that day.  So back again we beat to
windward the whole weary afternoon.

Night brought rest to nobody.  Even my great-uncle paced the poop by
the hour, snatching an occasional nap upon a pallet which Ben Gunn
laid for him where it would catch the breeze.  Peter and I dozed on
the deck-planks with the crew.

In the shadowy hour that precedes the dawn the hail came from the
mast-head----

"Lights ho!"

Murray was on his feet as quickly as any of us.

"How do you make them?" he trumpeted.

"Red and yellow, over and under," answered the main crosstrees.

"Very good," replied my great-uncle.  "Master Martin, you will single
out that man and present him this purse."

He handed it over.

"Pipe all hands to breakfast, and serve an extra ration of rum."

"Aye, aye, sir," sighed Martin.  "And here's to luck, ---- my eyes!"

The dawn came all at once, as if a magician had waved his wand.  A
crimson glow in the east, soft at first, then spreading and
deepening, and the light expanded almost like an explosion in the
night.  The red disk of the sun lifted over the horizon.  And it was
day.  Westward, perhaps half a league, a great ship was wallowing
toward us before the freshening wind.  The coloring of her figurehead
sparkled in the level rays which touched her dingy canvas and turned
the sails to cloth-of-gold.  The gaudy banner of Spain flapped with a
splendid insolence in the pure light.  The spray which was tossed
over her bowsprit as she buried her stem in the easy swell was
transformed into threaded amethysts, turquoises, emeralds!

"She is heavy-laden!" exclaimed my great-uncle, staring at her
through his prospect-glass.

"Heavy-armed too," I added, pointing at the band of cannon along her
sides.

"We'll make light of that," he answered.  "But I shall have to pay
somewhat for my Quixotic promise to you, Robert, to spare her crew.
Ho, Coupeau!" he hailed the gunner who was passing on the spardeck.

The former galley-slave turned his terrible face to the poop and
saluted.

"Pass the word, Coupeau, that the prize must not be pierced betwixt
wind and water.  I would bring down a spar or two at the beginning of
the action, but concentrate your fire upon her decks."

"_Oui, m'sieu'_."

"But what of O'Donnell and his daughter!" I exclaimed.  "On a
shot-swept deck!"

My great-uncle regarded me curiously.

"'Tis not a game of lawn bowls we are about to play, Robert," he
replied.  "I ask you to remember that the Spaniard carries forty-four
cannon which he will discharge against us, with some probability of
slaying certain of our people, including perhaps ourselves."

"But the girl!"

He took snuff.

"Tut, tut, my boy!  You concern yourself needlessly.  'Tis a risky
business and can not be otherwise.  Yet she'll probably come safe
through it.  What part do you and Peter purpose to play in the
action?"

I was about to answer hotly that we would have naught to do with
piracy when Peter said--

"Maybe we better go aboardt der Spaniard and catch der little gal,
_ja_."

"An excellent idea," returned my great-uncle, looking expectantly at
me.  "I shall lead the boarders myself, and in the confusion I may be
hard put to it, single-handed, to direct the fighting and save the
O'Donnells from injury.  If you two----"

"We'll do it," I said ungraciously.  "'Tis of a parcel with your
crazy notions that you can not even safeguard your accomplice without
aid."

"That is quite true," he agreed mildly.  "I am free to admit, Robert,
your presence takes a load off my mind, notwithstanding your escape
from Flint hath created other difficulties for me to contend with.
However, I shall be sufficiently grateful to you if you will assist
me.  My notions, whether 'crazy' or not, are not easily carried into
execution."

I nodded to the white ensign at the main peak.

"Will you fight under false colors?"

"They are not false," he retorted with tightened lips.  "We fight for
England today."

"England and Flint and Long John Silver and Bill Bones and Martin and
Coupeau and----"

"Myself?  Perhaps.  But if those you have named share in the rewards
of victory 'tis that England may profit thereby and the Good Cause
triumph.  What doth it matter if King James return to London?"

"What indeed?" I echoed sarcastically, yet impressed against my will
by his deadly earnestness.

"'Tis not my way, Robert, to fight under false colors," he proceeded,
as if determined to argue me over to his view-point.  "Any sailorman
will tell you that, whatever other slander he may relate of Captain
Rip-Rap.  As for the Jolly Roger--pho!  'Tis a tradition required by
any pirate crew.  I look upon it as a somewhat humorous attempt to
terrify the timid; but I ha' fought under it without shame, since
'tis the only emblem of the sea outlaw.  But today 'tis different.
We fight, not as pirates, but as servants of King James."

A white puff of smoke jetted from our fo'csle, and a crackling
explosion smote our ears.  Coupeau had fired the first shot from one
of the chase guns, long eighteens, beautiful bronze pieces of
prodigious range.  Involuntarily we all focused our eyes upon the
treasure-ship, and a cheer from the gun-crews applauded the flapping
rent that showed in the bulge of the Spaniard's foretops'l.

"Excellent!" murmured my great-uncle.

The _Santissima Trinidad_ staggered for an instant like a man who has
been struck unexpectedly by one he supposed to be a friend.  Then she
yawed to give us a full view of her colors; and as she yawed,
broadening the target, Coupeau fired again.  'Twas a low shot, fired
as the _James_ dropped into the trough betwixt two waves, and all we
could see of it was that apparently it plowed into the waist.

The Spaniard fired a gun to leeward and put over his helm, aiming to
cross our bows and head up for Santo Domingo.  Plainly he did not
know what to make of the incident.  To all appearances the _Royal
James_ was a King's ship.  She showed the English naval ensign.  To a
Spanish eye, at any rate, she might well seem to possess the solidly
rakish aspect which was the usual keynote of an English frigate.  So
he evidently decided that hostilities must have broken out between
the two countries, and in obedience to his sailing-orders endeavored
to avoid a fight and make for the nearest fortified Spanish port.

But the _James_ sailed two feet to the treasure-ship's one; and,
splendidly handled, we overhauled her within a glass of the first
shot.  In the meantime Coupeau kept pecking away at her, and as we
came within range of our main battery her foretopmast crashed,
covering her fo'csle with a tangle of top-hamper.

This was too much for her people, and she put up her helm, brought
her entire battery to bear and let fly at us with all her starboard
metal.  'Twas a poorly managed salvo, yet three or four round-shot
swished across our decks, and an eighteen-pounder smashed a couple of
men to jelly just for'ard of the poop.

Murray stepped to the poop-rail to examine the damage and shouted to
Coupeau:

"Hold your broadside, Master Gunner!  He must come to to clear his
decks."

And to Martin, who was conning the ship:

"Bear up!  Bear up!  He still hath the weather gage of us."

Coupeau, working like a madman with his chase guns, was firing both
together, laid on the same target, and now he succeeded in cutting
down the foremast about twenty feet from the deck, sending the heavy
spar and billowing canvas a-tumbling after the fallen topmast.  The
bulk of the wreckage fell overside, dragging the _Santissima
Trinidad_ down by the head and forming a sea-anchor to hold her
stationary.

My great-uncle smiled with grim satisfaction.

"Ho, Saunders!" he hailed the second mate, who was stationed
amidships.  "Rig grappling-irons on the larboard bulwarks.  We'll
round the Spaniard as he lies."

The _Royal James_ forged abeam of the treasure-ship, approaching at
an angle which diminished the effectiveness of her second broadside,
and as we entered the filmy cloud-bank of smoke from her guns Murray
gave the order to fire.

"Let go your broadside, Coupeau!" he called.

The gunner ran to the open main-hatch and bellowed the order down to
the gun-deck.  The planks seemed to spring under our feet.  A
thunderous series of detonations shook the _James'_ whole fabric.
The smoke-clouds were first driven away, then thickened to an
impalpable mist, and the acrid stench of saltpeter and brimstone was
choking in the nostrils.  I had a wavery glimpse of a vast gilded
figurehead, a heap of torn canvas and rigging.

"Sta'b'd your helm, Master Martin!" shouted Murray.

We headed up into the wind with much creaking of yards and slatting
of sails, and I heard faintly a clamor of wailing outcries from the
smoke-bank that masked the _Santissima Trinidad_.  Almost at once our
broadside roared again, the red flames from the gun-muzzles licking
out like hungry tongues.  Another dim vision of shot-rent bulwarks
and towering sails, and the gray gloom became denser than ever.
Figures on our own deck were indistinct in it.

The Spaniard blindly returned our fire as the _James_ felt her way
toward him, the thunder of the two broadsides overpowering, numbing,
like the roaring of two beasts fighting in the night.  I felt my
great-uncle's hand on my arm; his voice was low, but distinct.

"We shall soon be broadside on with her," he said.  "The O'Donnells
will be on the poop.  You had best get for'ard, Robert.  If we board
from abaft the foremast 'twill place you strategically to seize upon
them.  Where is Peter?"

The Dutchman leaned through the smoke-whorls.

"We better go aboardt der Spaniard, _ja_, Murray?" he answered calmly.

My great-uncle chuckled as he dusted snuff into his nostrils.

"We had, friend Peter.  And you and Robert had best carry arms.  I
fear the Spaniards will not seek to differentiate betwixt you and my
wicked self."

"_Ja_," assented Peter.  "We go."

Amidships we encountered Saunders and a horde of men pouring up from
the gun-deck to augment the boarding-parties.  Peter and I tarried to
select weapons from a rack by the main mast.  He took a
boarding-pike, and I contented myself with a cutlass.

Murray, having inspected the grapplings and ascertained that hooks
had been rigged from our yard-arms to clutch the Spaniard's rigging,
rejoined us.  He was dressed with his usual exquisite taste in
watered gray silk, with white silk stockings and gray shoes with
jeweled buckles.  He wore no hat, and his white hair was clubbed and
cued.  The only weapon he carried was a dress-sword, which he held
unsheathed.

"An end to our immediate worries soon, Robert," he announced
cheerfully.  "The action has gone perfectly.  I would not have varied
a move so far.  We have not lost a dozen men."

A final blast from our guns tore the smoke-clouds to shreds, and a
vagrant wind-puff snatched them aside.  'Twas like the drawing of the
curtain at a play.  The treasure-ship lurched helplessly not twenty
fathoms distant, her rigging in tatters, her spars split and wounded,
her fo'csle and foredeck one red litter, her bulwarks splintered,
gunports blown in, guns dismounted.  A handful of men were laboring
to cut loose the wreck of the fore-mast, and a few other brave
fellows were still fighting a couple of guns which raked us as the
bowsprit of the _James_ nudged over her rail.

The two ships jolted together, and in response to wind and helm the
_Royal James_ swung broadside on against the Spaniard, our bowsprit
becoming entangled in her mizzen rigging.  A dozen grappling-irons
clattered in air and ground their hooks into her bulwarks.  There was
a brisk popping of small-arms, an exchange of threats and shouts of
defiance.

My great-uncle, regardless of the firing, mounted the breach of a
cannon which elevated him above the bulwarks, and Peter and I climbed
into the forerigging, whence we had a fair view of both decks.  The
larboard bulwarks of the _Royal James_ were crowded with men.
Stripped to the waist, their lowering faces smutted with
powder-stains, their hairy chests barred with tattooing, their backs
more often than not scarred by the cruel welts of the lash, they
tussled for first place and clung with their bare toes wherever there
was a bit of running gear or an inch of space, gripping cutlasses in
their teeth to leave hands free for pistol work or to steady
themselves as they waited an opportunity to leap the narrowing gap
between the vessels.

My eyes strayed to the Spaniard's decks.  Little knots of men ran
about confusedly.  A stolid-looking fellow aimed a pistol at me, and
a ratline over my head fell apart.  Officers were driving the sailors
forward to meet us.  A man in a laced coat and periwig was shouting
orders from the poop, and my pulse quickened, for at his shoulder was
the lanthorn-jawed face of Colonel O'Donnell--aye, and in rear of
both a skirt fluttered in the midst of a huddle of raven-black
figures, priests and nuns.

"Jump!" squeaked Peter in my ear.

We jumped together, but my great-uncle was ahead of us.  He leaped
all of ten feet, sword in hand, alighted on the Spaniard's bulwarks,
poised himself a moment and dropped into the center of a ring of
foes.  Before he had recovered his balance he parried the slash of a
cutlass and pinked an antagonist in the throat.  And he beat down a
leveled pistol as I gained the treasure-ship's deck, inclined his
head to avoid a murderous blow, ran the man through and almost in the
same breath stepped a pace to the right to engage a fourth
opponent--and all this with the cool precision of a fencing-master,
unhurried, a flush of obvious enjoyment on his pallid cheeks.

But I saw no more.  My task was to fight my way aft and protect the
O'Donnells, and Peter and I turned our backs upon the struggle
amidships.  One wave of the pirates stormed in Murray's wake; the
rest followed Peter and me.  They were as brave as they were vicious,
and we made rapid progress and were nearly at the foot of the
poop-ladder when Murray's whistle shrilled behind us.  I realized too
that both O'Donnell and the officer in the laced coat were shouting
volubly, the one in English and the other in Spanish, trying to make
themselves heard above the din.

"--asks parley," came in broken phrases from O'Donnell.  "--can not
understand--regrettable mistake----"

"Der Spaniard wants quarter," grunted Peter.

Indeed, those of the _Santissima Trinidad's_ men who had been
resisting us promptly flung down their arms, glad of the excuse to
quit the fight; but the wolves of the _James'_ crew were not schooled
to show mercy, and they killed three poor fellows before Peter and I
could knock up their cutlasses.

Murray's whistle blew a second time.  There was a sudden hush,
punctuated by the grinding of the two vessels, the thudding of unshod
feet as more of the _James'_ pirates dropped aboard the
treasure-ship, the gagging cries of the wounded, the nasal singsong
of a priest pattering Latin prayers.

I seized the opportunity to look around.  We were too close under the
poop to see what went on beyond the rail directly overhead; but the
maindeck, fore and aft, was a pitiful spectacle--cluttered with
wreckage and dead men and bits of men and men wounded in every
conceivable fashion, its yellow-sand carpet gemmed with carmine pools
and rivulets.

My great-uncle, as immaculate as when he had ascended the _James'_
bulwarks, stood a little ahead of the mass of his followers, his
serene face and rich clothing in startling contrast with their
nakedness and frank brutality.  A trickle of blood dripped from the
point of his slender sword.  His attitude was that of an honorable
man who wishes to be reasonable in a difficult situation.

"I believe I heard an appeal for quarter," he said quietly.

"Sir, you did," replied O'Donnell.  "I have spoken for the gentleman
beside me, Señor Don Ascanio de Hurtado y Custa, who is captain of
this vessel."

"I am honored, sir," returned my great-uncle.  "And yourself?"

O'Donnell did not altogether relish the playing of his part.  He bit
his lip and hesitated an instant before he answered.

"I am Colonel O'Donnell, an officer in the service of his Most
Catholic Majesty."

"Ah; and what can I do for you, gentlemen?" inquired my great-uncle.

O'Donnell hesitated again and conferred with the Spanish officer.

"Sir," he said then, "Don Ascanio asks you by me: Since when have
your country and Spain been at war?"

"To the best of my knowledge, they are not at this present," my
great-uncle answered blandly.

"Then to what cause must we attribute this--this--ah--unwarrantable
attack?" demanded O'Donnell.

"I am afraid," replied my great-uncle almost with sorrow, "that I am
unable to satisfy your curiosity upon that point."

The Spaniard burst into a declaration of passionate intensity, which
Murray interrupted.

"I am so fortunate as to comprehend the noble Spanish tongue," he
said.  "Would you be so kind, Colonel O'Donnell, as to acquaint your
friend with the fact, and to assure him that I regret he must accept
the situation as it stands?  I am desirous of sparing the lives of
those of his people who survive, but at a pinch I will slay them all
to compass my intention."

"And what is that?" asked O'Donnell.

"To relieve Don Ascanio of the consignment of treasure he carries,"
answered my great-uncle.  "When it is aboard my ship he shall be at
liberty to continue his voyage."

O'Donnell proceeded haltingly to translate this statement.  He never
finished it.  The Spaniard launched a fresh torrent of curses, broke
his sword across his knee and tossed the pieces overside.  My
great-uncle nodded sympathetically.

"'Tis an unpleasant plight, I know," he said.  "Had Don Ascanio not
discarded his sword I should have been delighted to yield him an
opportunity for such satisfaction as one gentleman may give another.

"However--I must stipulate further, Colonel O'Donnell, that the crew
of the _Santissima Trinidad_ shall be placed in confinement for so
long as suits my purpose.  Any resistance must cause additional
bloodshed, which, I am sure, you will agree is unnecessary."

"Don Ascanio will say no more," returned O'Donnell.  "He washes his
hands of the whole proceeding.  Abandoned by his crew----"

"Enough," interrupted my great-uncle.

He rattled off a sentence in Spanish, and there was an answering
rattle of arms thrown on the deck.  He spoke again, and the
_Santissima Trinidad's_ men all shifted to starboard and marched into
the fo'csle, herded by a bristle of pirate cutlasses.

Murray walked aft to where Peter and I still stood, uncertain what to
do next.

"Have you seen her?" he asked.

"I think she is in that group of priests and nuns under the stern
lanthorn," I said.

He compressed his lips, a habit he had whenever he must turn to some
task he did not overly care for.

"'Tis a trick I shall find as distasteful as O'Donnell did our
colloquy just now," he said shortly.  "But we must be about it
without delay.  Our cannonade will have been heard ashore in
Hispaniola with this wind.  We must gather our loot and away."




CHAPTER XIII

TROUBLE BOARDS THE ROYAL JAMES

The silence was oppressive as we ascended the poop ladder.  A last
babble of Latin ended on an hysterical note.  The Spanish captain
glared his hatred, gnawing at his hands as he leaned against the
rail, and when my great-uncle drew a laced handkerchief from his coat
pocket and began to wipe clean his red blade 'twas more than Don
Ascanio could stand.  He stalked to the far side of the deck,
rumbling curses, and fixed his gaze upon the purple hills of
Hispaniola.  Behind the steering-wheel the black flock of religious
gathered closer under the great, gilded lanthorn which crowned the
high, pulpit-like recess intended to protect the helmsman; and
amongst those cowled shaven-heads and shapeless swathed forms the
slim grace and sunny, blue eyes of Moira O'Donnell were as patent as
the growing fear with which her father met us.

My great-uncle nodded a satisfaction I was unable to comprehend.

"A fair maid, Robert!" he exclaimed.  "Well, well!  This is fine.  I
might ask no better.  I congratulate you, _chevalier_," he added to
O'Donnell.  "Your daughter is as dainty a little lady as I have seen
in a long life."

O'Donnell understood his mood no better than I.

"I wish she was out of this," he growled resentfully.  "Don Ascanio
has placed the conduct of matters in my hands.  What is next?  Must
you----"

He gestured expressively toward the vessel beneath us.

"It seems--  I--I find myself--  'Tis a nauseating prospect--
Several hundred men--and priests and nuns, Murray--  Aye, a cardinal
sin, one I'll never have absolution for, whatever betide--

"You concern yourself without cause," said Murray soothingly.  "We
have arranged it differently, and to that end I shall act a part with
your daughter which you must support; aye, to the offering of
violence.  And now, tell me, where is the treasure?"

"In the lazaret."

"Master Saunders!" called my great-uncle.

The second mate thrust his way to the front of the mob of pirates on
the main deck.

"Take fifty men and break out a quantity of treasure from the lazaret
of the prize."

"Aye, aye, sir," returned Saunders, and the pirates fell over
themselves in their alacrity to have a hand in his business.

My great-uncle concluded the cleaning of his sword, crossed to the
larboard railing and tossed the bloodied handkerchief overboard.

"Oh, Master Martin," he hailed the mate on the poop of the _Royal
James_.

"Aye, aye, sir," answered Martin.  "---- ---- ---- ---- my gizzards
for a ---- ----, but we ha' done a clean job this morning."

"I find myself in agreement with your sentiments, Martin," replied my
great-uncle.  "Be so good as to have a whip rigged from the
foreyard-arm to sling aboard the treasure which Saunders is breaking
out.  You will also tell off a score or two of men to make any
essential repairs at once.  I would have the ship ready to sail as
soon as we cast off, which will be the moment the prize's cargo is
transshipped."

"Aye, aye, sir, I'll attend to it all myself," Martin assured him.
"---- my eyes for a ---- ---- ----  and all the Twelve Apostles,
blast 'em for a ---- ---- lot of ---- ---- ----."

"A pungent fellow, Martin!" commented my great-uncle, recrossing the
deck.  "But we must play our little comedy here.  You, _chevalier_,
are cast for the _Anguished Parent_.  I am the _Aged Libertine_.
Peter is the _Mute_ with the bowstring--be gentle, Peter.
Robert--humph!  I scarce know how to describe your rôle, Robert.
You, shall we say, are to be _Youth_?  Ah, yes!  Youth, immortal,
selfish, impulsive, acquisitive, mendacious----"

Colonel O'Donnell regarded him as if he had lost his sanity.

"What folderol is this?" he broke in.

"You shall see," answered Murray.  "'Tis our way of carrying you off
without focusing the suspicion of Don Ascanio and his people upon
your personal participation in this interesting episode.  But to
continue the enumeration of our cast.  Your daughter, of course, is
the _Innocent Victim_.

"And this, Robert, leads me to recast you.  I shall deny you the
satisfaction of virtue--which after all, the clergy tells us, is its
own reward.  You shall be _Youthful Wantonness_, and did we adopt all
the exigencies of the plot 'twould be necessary for you finally to
strive with me for the possession of the maid.  But we will wave that
anon.  Play up to me, nephew!  You, too, Peter!"

He left us and walked with a mincing gait, entirely different from
his real catlike prowl, up to the black-garbed cluster surrounding
Mistress O'Donnell.

"Stap me, a fair piece, this!" he drawled.  "Too fair to bloom
unseen.  Come hither, mistress!"

A fat monk spat an ejaculation at him in Spanish, and two of the nuns
threw their arms around the Irish girl.  Murray replied to the monk
in his own tongue, and with a virulent fluency which inspired the
whole group with pitiful terror.  But the maid answered him so
dauntlessly that it made the blood prickle in my neck.

"A black shame on you, old enough to be the father of me and these
others here!  I know you for what you are, Captain Rip-Rap, and if
you will be thinking I am one to fear you it is a sorry wakening you
will have.  Oh, you might better be down on your knees, asking pardon
for the wickedness you have wrought, than plotting fresh evil, and
threatening holy folk with your dreadful torments!"

The fat monk lifted a crucifix like a weapon and shook it in his
face, and Mistress O'Donnell put the two nuns aside and stood forth
in front of the group, with her arms spread wide to shelter them.

"So you recognize me?" said my great-uncle.  "'Tis an honor,
mistress.  But I fear you have heard much to my prejudice, and I must
press you to visit my ship and learn the contrary.  Certes, you
should be the first to rejoice to disprove such foul allegations
against an aged man."

"Step forward, colonel, and defend her," I muttered under my breath
to her father.

He had the grace to blush, but he acted upon my suggestion with a
semblance of sincerity.

"Sir, sir, what is this you do?" he cried.  "Certes, there is some
limit to your law-breaking!  The maid is my daughter."

My great-uncle went through his snuff ritual with an artful
exaggeration which was comical to one who knew him.

"Unfortunate!" he drawled.  "I could sympathize with you, sir."

And to me--

"Robert, you will conduct the lady to the _James_."

For the first time Mistress O'Donnell's glance lighted fair upon my
face.

"Master Ormerod!" she gasped.

I jumped toward her with as roughly peremptory a manner as I could
assume.

"You'd best come quietly, mistress," I snapped.

She flung out her hands to fend me off, and the fat monk and the two
nuns cast themselves upon us, the monk striking at my head with his
heavy crucifix and the nuns scratching and clawing so that I was put
to it to protect my eyes.  They were surely three of the bravest
people who ever lived, and but for Peter they would have worsted me.

The big Dutchman waded stolidly into the confusion, shoved O'Donnell
from his path, upset the monk and pushed the two nuns out of the way.

"You take der little gal, Bob," he squeaked.

She struggled with all the strength in her lissome body, but I pinned
her hands and tossed her over my shoulder--and then her father
attacked me with the Spanish captain, whose patience had been
exhausted by this last outrage.

Murray drew his sword and forced the Spaniard back, and Peter slung
O'Donnell over his shoulder as easily as I had the maid.

"I got him, _ja_," he announced to Murray.

My great-uncle sheathed his sword.

"Carry him along," he said.  "Since he is so much concerned as to his
daughter's fate, we will permit him to watch it.  Afterward, it may
be, he can afford us some additional amusement.  Stap me, a most
persistent fellow!"

The fat monk picked himself up from the deck, waving his crucifix,
and launched a tumult of invective which my great-uncle received with
raised eyebrows and an occasional humorous interjection.  But I had
my hands full controlling my prisoner, and paid no more attention to
what happened on the poop after I reached the main-deck ladder.

A line of pirates staggered across the deck, backs stooped beneath
burdens of portly casks and iron-bound chests, wire-wrapped and
padlocked, each a-dangle with leaden seals impressed with the arms of
the Spanish king.  They leered at my writhing captive and grinned
openly at the ridiculous spectacle presented by Colonel O'Donnell's
lank form draped over Peter's shoulder.  But they all looked quickly
away as my great-uncle descended to us.

"Can you manage her alone?" he asked me curtly.

My temper was thoroughly aroused by the false position in which I had
been placed, and I vented it upon him.

"I'll manage her or go overboard with her," I barked.

He smiled.

"The right spirit, lad!  Tut, tut, mistress," as she wrenched a hand
free and dug at my eyes.  "You concern yourself for nothing.  We have
but played at a game.  Observe your father's attitude."

"The greater his shame!" she hissed.  "That he should have suffered
you to take me alive!"

"We are friends," urged my relative, lowering his voice.  "'Tis but a
pretense we make----"

"Friends!"

Her white teeth clicked in an effort to bite my ear.

"Ah, you are friends to the Powers of Evil."

"Be patient a little longer, Moira," pleaded her father from his
perch on Peter's shoulder.  "I'll explain----"

She went of a sudden entirely limp and burst into a passion of
weeping.

"Oh, _padre_, _padre_, to think of you a coward!  'Tis worst of all!"

O'Donnell swore helplessly.

"Let me down till I settle her mind," he begged.

But Murray rebuked him.

"They are watching you from the poop, _chevalier_.  Struggle as much
as you please--'tis all one to Peter--but if you value your future
security in Spain do not seem to give in to us."

I climbed by way of a carronade on to the larboard bulwarks, holding
Mistress O'Donnell with one arm the while I hooked a strand of
rigging with the other; and even as I collected myself to jump the
gap that separated the two vessels she twisted free of me and would
have slid overside--to be crushed to death, most likely, for the two
hulls were continually grinding together.  I caught her in the nick
of time, letting go my clutch upon the rigging, and was near to being
dragged down with her, teetering back and forth as aimless as a
feather blown by the wind.  So that, what with her struggles and my
own loss of balance, I gritted my teeth and jumped most precariously,
hit or miss, and, I am bound to admit, landed upon the _James'_
bulwarks rather by good fortune than skill.

I dropped to the deck in no very pleasant mood.  Faith, I could have
slapped the tear-stained face that was pressed against my shoulder;
and in the excess of my disgust I thrust her from me.

"An ill recompense for one that hath been at pains to spare your
father's reputation, mistress," I growled, as surly as any pirate of
the crew.  "You might ha' been my death."

She looked at me, too surprized to answer at once, and before she had
recovered herself my great-uncle and Peter joined us, Peter still
placidly carrying Colonel O'Donnell like a flour-sack.

Murray cast a swift glance of appraisal around his ship.

"We have come through very creditably," he remarked.

Martin hailed him from the poop.

"By your leave, sir, we're whole aloft, 'ceptin' a few ropes as the
topmen are splicin' and a rent in the mizzen royal."

"That's well," replied my great-uncle.  "How many casualties?"

"We ha' put twelve overside, and there's two as'll follow, and twenty
---- ---- ---- lubbers as must nurse their carkisses."

"Very good, Martin.  I shall be in the cabin.  Let me know so soon as
the prize's treasure is all aboard."

He turned to us.

"The curtain is ready to fall upon our comedy.  Will you accept my
arm, Mistress O'Donnell?  A glass of wine and a bite of sailor's fare
will taste better than Robert's ear, which your hunger prompted you
to nibble.  Fie, fie, my lass!"

She stared at him with utter horror, yet suffered him to place her
hand upon his arm.  The spirit was gone out of her, exhausted by the
strain she had been subjected to.  And I forgot my anger at sight of
the agony of dumb fear mirrored in her lovely eyes.  She was like a
butterfly spiked on a thorn.

Something of the same sensation must have affected my relative, for
he patted the limp hand on his arm with a truly paternal kindness.

"Come, come, did I not say the comedy was ended?" he chided her.  "I
have played the _Aged Libertine_, 'tis true, but the rôle is now
abandoned.  You are as safe here as in your Spanish convent.  But the
deck is too public for our revelations.  We will seek the seclusion
of the cabin, and there the complete tale shall be unfolded for your
reassurance, with your father a witness to support it."

She shook her head.

"I--I--know not what you mean."

"To be sure," he agreed.  "But you soon shall."

Peter, behind us, grunted to command Murray's attention.

"Does der colonel walk or ride?"

"Stap me!" exclaimed my great-uncle, "I was forgetting your father's
present plight, mistress."

"I feel like a fool!" snarled the Irishman.

"How unreasonable!" deplored Murray.  "Have you not been acting the
part of an _Outraged Parent_ who sacrificed all in defense of his
daughter?  My dear _chevalier_, what rôle could you select more
heroical?"

"Give over your mummery," protested O'Donnell.  "I'll not be made a
mock of, sir!"

"Rightly spoken!" cried my great-uncle.  "You shall not be,
_chevalier_.  Peter, good friend, prithee take three steps within the
companionway and there deposit Colonel O'Donnell with decent
propriety upon the two limbs Nature intended for his locomotion.  Ah!
Excellent!  Allow me, mistress!"

Peter and I followed the three of them up the dark tunnel of the
companionway.

"We are past one danger-mark, Peter," I whispered.  "What's to come?"

"Trouble," mumbled Peter.

"Trouble?"

"_Ja_.  To get der treasure, I saidt dot was easy, Bob.  But to
divide der treasure--dot's trouble.  Andt now we got a woman on der
ship--andt dot's more trouble."

Ben Gunn and the two negro lackeys ushered the party to their seats.
Mistress O'Donnell sank into hers with a weariness that was pathetic.
She was quite regardless of her surroundings.  'Twas as if she was
become reconciled to whatever misfortune was in store for her.  And
she did not so much as glance at her father, who sat morosely upon
Murray's left hand across the table from her.  Peter took his
accustomed place at the opposite end, and I sat beside her.

"Let me give you a glass of this _aqua vitae_, my lass," said my
great-uncle.  "'Tis efficacious for fatigue and the migraine.  See, I
taste it myself.  'Tis quite all right.  You, too, _chevalier_?
Excellent!  Perhaps you will pass the flask to Master Corlaer yonder.
You gentlemen should know each other after your recent intimate
contact.  And Master Ormerod yonder--my nephew.  But I believe you
and your daughter have had previous acquaintance with him."

O'Donnell muttered something none too civil, but the maid bestirred
herself, and her eyes examined me again with the mingling of horror
and stupefaction which governed her mood.

"How come you here?" she asked.  "You--you--are you also a pirate?"

"I am a captive as surely as yourself," I returned.  "Aye, more so."

"A captive!" she exclaimed, her interest fanned alight.  "But surely
you----"

My great-uncle interrupted her.

"Please, Mistress O'Donnell!  Our tale is sufficiently complicated.
Let us not make it more difficult to comprehend by confusing it at
the beginning with side-issues."

"Gunn!"

"Yessir!"

The steward ducked and scraped.

"Give us whatever food you have prepared, swiftly.  And fetch up some
wines--port, burgundy, claret, madeira."

"Yessir."

Ben Gunn writhed himself into the companionway.  Murray resumed his
discourse to the Irish girl.

"First, that there may be no misunderstanding, mistress, 'tis true
that I am he who is known as Captain Rip-Rap."

She shrank away from him in a renewed access of terror.

"I have already told you that you have no cause to fear me," he went
on gently, "and to prove that to you I will add that I am an
outlaw--what is called a pirate, although I detest the word
myself--because I am a Jacobite.  I believe, too, I may claim your
father as my friend."

He looked inquiringly at O'Donnell.  The Irishman drained his glass.

"'Tis true," he assented.  "This gentleman is one Andrew Murray, who
was out in the '15 and was afterward in trouble in New York Province
on the score of intrigues with our friends and the French, Moira.  He
hath been a good servant to King James."

"But for why will you have been the death of all the poor folk on the
_Santissima Trinidad_?" she cried.  "And your men will be lifting the
treasure that is Spain's, and Spain a safe haven for the exiles the
Hanoverian will not suffer to serve their rightful king and dwell in
Britain!"

"'Tis regrettable that Spaniards had to die, lass," answered my
great-uncle, lowering his voice to a proper depth of emotion.  "But I
call to your mind that Spain has not helped the Good Cause as she
might when there was a bonny chance of fetching the Stuarts home."

"That is God's truth," she admitted with quick passion.

"Therefore," pursued my great-uncle, "some of us have concerted it to
seize a portion of Spain's treasure and turn it to the purpose of
winning back for King James his crown."

"I am thinking 'tis not overhonest," she said doubtfully.

"You are no more than a lass," rebuked her father, emptying his
second glass.  "'Tis not for you to be saying what is honest and what
is not honest in politics, of which you have no knowledge."

"Indeed," interposed my great-uncle, "the question as to what is
honest and what is dishonest in politics is one upon which men have
been unable to agree since the times of Aristotle."

"Yet even politicians can not honestly confuse the dishonesty of
taking one man's gold for another man's profit," I put in.

Mistress O'Donnell gave me a sidewise look.

"We are speaking of kings, not of men," my great-uncle pointed out.

"I am afraid I will be of Master Ormerod's way of thinking," said the
Irish maid.

"You talk nonsense, Moira," blustered her father.  "Is it not better
that this treasure should be employed to recover England and all the
lands pertaining to the English crown for their rightful rulers--who
will assist in the restoration of the True Faith--than that it should
be poured into the pockets of the king's favorites at Madrid?  You
are only a child, and 'tis not fitting for you to know all that goes
on in the world; yet common sense, ordinary religious devotion and
affection for your king might tell you so much.  Why, lass, there are
great lords, aye, a prince of the Church, no less, that set the seal
of their approval to what we do."

Moira O'Donnell hung her head.

"Sure, I am only an ignorant lass as you say, _padre_, one that knows
no more than the sisters taught her in the convent; but there's that
in me cries out stronger than learning or creed or loyalty."

Colonel O'Donnell hammered his fist upon the table-top--he had just
drained a third glass.

"And this is the child of a race that have been pulled down from the
high places of the land by the tyrant, and their heads and limbs
strewn God knows where, and those who escaped death driven to poverty
and exile!  Girl, you know not what you say.  The people of Spain
will be thanking us for the use to which we turned their
treasure--and then we'll pay it back," he added with a happy
inspiration.

"Odds, that we will!" endorsed my great-uncle.  "What's a million and
a half pounds to royal Spain?  Aye, or to an England that waxes
grandly prosperous under wise Stuart rule?"

"'Twill be the difference betwixt honor and dishonor," I cried hotly.
"As for prosperity, England was never richer, as any man who earns
his living honestly would tell you.  King George may be a Dutchman
and talk with an accent and spend more time in Hanover than London;
but he keeps his hands off trade, and that means wealth for all
who'll labor."

Colonel O'Donnell favored me with a fishy glance.

"It seems we must both reckon with disloyalty in our families,
Murray," he remarked dryly.

"Never give it a thought, sir," replied my great-uncle.  "Tut, tut,
_chevalier_, they are young and shall learn by experience.  Let them
argue it between themselves, eh?  That should fetch them around."

"I'll not suffer any to call me disloyal!" exclaimed Moira.  "I am
all for the Stuarts; but I'd not have them resort to dishonest means
to win what is their own."

"Humph," said my great-uncle.  "To win their own, my lass, they must
have money.  If you will tell us where else in the wide world they
are to obtain it, I'll transship this treasure back aboard the
_Santissima Trinidad_."

She was silent.

His suave manner conveyed subtly an implication of the importance he
attached to her approval.

"I would not inflict a dose of the material philosophy of age upon
one so young and charming, my dear," he went on; "but possibly you
will forgive me if I indicate to you the regrettable circumstance
that the ideal is seldom attainable?  In other words, mistress, to
obtain the greatest good for the greatest number of people it is
occasionally necessary to inflict misery, suffering, even death, upon
a lesser number.  As in the present case, in order to secure the
means for reëstablishing King James and what your father so quaintly
terms the True Faith in the British Isles, it hath been necessary for
a gentleman of questionable legal status--myself--associated with
others of yet more dubious antecedents and repute, to procure the
death of divers Spanish persons, who, of themselves, had never
wrought any harm against us or the cause we served.

"Paradoxical, I must admit, involving an apparent denial of the
essential elements of divine justice, and in an ordinary light a
gross breach of the world's laws and conventions.  But 'tis by
precisely such contraventions of precedent and lettered laws that
epochal events are brought about.  I trust my reasoning is clear?"

"Faith, sir," she answered simply, "I think you will be poking fun at
me."

My great-uncle took snuff.

"I was never more serious," he asserted.

O'Donnell emptied a fourth glass with an impatient growl that masked
an oath.

"You are wasting time, Murray.  Moira is a good lass, and my
daughter; but what she thinks of this venture----"

"--is of considerable importance to me," my great-uncle protested.
"I was compelled in the beginning of our acquaintance to give her a
wrong impression of my character, and I am extremely desirous to have
her good opinion."

"You'd better work on your nephew first," the Irishman snapped.

"'Tis to earn his good opinion that I am so solicitous of her's," my
extraordinary relative admitted serenely, and the shadow of a smile
brightened her face.

"Troth, sir," she retorted, "I am thinking that is the wisest thing
you have said, for the young man appears to be the one of you that
has a prejudice for the plain truth--I can say nothing for the large
gentleman, since he has not opened his mouth."

Murray laughed.

"I will take to myself some of the credit you heap upon my nephew,"
he said.  "As to the 'large gentleman,' 'tis his custom to be silent;
eh, Peter?"

"_Ja_," said Peter.

"But why is he--" she blushed a trifle--"why is Master Ormerod a
captive?  Why does he say I am a captive, if----"

"You are not a captive," returned my great-uncle.  "At least, I say
that under the impression that, as your father's daughter and a
devout Jacobite, you would not, whatever your personal feelings might
be, undertake to interfere with our plans."

He waited, and after a pause she nodded her head.

"My grandnephew on the other hand," he continued, "as well as the
'large gentleman' yonder, are not political sympathizers with us--not
yet."

"Nor will they ever be," I corrected him.

"I shall beg leave to differ with you, Robert," he replied.
"Nevertheless, in justice to you, I will go on and acquaint Mistress
O'Donnell that I carried you by force aboard my ship, Peter
accompanying you of his own free will, for reasons which sufficiently
commended themselves to me."

"I am wondering are you all mad," she said blankly.

"You may well say so!" I exclaimed.  "The truth is this, mistress:
Master Murray hath besides his own ship's company a second band of
pirates the which are restless beneath his thumb.  He desired me to
be his lieutenant to help him hold them in restraint, and----"

"You restrained them bravely aboard the _Santissima Trinidad_!" she
said.  "My faith, but I am caught in a network of lies!"

"Moira!" gurgled her father, sopping his cuff as he finished his
fifth glass.  "Ye talk like a--like a--" his brogue thickened--"a
besom or what not at all.  I'll not have it!  I'll not have it, I
say!"

"That was to save you!" I declared.

"Troth, and I'm saved," she echoed sarcastically.

"Yes, you and your father," said Murray gravely.  "Colonel O'Donnell
risked everything on this coup of ours.  To protect him 'twas
essential it should never be known he was privy to it.  We had the
choice of two means to that end.  One was to sink the _Santissima
Trinidad_ with all hands except yourselves----"

She cried out in expostulation and clapped her hands to her eyes as
if to shut out the vision the words evoked.

"The other," he continued, "was to arrange to remove the two of you
in such fashion as to establish your innocence.  I am free to say the
first was the easiest course.  The dictates of humanity, however,
prevailed."

How he rolled that last sentence!

"And what do you know of humanity that soaked the decks of the
_Santissima Trinidad_ with blood?" she answered.  "You that the
Spaniards cite as a byword for cruelty and wickedness!  I will not
believe a word that you say.  I will not believe any man here.  You
are all smirched with the same badness."

"Blessed Virgin guard me!" whimpered O'Donnell.  "And did any ever
hear a daughter tell off her father the like of that?  Glad I am the
mother that bore ye----"

Peter leaned his great bulk forward upon the table.

"Don't talk no more, you," he commanded the Irishman.  "_Neen_, I
talk!  Little gal, Bob andt I we don't come wit' Murray because we
like to.  He makes us.  _Ja_!  He uses us.  He uses your fat'er.  He
uses you.  But when we are wit' him we do what we can to take care of
you.  It is not goodt for little gals to be on pirate ships.  _Neen_!"

He leaned back.

"Dot's all."

Her blue eyes dwelt seriously upon his vast, flat face, with its
insignificant features blobbed here and there.

"I believe _you_," she said.

"Stap me," jeered Murray.  "Our Peter is discovered a squire o'
dames--a _preux chevalier_.  Peter, you ha' disguised your talents.
We must know more of them."

"_Ja_," said Peter vacantly.

Mistress O'Donnell rose from her chair.

"Sir--" she addressed my great-uncle--"you will be excusing me if I
do not linger for more conversation.  What you do hath no concern
with me.  I am very distraught, and my heart is sick with the black
sorrow, and I--I--" she swayed a little--"I would lie me down
and--and--weep."

I slipped from my seat and steadied her.  Her father, opposite,
blinked at us through maudlin tears.

"A sweet maid!" he hiccuped.  "She's all I ha' left from following
the Lost Cause.  Curse the Hanoverian----"

"Take her to your stateroom, Robert," said my great-uncle.  "You must
lodge with Peter."

He rose, himself, bowing with the fine courtesy which became him
nobly.

"What we can do to serve you, dear lass, that will we right gladly.
In the mean time, do you rest and forget the nightmare scenes I would
have spared you had I known how."

I guided her as far as the stateroom door.  She thanked me faintly as
I opened it for her, and I was abruptly impelled to recover her
friendship.

"What I tried to tell you was the truth," I murmured, the words
spilling fast from my tongue.  "Indeed it was so!  Peter Corlaer had
the right of it.  We two are no pirates, and all that we ha' done has
been intended to make smooth your way."

There was a wistful light in her eyes as she lifted them under long,
black lashes.

"God send you be honest, sir," she said.  "I--I must wait to judge.
The world is gone all twirly-round.  Even the _padre_----"

She choked back a sob.

"You will not misunderstand," she ended with quiet dignity, "if I say
no more that maybe already ha' said too much."




CHAPTER XIV

THE DEAD MAN'S CHEST

When I returned to the main cabin Ben Gunn was placing the food on
the table, and my great-uncle was removing the liquor from Colonel
O'Donnell's reach.

"We have had sufficient to drink, Ben," he said and, heedless of the
Irishman's disappointed face, waved away that which had been before
them as well as the new array of bottles one of the lackeys bore upon
a silver tray.

Nothing more was said until the steward and the negroes had retired.
Then Murray sat forward in his chair.

"There is a certain matter of importance to be discussed, colonel,"
he announced.  "I must have your attention."

O'Donnell nodded sulkily.

"As you know, the crew of my associate, Captain Flint, some of whom
you saw in New York, are not under the same discipline as my own men.
Captain Flint saw fit to express jealousy of the terms I arranged
with your principals for the division of the treasure, and in order
to conciliate him and assure him of my good faith I gave him my
grandnephew and Master Corlaer as hostages.  They went unwillingly
and succeeded in escaping before we sailed, returned aboard the
_James_ and secreted themselves for several days.  I dared not risk
the time to return them to Flint, and I anticipate that he will
receive me now with augmented suspicion."

"I said all along ye were crazy to let a low fellow like him have any
hand in the affair," fumed O'Donnell.

"We need not go over that again," rejoined my great-uncle.  "I must
have the security of the Rendezvous, and for that I must needs pay
Flint.  Also, I may have need of him in other ways.  This venture is
not yet consummated.  There is likewise the consideration that we
have worked together in the past, and I owe him a modicum of loyalty."

"Loyalty to the Cause should come first," declared O'Donnell.

"True, sir, and I yield it.  But I must look to the future.  'Tis
contrary to my policy to break with Flint if it can be avoided.  'Tis
similarly contrary to my instinct to trust him farther than I must,
and in this immediate case I am loath to trust him."

"What's to do?" rasped O'Donnell.  "Raise his price?"

"No, no.  My suggestion is that we should stow away our friends'
portion of the treasure before we return to the Rendezvous."

"Where?"

"I have been turning that in my mind for several weeks.  There is an
island south of Porto Rico in the Virgin Group, a barren dot, hated
by all seamen for sorry memories of shipwreck and suffering.  They
call it the Dead Man's Chest."

I remembered the deep, swinging chorus I had first heard in the
Whale's Head tavern the night I sought O'Donnell for his daughter.
It sounded like a fit place for pirate treasure.

The Irishman frowned.

"What?  Dump this gold we have risked so much to win on a sandbar for
the first passing fellow to----"

"I have said no man will go there if he can help it."

"I like it not!" scowled O'Donnell.  "My friends would have ugly
things to say did the stuff slip from our hands in that way."

"'Tis less likely to slip from our hands on the Dead Man's Chest than
abroad the _Royal James_," answered Murray.  "Bethink you,
_chevalier_!  To begin with, there is Flint to reckon with.  He will
be nasty, as nasty as he dares, depending upon the temper of his crew
and the quantity of rum he has consumed.  Second, there is always the
chance that we might fall in with a frigate too swift for us.  On all
scores 'tis preferable to get the treasure off the _Royal James_.
'Twill give us time to let the hue and cry of the Spaniards die down
and to arrange with your friends for its reception."

"Whatever you say, 'tis a miserable alternative," protested
O'Donnell.  "Let us rather hold north and set the treasure ashore in
France."

"To run the gauntlet of French and English cruisers?" my great-uncle
demanded scornfully.  "'Odsblood, man, you are out of your mind!  And
when you had landed it, what would you do?  How much of it would go
to your friends and how much to grease the pockets of French
officials?  A great treasure is not so easily disposed of."

"_Ja_," spoke up Peter, "dot's right, Murray.  But what goodt is it
to go back to Flint?  He makes trouble, always he makes trouble--andt
if he don't, his men does.  It's better you go anodder place."

My great-uncle took snuff, tapping the box thoughtfully after he had
dusted the powder in his nostrils.

"To be strictly honest with you, gentlemen," he remarked at last, "I
am disposed to return to Flint because I foresee a possibility of my
desiring to sacrifice him to cover our tracks.  I have no definite
plan in mind, but a situation might shape itself in which it would be
desirable to supply a fugitive for Spaniard, Frenchman and Englishman
to chase.  I should vastly prefer--as I am sure you would, too--that
the fugitive be the _Walrus_ and not the _James_.  Also, until that
situation arises, the Rendezvous is the safest hiding-place I know
this side of Africa."

O'Donnell eyed him with involuntary respect.

"I should hate to have ye set on my track, Murray!" he exclaimed.
"Is not Flint your friend?"

My great-uncle considered this question.

"Scarcely my friend," he decided.  "Say, rather, associate.  And the
fellow is troublesome occasionally.  I should have no hesitation in
sacrificing him to secure the stake we play for."

"And there is no real feeling of loyalty in your heart!" I gibed.
"'Tis simply a question of using him to your best advantage."

"Yes and no, Robert," he retorted coolly.  "As you grow older you
will learn that as naught is wholly bad neither is it wholly good."

A step clumped in the companionway, and Martin stuck his grizzled
head in the cabin.

"Last o' the ---- ---- ruddy-boys is comin' aboard, sir," he said.
"What course will ye set?"

Murray looked at the Irishman.

"Here's the moment for decision, sir," he said.  "'Tis for you to say
what shall be done."

O'Donnell's long face seemed to grow longer.

"Sure, and how will I know what to say that never gave thought to the
matter before?" he parried dubiously.  "Do I understand you to
suggest Captain Flint might attempt to possess the entire treasure?"

"I should consider it likely," assented my great-uncle.

"He is more likely to make trouble if you come to the Anchorage after
disposing of half the gold," I thrust in.  "'Twill only serve to
stimulate his suspicions."

"There is reason in what you say," agreed my great-uncle.
"Nevertheless, permit me to indicate that if we have not the half of
the treasure 'twill be impossible for him to secure it by any means."

O'Donnell smacked his open hand upon the table top.

"A truce to arguing!" he exclaimed.  "I am in your hands, Murray,
whether it pleases me or not.  Do whichever you think best."

My great-uncle turned to the mate.

"Cast loose from the prize, Master Martin, and make all sail.  The
course is so'east by south.  I would have you stand off out of sight
of the Porto Rican shore."

"Aye, aye, sir."

Martin hesitated.

"And the treasure, cap'n?" he added.

"Benn Gunn will give you the keys of the lazaret.  'Twill go there as
usual."

"Aye, aye, sir."

There was an interval of silence after he had gone.  The shouts of
the pirates echoed from the deck, with the creaking of halyards and
napping of sails.  The _Royal James_ seemed to shake herself as she
sidled free of the battered hull of the _Santissima Trinidad_, and
through the stern windows showed the bowsprit and fo'csle of the
Spaniard, still smothered beneath a mess of canvas and broken spars
and rigging.  Slowly we drew past her, and I was amused to see that
men leaned from her ports and on her bulwarks, watching us with the
idle curiosity to be expected in any friendly meeting at sea.

The Spanish flag still flaunted at her main where it had stayed
throughout the action.  Don Ascanio, her captain, still stood with
folded arms and furious mien on the poop.  The group of religious
were all on their knees in prayer.  The fat monk raised his crucifix
with a threatening gesture as we glided under her stern.

"Observe the fallacy of religious conviction," commented Murray.
"The monk curses us for a crime we have not committed."

"There is enough evil to your credit to warrant him, even so," I
answered.

O'Donnell crossed himself.

"Leave religion alone, Murray," he said sourly.  "'Tis a bid for
ill-fortune to mock the Church and holy men and women."

"Prejudice, my dear _chevalier_!" protested my great-uncle.  "Yet any
sane view of mundane affairs must recognize religion hath its uses to
mankind."

He rose.

"If you will pardon me, I have much to see to on deck.  Should you
desire any refreshment do but ring that bell and state your wants to
the steward.  Robert, if you and Peter can so far submerge your
Hanoverian sympathies I should appreciate such aid as you might
render in the accounting of the treasure."

Peter and I went with him, as much to escape the company of the
Irishman as to satisfy our curiosity regarding the chests and boxes
we had glimpsed in transit across the _Santissima Trinidad's_ deck.
And certes, the scene that awaited us was worth going far to see.
The maindeck, immediately for'ard of the poop, was jammed with the
contents of the Spaniard's lazaret, piled helterskelter as the
working-parties had hastily shifted it from one ship to the other.

Murray produced tablet and ink-horn; a desk was arranged for me atop
of a water-butt, and one by one a procession of pirates filed past,
each with his load of gold or silver, minted and in bullion.

'Twas a marvelous concentration of wealth.  The columns of figures I
set down upon the tablet never condescended to detail--5,000 pieces
of eight, they would run, or 10,000 doubloons, 12,000 onzas, 20,000
castellanos, 25,000 eights, and so on.  One cask we opened was filled
with quaint Eastern coins, some square, some oblong, some cubical,
some round, inscribed with spidery characters, a consignment from the
Spanish possessions in the South Seas.  There was upward of two
hundred thousand pounds in bar silver, fifty-pound ingots sheathed by
threes in thick canvas jackets to facilitate their transport by
mule-trains--each mule carrying a load of three hundred pounds.
There was a quantity, too, of gold bullion, each ingot of eighty
pounds in its own canvas jacket.  There were a chest of precious
stones, the value of which we could only guess at, and three chests
of plate.

The total value, by the Government estimates upon each package, chest
or keg, was £1,563,995 in English money, exclusive of the jewels and
the plate; and we did not conclude the accounting and bestowal of the
treasure in Ben Gunn's wine-cellar until an hour past dusk, when
Murray dismissed all hands with an extra ration of rum and instructed
Saunders, who had the watch, to allow his men to sleep on deck,
except those actually needed for lookouts and the wheel.

In the cabin we found Colonel O'Donnell asleep, sprawled on the table
with his head rested on his folded arms, a puddle of wine by his
elbow.  My great-uncle's eyebrows twitched upward.

"This gentleman is a chamberlain to King James, Robert," he remarked,
"a Knight of Malta and of Santiago in Spain, a colonel of Spanish
engineers and lord of I know not how many bog-manors in Ireland if he
had his rights.  And look at him!"

He was not a pleasant sight, I'll own; but my redoubtable relative's
perpetual air of omniscience grated upon me.

"Who brought him to this?" I retorted.

"Not I, my boy!  To intrigue is not necessarily to license appetite.
Well, well, 'tis doubtly fortunate I induced him to fetch along the
little maid."

"'Twas well nigh your most dastardly act!"

He took snuff, deliberately pondering the charge, and despite the
toil of the day his face preserved its uncanny fulness of outline.

"The appearances are against me," he answered.  "Yet I am inclined to
believe that in the long run you will concede I acted for the best.
Consider her plight in a Spanish convent, if anything happened to her
father."

"Consider her plight in a pirate ship, if anything happened to him!"
I jeered.

He appealed to Peter, whimsically humorous.

"Stap me, the boy wears upon my nerves!  Was ever a youth so callow
in his assurance of righteousness?"

Peter's little eyes twinkled.

"He is right, andt you are right.  But we better put der colonel in
his bed, _ja_."

"'A Daniel come to judgment!'" cried Murray.  "Now what might you
mean by that, friend Peter?"

"You know what I mean--andt I know what you mean," returned the
Dutchman solemnly.  "You are a big rascal, but dot time maybe you was
right."

"Don't be an idiot, Peter," I rasped.

"'Tis you are the idiot," affirmed my great-uncle.  "Here are you and
Peter--two honest men if any ever were--and myself, with less claim
to virtue perhaps, but as acute an interest, if the truth be known.
And all three of us a-hungering to safeguard the lass.  What mother
might ask more?"

"And Flint," I amended.  "He'd protect her, I suppose."

"He'll never have the chance, Robert," he answered gravely.  "You and
Peter have played ducks and drakes, between you, with my plans; but
John Flint is not the man to overreach me.  Give him rope, lad--and
we'll present him his chance to hang."

"_Ja_," said Peter.  "We take care of der little gal--andt so we put
der colonel in his bed."

And so we did, to an accompaniment of stammered oaths and tags of
Jacobite ditties.

Afterward, in Peter's stateroom, I asked him what he had been hinting
at in his exchange with Murray.

"Oh, we just talk," he replied, rolling into his berth with a
ponderous sigh of satisfaction.

"I heard you," I snapped.  "But of what?"

There was a dim light in his eyes, buried behind rolling flaps of
blubber.

"We just talk," he murmured.  "Murray talks, andt I talk.  Murray, he
likes to talk, _ja_."

I was up early in the morning, but Mistress O'Donnell and my
great-uncle were before me.  As I climbed to the poop I saw them
standing by the weather rail, Murray expressing deference in every
line of his straight figure and handsome, old-young face, the little
maid eying him with a comical mixture of antipathy and respect.

The wind had veered in the night, providentially for us, and we were
running free, the _James_ riding the easy swell with the dash of a
race-horse.  We were out of sight of land.

My great-uncle clapped his hand on my shoulder in his best paternal
manner, and Mistress O'Donnell gave me a shy look that I read to
reflect a double attitude of mind similar to that she evidenced for
him.

"Here is my nephew, who will settle all your remaining doubts,
Mistress Moira," proclaimed Murray; "and with your leave I'll be
about my morning inspection--for we must maintain a high level of
discipline, since we sail on the king's errand and are therefore the
king's ship."

She watched his retreating back with a kind of fascination.

"Sure, I never met the like of him," she said at last.  "He puts me
in mind of the grand gentry the _padre_ brings to see me in
Madrid--and him a pirate!  Glory, what a tale I could be telling the
girls if I ever see the four walls of St. Bridget's again!  Whiles I
talk with him he makes me feel there's none other so grand and fine
in the broad world.  And again I'll remember the screaming on the
_Santissima Trinidad_ and what Frey Sebastian said of him--and then
the shivers turn me winter-cold.  But I'm thinking yourself will be
the same queer sort, Master Ormerod, you that can be generous and
gallant to a foolish maid and as cruel as the wildcat the Indians
showed us in the hills up behind Porto Bello."

"It must seem so to you," I answered.  "But the truth is that I am as
much the sport of Fate as yourself."

"Do you tell me so?" she replied politely.

"I do," I said with energy.  "Let me tell you the whole story--it
begins on the night I accompanied you to the Whale's Head----"

"Ah, that was a night of nights!" she exclaimed.  "The first breath
of adventure ever I drew, and I was thinking to myself as I hugged
the memory afterwards I could never get enough of that same savor.
But yesterday was the curing of my hunger."

And her blue eyes clouded with tears and the corners of her mouth
quirked downward most dolefully.

"Do but let me tell you my story," I pleaded, "and you will think
better of that night and maybe of some things that happened
afterward."

"Why, sir," she said, "here are you with a ready tongue, and me with
two ears wide open.  There's naught to stop you.  But as to
believing--that will be a story for me to tell and you to hear."

So I began at the beginning and told her all from the moment Darby
McGraw had run into the counting-room in Pearl Street--and how remote
in time and place that seemed as we stared out upon the blue-green
rollers of the Caribbean and the tropic sun warmed toward its noon
intensity!  She listened with mounting interest, never interrupting
save for an occasional "Glory!" "Oh, blessed saints!" "Holy Virgin,
can such things be!"  But when I came to the escape from the _Walrus_
she broke in upon me.

"And you did that to be handy by if I had need of you!  Oh, sir,
forget the wicked suspicions I owned!  'Tis a true friend you will
be--and the large gentleman, too.  What is he called?  Master
Corlaer?  Alas, I am heavy in your debt, and always shall be.  But
the only payment I ever can make will be just my bare thanks and the
prayers I'll say on my bended knees my life long."

She was wholly trustful with Peter and me from then on and spent most
of her time with us.  Her father, when he was not drinking, was
engaged in conferences with Murray.  They worked for hours at a time
with quill and paper, figuring the strength of clans, costs of
muskets and powder and lead and the number of field-cannon to be
stowed in a ship's hold, as also the individual requirements of
chiefs and nobles and the amounts for which several persons would
"sell out."  And as they worked my great-uncle's confidence
increased, and Colonel O'Donnell's long, horsey face took on a flush
over the cheekbones that was not alone the result of four bottles of
madeira at a sitting.

On the seventh morning after the action with the _Santissima
Trinidad_ we raised a low, sandy islet, densely choked with low trees
and bush growth, bare of any characteristic that invited human
habitation.  Its only distinguishing feature was its roughly oblong
shape, which might, by a stretch of imagination, enable it to be
likened to a sailor's chest.  Murray approached it with caution, a
man in the chains dipping the lead continually, and we came to anchor
under its lee and a mile or more offshore.

In the mean time Martin and a party of some fifty men had been
passing up treasure from the wine-cellar or lazaret, the mate
checking the amounts withdrawn upon the list I had prepared, the
pirates muttering amongst themselves in a way not at all to my fancy
as they gaged anew the size of the fortune they had won, without, so
far, any benefit or reward.  Martin was a competent officer, and he
kept them at work, for all their grumbling and discontent, until the
anchor cable ran out and Murray issued an order to lower all the
small boats.  The next thing we knew the fifty had hurled the mate
into the scuppers and were swarming up the starboard poop ladder, a
giant North-countryman at their head.

Murray, who had been talking with O'Donnell, leaped to meet them, as
unperturbed as if the incident were a part of the ship's routine.

"Get back there, men," he ordered quietly.

The leaders halted, sullenly irresolute, cowed at once by the red
glare in his tawny eyes, the cold power that radiated from his white
face.

"We'm on'y seekin' a bit goold," said the first man hoarsely.

My great-uncle calmly produced a small, double-barreled French
pistolet from an inner pocket, shot the fellow in the head, leaned
forward and pushed his body off the ladder.

"Master Martin," he called, "be so good as to have that carrion cast
overboard.  Go about your work, men, or I'll flog the lot of you at
the triangles."

They tumbled down the ladder and disintegrated like a pack of sheep,
and not one raised a hand when Martin came at them, cursing
grotesquely in his gentle voice and striking right and left with
knotted fists.  Two of them obeyed his order to throw the dead man's
body over the rail, and they went straight to the boat-falls without
another mutinous word or act.

Yet when Murray turned to face us I noted the tiny wrinkle betwixt
his eyebrows which was a sure indication that he was worried.

Moira O'Donnell, who had been standing with Peter and me, listening
to my recital of the song about the island, was the first to speak.

"Will you have had to shoot that man?" she challenged.

"'Twas that or maybe the deaths of all of us, my lass," he replied,
unwontedly grim.  "A shipload of men like my crew are a volcano of
lawlessness held in restraint by fear.  Let them once break the spell
of discipline--which is maintained by fear--and they in their numbers
would soon overpower us.  This incident is relatively unimportant,
but it points a lesson I should be reckless not to heed.

"To be brief, my friends," my great-uncle, summed up, "I dare not
leave the _Royal James_ whilst any of the treasure is aboard; nor
would it be safe for me to entrust any of my crew with the location
of the hiding-place."

He took snuff, staring contemplatively at the sand-hillocks of the
Dead Man's Chest.

"Here, then, is my plan," he pursued.  "I will have eight hundred
thousand pounds set ashore in the boats--my own share of one hundred
thousand, _chevalier_, as well as the seven hundred thousand pounds
guaranteed to your friends.  I will then land you four, with
sufficient provisions, and bear away in the _James_ to the so'th'ard,
returning in five days to pick you up.  In the intervening period you
should be able to transport the treasure to a safe spot and bury it.
In that way, _chevalier_, its safety can be assured until we are able
to return for it with the _James_ or some other craft dispatched by
your friends."

"Your plan is maybe the best in the circumstances," answered
O'Donnell, "but I'd have ye remember, Murray, that of the four people
who will know of the gold's location two are Hanoverians and the
third is my daughter, who is a weak maid."

My great-uncle laughed.

"You need have no fear on the score of those three.  You little know
Mistress Moira if you call her a weak maid; and as for Robert and
Peter, they are men of honor--and best of all, are not likely to be
submitted to the temptation to reveal the treasure to their political
friends.  No, no, colonel; by my plan the treasure will be safer than
in a bank."

There was more talk back and forth, but the end of it all was that
O'Donnell accepted my great-uncle's plan, and Moira was won over
likewise by the argument that so long as the treasure was stolen it
had best be assured to a worthy purpose.  Peter and I agreed for a
complex of reasons--because of the little maid for one thing, and for
another, because there was an excitement in the burial of treasure
which neither of us had tasted before, and also, of course, because,
when all was said and done, we were prisoners and we must.  But I'd
never seek to deny that we had pleasure from the thrill that came to
us late in the afternoon of that day as we stood on the narrow beach
of the islet beside a great stack of kegs and chests, axes, pickaxes
and shovels, a barrel of water and boxes of food from Ben Gunn's
larder, watching the boat that had landed us pull back to the _James_.

The ensuing five days demanded an amount of manual labor which
extracted wails of indignation from Colonel O'Donnell, much
uncomplaining effort from Moira and all the strength Peter and I
possessed.  Indeed, without the big Dutchman we might never
transported that amount of treasure, dug a hole for it and concealed
the location, all within the time-limit Murray had allowed us.

The first afternoon and evening we spent in selecting a hiding-place
in a shallow valley protected from the terrible storms which sweep
those seas.  Colonel O'Donnell and Moira were detailed to do the
digging, as neither was as capable as Peter and I of managing the
weighty bulk of the casks and chests.  And after that we worked
unremittingly, except for a couple of hours at midday and a short
snatch of sleep about dawn; for the starlit nights, with their
bracing sea-winds, were the most comfortable times we had.  Yet the
tops'ls of the _James_ were within sight before we had disposed of
the last spadeful of sand from the hiding-place and replanted its
area with the trees and bushes we had removed with every care to
preserve their roots.

O'Donnell had an unconquerable aversion to laboring with his hands,
but his engineering knowledge enabled him to survey crudely the site
we used and plot certain angles which fixed it in our memories--a
precaution highly necessary, as when we had finished there was no
more evidence of what we had done than a slight instability about
several trees.  We had even gone so far as to transplant an
enterprising colony of land-crabs to scuttle back and forth over the
fresh-turned sand.  And in a month, we knew, the luxuriant growth
would have obliterated the narrow slash of the path that zigzagged
across the sand hillocks to the valley's lip.




CHAPTER XV

SUSPICIONS

From the Dead Man's Chest the _Royal James_ headed northwest into the
Atlantic.  Murray knew that the _Santissima Trinidad_ must have sent
the tidings of his feat the length and breadth of the Antilles.  By
now the Spanish squadrons would have put to sea from San Juan de
Porto Rico, Santo Domingo and the Havana, and the Caribbean would be
aswarm with _garda costas_; but more to be feared than all the
Spaniards' efforts would be the consequence of the complaint sure to
be dispatched to the port admiral at Kingston.  The Jamaica frigates
would carry a hunting-call to every English cruiser on the West
Indian station.

As it was, we were chased by a strange sail in the latitude of
southern Hispaniola, whose heaping canvas and lumbering gait bespoke
the ship-o'-the-line; and off Cuba we sighted three sail--a frigate
and two sloops--who chased us two days and a night to the eastward.
And the day after that we encountered the Brazils fleet, under convoy
of two sail of the line and half a dozen small fry, but my
great-uncle, nothing daunted, displayed his white ensign, fired a
salute to the Portuguese admiral and sailed through them.

Then we picked up a smart so'easter and ran our westing down
packet-fashion, with never a sail in sight for a week, until a
morning when the sun came up at our backs like a burnished copper
plaque and we saw the cone of the Spyglass lifting out of the haze
ahead.  A league or two farther on the whole island shaped itself
beneath its spine of hills, and a column of smoke from the Spyglass
told us that Flint's lookout had detected us.

The wind had continued strong through the night, but after dawn it
turned puffy and 'twas nearly noon when we passed into Captain Kidd's
Anchorage on the last of the flood.  There was a great bustle aboard
the _Walrus_, with boats plying to and from the shore, and as our
anchor splashed, the longboat put off from her side, Flint's red coat
like a flame in the stern sheets.

"Glory!" exclaimed Moira O'Donnell, her blue eyes wide with delighted
horror.  "There's one I'd not need to have pointed out to me to know
him a pirate--or the dreadful knaves that do be rowing the oars.  My
faith, look to the color of them, as red as Indians with the sun, and
they without the clothes any heathen would be by way of wearing."

She clapped her hands.

"But I like the kerchiefs on their heads.  See!  All red and green
and yellow and blue.  And the marks they have done in their skins."

Her father was otherwise impressed.  He glowered down at the heap of
treasure kegs, chests and packages which Murray had ordered fetched
on deck that morning, and then stared off at Flint's gaudy figure.

"And 'tis to scoundrels like yon ye'll be trusting the lives of all
of us, Andrew Murray!" he snarled.  "By times, man, I think there's a
green madness in your brain.  Why, the view of that gold and silver
below would be sufficient to tempt better men than they to commit
murder."

My great-uncle took snuff.

"Your diagnosis is correct, _chevalier_," he retorted.  "They would
cheerfully commit murder for a coveted knife or a sixpence with a
hole in it.  My design in revealing to them the entire extent of the
treasure we carry is to impress them at once with my good faith and
benumb their acquisitive faculties by the sight of greater wealth
than they ever dreamed of obtaining at one time."

A snort from Peter diverted attention to the Dutchman.

"You do not agree with me?" inquired Murray mildly.

"_Neen_!  A t'ief is a t'ief.  He steals to steal."

"Plausible," assented my great-uncle.  "Your idea is?"

"If Flint has der feel for it it don't matter what you show him.  He
wants all."

"Ah!"

Murray regarded more attentively the boatload of pirates just
rounding up to our port quarter.

"I see that Captain Flint has with him John Silver and the red-haired
Irish boy he calls his luck.  Humph!  You may be right, friend Peter.
But I should not be greatly concerned over that.  In many ways----"

He broke off, considering.  Colonel O'Donnell caught him up.

"Yes?  Yes?  What new deviltry are you planning?"

My great-uncle smiled.

"Certes, 'tis no deviltry to plan in a good cause--in the Good Cause.
Eh, Mistress Moira?"

She shook her head.

"You will be took quick with your wits for me to fathom them, Master
Murray," says she.  "I am but a young maid that knows no more than
that right is right."

"I protest you underrate yourself," he answered.

"What Moira thinks is of no consequence," interrupted O'Donnell.
"You have not answered me."

"True, _chevalier_.  I was thinking.  My thoughts are not completely
shapen, but 'twill do no harm if I reveal that it occurred to me that
in many ways it might simplify our problem did Captain Flint resort
to force."

The Irishman counted the gunports in the _Walrus'_ side.

"He seems to carry as heavy metal----"

"But on the sea, as on the land, 'tis the brain which overmatches
brute force, _chevalier_.  You, who are an engineer, do not need to
be reminded of this axiom.  However, we are not yet come to the
issue, and I am never one for engaging in a search for trouble.  All
I know clearly at this moment is that we can not afford to wander far
afield from the island, with the cruisers of three nations quartering
the seas for us."

"We are in an _impasse_," reflected O'Donnell gloomily.

"Not at all," rejoined my great-uncle.  "We have played our hand with
entire success so far in the game.  'Tis now for us to sit back and
await the plays of other participants.  What they do must determine
our next--  But Captain Flint is come aboard.  This conversation is
without purpose, since fact must now displace conjecture."

He eyed us all somewhat gravely.

"I have but one word more to say," he added.  "Whatever happens,
leave me to do the talking."

"Ye'd do it whether we would or no," growled O'Donnell.

Flint climbed over the bulwarks with a racket of oaths and swaggered
up to the poop.  Martin dropped a whip from a block on the mainyard,
and John Silver was hauled up in its bight, his crutch hanging from
his neck.  Darby and the rest scaled the side ladder and mingled with
the _James'_ crew.  Their eyes popped from their heads as they
circled the heap of treasure, Long John stumping with them, listening
avidly to the accounts of the _James'_ men, hefting the weight of the
packages of bullion and painfully deciphering the inscriptions on the
kegs and chests of coin.

Their chief was equally frank in revealing the lust of greed the
picture wakened in him.  His green eyes flickered hotly on either
side of his thin, beaked nose, and his blue jowl was bluer than ever,
the weather-worn skin over his cheekbones laced with a network of
crimson veins that brightened as his excitement increased.

Yet he forgot the treasure the instant his gaze fell upon Peter and
me.

"So your hostages returned to ye, Murray?  Gut me, 'twas a pretty
trick ye played us!  Ye'd keep faith wi' me, ye would!  Oh, yes!
Ye'd give me two hostages, instead o' one.  You'll fulfill your
contract, you will.  There's no need for it, to be sure, but ye'll do
anything to prove good faith to me!  And take both or none, says you.
Both or none!  Well, ye fooled me that time, Murray, but ye never
will again, by thunder--not if my name's John Flint!"

My great-uncle heard him out in silence, waiting until he had stepped
off the poop-ladder and stood facing us.

"I am not responsible for your losing the hostages," he replied then
in his iciest tones.  "Stap me, Flint, I warned you your ship was in
a disgraceful condition.  With all hands drunk, did you think to keep
fast two men of strength and intelligence?"

"Drunk or sober, we were promised them," asserted Flint, a trifle
less belligerently.  "And sure, ye could ha' turned 'em back to
us--not that that will do me any good for the two men they killed,
they or whoever helped 'em to break from the _Walrus_."

"Nobody from the _Royal James_ assisted them," said Murray.  "You
have my word for that.  I can not say as much for your own ship,
although they told me when they discovered themselves to me, several
days after our sailing, that they had acted alone."

"Alone or not, where's my two men?" blustered Flint.  "Good hands
don't grow on trees."

"No; aboard the _Walrus_ they stab one another to death," agreed my
great-uncle.  "Come, come, you have no proof in support of your
charge."

"No proof?" howled Flint.  "These two broke out of my lazaret, and
the same night the two men on watch----"

My great-uncle raised his eyebrows.

"Tut, tut!  Really, now!  'Two men on watch!'  What would you have?
John Silver and Blind Pew could have escaped from such slender
guards, let alone two whole men, one of them the strongest ever I
knew."

"Well, two broke free and two died," insisted Flint.  "And if the two
who broke free were not the means----"

"What proof have you of it?"

"Proof?"

"Aye, proof, I said.  Their bodies, what of them?"

"Why, we never----"

My great-uncle shrugged his shoulders.

"You see?  You have been talking loosely, I fear, my friend.  But you
must suffer me to repeat that if you left your ship all night with a
watch of two men on deck you deserved to lose your hostages and the
lives of the watch.  At any rate, you'll not have my sympathy."

Flint's fingers twitched on his hanger-hilt.

"I tell ye, Murray, there's a foul smell about this whole business.
You were all for giving me hostages--'twas no idea of mine.  And then
they no sooner come aboard my ship than they're away again.  I like
it not.  Here's trickery or ye may gut me for a preacher."

"Had I found your hostages on the _James_ before sailing or within a
day after, you should have had them back again," said Murray firmly.
"But there is no point to this argument; for hostages or no hostages,
you see me returned with the treasure, as I promised."

"---- me, ye've been long enough gone," complained Flint.  "It hath
been a month more than ye promised."

"For that I had excellent reasons," answered my great-uncle.  "I was
chased twice on my way hither."

Flint was impressed by this--also, his eyes strayed, as if lured by a
magnet of irresistible power, back to the heap of treasure on the
deck below.

"Ye must ha' had rare success," he admitted unwillingly.  "We ha' the
gold o' the Indies here!"

He looked up and happened to meet the awe-struck gaze of Moira
O'Donnell.  A sneer curled his lips.

"But ye carry passengers, I see," he insinuated.  "Gold and women!
'Tis a fine combination, Murray, but there's a rule in our Articles
you were all for establishing.  Number Four, eh?  It sticks in my
crop, for ye called it once on me.

"'And that there may be less occasion for broils amongst our company,
we do further decree that gaming may be prohibited at any time when
in the captain's judgment it becomes dangerous to our harmony, as
likewise, that at no time and under no circumstances may women be
taken and kept as spoil aboard our vessels or any vessel upon which
our company may chance to fare.'

"What d'ye say to that?  What of Rule Four now?"

"I wish it was observed as strictly aboard the _Walrus_ as on the
_Royal James_" returned Murray.  "As to gaming, it seems that you
allow your crew full license."

"I'll govern my own ship," responded Flint sourly.  "Ye ha' yet to
answer my questions."

My great-uncle took snuff.

"This lady," he said, with the slightest emphasis, "is the daughter
of my friend here, Colonel O'Donnell, a gentleman who represents in
our venture the group of my friends who made it possible for me to
intercept the treasure-ship."

O'Donnell, whose face had been growing redder and redder throughout
this conversation, plucked his daughter by the elbow and led her away.

"I'll be thanking ye to let me know when the time comes there's an
end o' mangy curs in these parts," he remarked over his shoulder.
"'Tis not to be hearing my daughter insulted and my own self
explained to the scum of the sea that I'll be standing quiet and idle
in front of as----"

"Peace, _chevalier_!" interrupted Murray, and there was a ring in his
voice that compelled obedience.

Flint's blue jowl took on a sickly greenish pallor and the tiny veins
over his cheekbones commenced to beat.

"---- me for a ---- ---- ---- if I'll stand for such from any
sneaking, longjawed, Irish Papist ----"

"That will do," said my great-uncle without raising his voice.

Flint subsided.

"Colonel O'Donnell and his daughter are my guests," my great-uncle
continued.  "They have played essential parts in our capture of the
treasure.  I must insist, Flint, that you accord them a courtesy
similar to that which I should extend to friends of yours in a like
situation."

"They're no friends o' mine," growled Flint.  "This is more o' your
cursed political blethering.  Well, I'm sick o' it, Murray, and I
care not who knows it.  First, ye carry us north to America, just to
crimp two men, with not two hundred pounds in booty to show for the
voyage.  Next, ye shut me up here for the better part of six months
for my men to rot with fever and drink and my ship to foul her
bottom----"

"On both these counts you have your own negligence to blame," put in
my great-uncle.

"--and last," Flint fumed on without heeding him, "ye bring to the
Rendeyvoo a man and a woman who are not of our company, and who, for
all ye know, may go hence, and loose a King's ship on us some day
when we are careened and helpless."

"Not you," returned Murray sarcastically.  "You'll not careen, Flint.
That would mean work for your crew.  But you concern yourself
needlessly.  Colonel O'Donnell has reasons for keeping his share in
our enterprise under cover.  He is more safely to be trusted in the
circumstances than many another."

"I care not who he is or what you may have on him," cried Flint,
working himself into a fury.  "Ye ha' introduced four strangers into
our midst without the let or permission of others of our company."

"I do not recognize the right of any other to tell me what I shall or
shall not do," replied my great-uncle haughtily.  "Such as it is,
this company is the creation of my efforts, and I venture the
assertion, Captain Flint, that it will not long survive my
leadership.  The four strangers of whom you complain have been
essential factors in enabling me to win the treasure before
you--which now awaits your convenience for division, according to the
terms I originally stipulated."

If Murray's last words were intended to stimulate Flint's cupidity
anew they succeeded.  The captain of the _Walrus_ opened his mouth to
shout defiance, then let his eyes wander again to the pile under the
break of the poop.

"How--how much?" he asked, almost fearfully.

"Seven hundred and sixty-three thousand, nine hundred and ninety-five
pounds in coin and bullion, without counting a chest of jewels and
three chests of plate," replied my great-uncle promptly.  "You will
note that I have favored our people in the division, allotting to
them all in excess of the million and a half pounds the _Santissima
Trinidad_ was expected to carry."

A cunning look crept into Flint's face.

"Where's the rest?" he croaked.

My great-uncle took snuff.

"Quite safely disposed of, I assure you," he answered.

"Down below?"

"No, 'tis no longer aboard."

Flint swallowed hard.

"Ye mean it ain't here?  It ain't aboard the _James_?"

"Precisely, captain."

"Gut me!" roared Flint.  "Ye divided it by your lone?  Wi'out a man
from the _Walrus_ to stand by and see fair play?  I'll not support
it, Murray.  Curse me if I will!"

My great-uncle tapped his snuff-box.

"Your suspicions are quite unnecessary," he said.  "Had I intended to
defraud you, be sure I would not have enlarged the sum intended for
division betwixt the two ships by sixty-three thousand pounds and
more.  Indeed, figuring in the jewels and plate, there must be an
excess of better than one hundred thousand pounds."

"I know your tricks!" yelled Flint.  "May I be ---- ---- for a ----
---- ---- if any lousy swab of a sea-lawyer politician is a-goin' to
cast dust in my eyes.  'Twould be the very thing you'd do, Murray, to
attempt to cozen me into believing seven hundred thousand pounds had
been set aside for your 'friends' by throwing in an extra hundred
thousand pounds for our division.  'Friends!'  By thunder, the only
friend ye know is yourself, ye dried-up wisp of a ----"

"That will do," said my great-uncle in his still, level voice.

Flint opened and shut his mouth rapidly without a sound issuing forth.

"I bar personalities, captain," warned my redoubtable relative.

One hand barely touched his sword-hilt.

"I trust there will be no occasion for me to repeat the warning," he
remarked.

Flint's baffled rage was comic to behold.

"Aye, you and your fine gentleman ways!" he choked.  "I know ye!  Gut
me if I'll support it to be swindled thus.  A woman and strangers
aboard!  And eight hundred thousand pounds missing!  'Safely disposed
of,' says you!  I'll warrant.  Safe where you can collar it any time
you please.  I knowed it as soon as I marked the flutter of a
petticoat.  A woman and gold----"

Long John Silver swung himself up on to the poop from the head of the
port ladder and stamped toward us.

"Beggin' your pardon, Cap'n Murray, sir!"  His pleasant voice broke
through Flint's diatribe.

"My duty, Master Ormerod.  And Master Corlaer, too.  Like old times,
ain't it, gentlemen, all of us together?  I hopes as how ye'll
overlook my boldness, Cap'n Murray, but I ha' a word to speak to
Cap'n Flint--fo'csle council, sir."

My great-uncle took another pinch of snuff.

"Ah, yes," he observed drily.  "I recall that aboard the _Walrus_ the
fo'csle council must be heard.  I trust that you can instil some
common sense into your captain's head.  He hath need of it, Silver."

Flint glared, but Silver snatched whatever reply he intended out of
his mouth.

"Thank 'ee, sir.  You just let me an' Cap'n Flint ha' a word in
private, and maybe we'll see a way out o' this tangle."

"Suit yourself," said my great-uncle with a shrug.

Silver pulled his forelock, and his large face lighted up as if a
considerable favor had been conferred.

"We won't be no time at all, sir.  Thank 'ee kindly."

He put his free hand under Flint's elbow, and I marveled to see the
ease with which he was able to bend his captain to his will.
Accustomed as I was to Murray's autocratic discipline, it was a
revelation to establish contact again with the free-and-easy spirit
of the _Walrus_, where any man might become commander if he was able
to muster a majority of the fo'csle to raise cutlasses in his behalf.
Flint obediently followed his quartermaster to the sta'b'd side of
the poop, and there they laid their heads close and collogued for a
quarter-glass, Silver at first arguing and Flint resisting him.

"Silver is no man to let hard on four hundred thousand pounds slip
through his hands," I said.

"Andt maybe he says not to let eight hundred thousand pounds get
away, needer," commented Peter.  "_Ja_, I t'ink so."

Murray nodded slowly.

"You are more like to be right than wrong, friend Peter.  Of all the
_Walrus'_ people he hath the most acute intelligence.  A choice
knave!"

Colonel O'Donnell stalked back to us from the extremity of the stern
with Moira on his arm.

"Did ye put a flea in the rascal's ear, Murray?" he demanded.  "By
the Mass, I never thought to hear ye tolerate such impudence on your
own deck."

"I am no man for quarreling without an adequate end in sight,"
returned my great-uncle.  "Never threaten unless you must,
_chevalier_, and then smite with a sure aim."

"Words!" grumbled the Irishman.  "'Tis time we had a little action."

Moira disengaged herself from her father and came to stand betwixt
Peter and me.

"If there's to be more fighting," says she, "I will have a pistol and
cutlass and do my share.  I'll not stand idly by to be shot at the
way I was on the _Santissima Trinidad_--more by reason that if I must
sail with pirates I'll be preferring Captain Murray to the fellow
yonder in the red coat."

There was a high gallantry about her that drew a chuckle even from
Peter.

"Some time I take you to der wilderness country, andt we shoot us
bears andt scalp Injuns," he promised.

She clasped her hands.

"I am all for that, Peter," she cried.  "Sure, I'd sooner fight
Indians than pirates.  But see, Bob!  There's the red-headed boy will
be making signals to you from the larboard ladder."

Darby McGraw's flaming top-knot projected just far enough above the
level of the deck to show his eyes and a hand that jerked
mysteriously at me.

"Come up, Darby," I invited him.

But he shook his head vigorously, so I crossed to his side.

"What is ailing you?" I asked.

"Sorra a trouble in the whole of creation," he returned in his rich
brogue.  "But I'd walk my two feet over the galley-stove as soon as
stand so near the old devil as yourself, Master Bob.  My troth, he's
the terrible cruel feller, and him that ancient old he'd oughter been
waked these many years past."

"He's no more to be feared than Flint," I answered, laughing.

"Ah, there's little ye know to be saying the like of that!" exclaimed
Darby.  "With Flint 'tis a blow and a curse and 'take it or leave
it!'  But him!  He'd put the evil eye on the lot of us if the notion
but came into the head of him."

"I rather be his friend than his enemy," I admitted.  "Do they fear
him so aboard the _Walrus_?"

Darby squinted sideways at me.

"Whiles they fear him.  And then again when the rum is flowing--  But
I'll be saying what maybe I'll be sorry for later.  I see ye found
the elegant young maid that went to the Whale's Head with ye.  My
faith, ain't she the pretty creature!  Will she be a pirate, too?"

"No more than Peter and me."

"Do ye tell me that same!  And ye took her along with the treasure,
the lads do be saying below.  That was the grand haul!  But they say,
too, a good half of it ye buried on that island Long John do be
always singing about."

"So you have heard that!" I cried.

"Troth, yes.  They was telling Long John and me before he come up to
speak with Cap'n Flint.  God save us, who'd think there was so much
money in the world?  But here comes John and the cap'n now.  I'd
better be skippin'."

He slid down the ladder as he spoke, and I rejoined the group about
my great-uncle.  Flint strode across the deck, his face like a
thunder-cloud.  Silver, at his elbow, exhibited a countenance
wreathed in smiles.

"We'll divide what's below," said Flint abruptly.

"I rejoice that you have come to your senses," replied Murray.

Silver spoke up.

"He's a main jealous cap'n, Cap'n Flint is, sir.  Allus has a lookout
for the interests o' his crew.  A kind o' gardeen for us, ye might
say.  But we're all mighty beholden to yourself for counting in the
_Walrus_ same as the _James_; and speakin' on behalf o' the _Walrus_,
I make bold to say as we won't forget it, Cap'n Murray, sir."

My great-uncle listened to this with the shadow of a smile on his
face.

"I thank you, Silver," he acknowledged blandly.  "I was confident you
would appreciate the situation.  Will you divide at once, Flint?"

Flint growled in his throat, then mastered his temper by a
substantial effort.

"We'll appoint the usual committee o' six to check over with your
men, Murray," he rasped.  "I'll send my boats to shift our portion."

And he turned on his heel.  John Silver pulled his forelock and
nodded to all of us.

"Thank 'ee kindly, Cap'n Murray.  My duty, sirs.  And the young lady.
Mighty nice to ha' a sweet, pretty face in the cabin, ain't it?
Well, gentlemen, there's no excuse now for any o' us if we don't go
home and make them happy as we left for the sea."

"Not the slightest," agreed my great-uncle.  "I take it you are
returning to your dear old mother, Silver--or is it your fondly
waiting wife?"

Silver grinned.

"'Tain't neither, sir.  But there's a sightly gal in St. Pierre in
Martinico as I could set up shop with.  A bit o' color in her, but
then----"

He swept his arm in a liberal gesture as he stumped off to the ladder
and hopped lightly down to the maindeck after his commander.




CHAPTER XVI

TREACHERY

The candles burned with a steady, spear-shaped flame, undeviating,
motionless, so that the shadows were cast upon the paneling of the
cabin walls in solid blocks like streaks of a darker coloring in the
polished woodwork.  The air was so still that we could hear the
sea-birds calling down the inlet, the seethe and suck of water about
the rudder, the splash of a fish, the patter of the feet of the watch.

Mistress O'Donnell had retired to her stateroom, with the appearance
of the wine, for both her father and Murray held punctiliously to the
polite usage of society in this respect, Colonel O'Donnell, I think,
because he dreaded lest she should witness one of his periodical
bouts when he would saturate himself to a state of insensibility, and
Peter and I must carry him to his berth, as we had done the first
night he came aboard the _Royal James_.

My great uncle, for want of other diversion, had undertaken to teach
Peter to play chess, with some saturnine advice and comment from the
Irishman; and to my amusement--as likewise to Murray's, I must
admit--Peter proved himself a most redoubtable tyro, and once he had
been coached in the rudiments presented a shrewd defensive gambit.

"Check at last!" exclaimed my relative, sinking back in his chair--of
the four of us, he alone wore coat and stock and still contrived to
maintain an air of cool well-being in that humid atmosphere.  "You
pushed me, Peter.  Stap me, but you did!  I'd not like to match my
game with yours six months from now.  Had you developed your queen's
knight eight moves back--  But 'tis futile to argue concerning what
might have been.  As well seek to prognosticate the future of our own
lives."

Peter giggled and muttered that he was "no goodt, _neen_."

"I would we might say, 'Check!' in this weary coil we are caught in,"
grumbled O'Donnell.  "I see not that we are any farther forward with
your confederates yonder."

He waved his hand out of the stern-window.

"They carried away their four hundred thousand pounds, but every man
of them was as glum in the face as though 'twas so many bodeens
instead of a prince's ransom.  St. Patrick!  When I think of what
four hundred thousand pounds would do with the English Parliamentmen
that will be selling their souls to whoever bids them the highest!"

"We have paid a price, _chevalier_," returned my great-uncle.  "If we
receive what we purchased, well and good.  If not----"

He spread out his hands in deprecation.

"I am bound to concede, however, that I do not augur the best from
what little information we have to go upon.  Have you noted,
gentlemen, that still as is the night, we hear no sounds of carousing
aboard the _Walrus_?"

'Twas true, and had been true since the last boatload of treasure was
transferred to Flint's ship shortly after dusk.

"You think he will fight then?" I asked from my seat under the stern
windows, whence I could see the lights of the _Walrus_, dimly yellow
in the thick, velvety, tropic darkness.

"I hope he will fight, my dear nephew," my great-uncle corrected me.
"I fear Captain Flint has outlived his usefulness to me, and if my
fears are well founded, the sooner we can smash him the better I
shall be pleased.  But I make it a rule never to think on the
possibilities of the future.  Rather I prepare for whatever
eventualities may arise and let it go at that."

"And are ye prepared tonight for treachery if this fellow Flint will
be turning upon ye?" demanded O'Donnell.

Murray indulged himself with a pinch of snuff.

"Within reason, _chevalier_, yes.  We have a strict watch, and the
battery hath been cast loose and provided.  More I can not do.  The
one advantage which Flint possesses is that I must wait upon whatever
line of conduct he devises or his crew dictate to him."

The Irishman downed a goblet of brandy in a single gulp.

"Bah!" he cried.  "'Tis easy enough for you to be talking the like of
that.  But I tell ye I am thinking we'd maybe better choose the now
whether we'll push the fighting to Flint or pass out to sea."

My great-uncle shook his head.

"That would be poor tactics, either way.  A fight means loss of life
and ship damage, and if it can be avoided without loss we are by so
much the gainer.  Also, the seas are dangerous for us, as you should
know, _chevalier_--and for another reason, Martin agrees with me the
weather is working up for a violent storm."

"St. Patrick aid us!" protested O'Donnell.  "I'm not able at all to
make out how ye stand, Murray, and that's the naked truth.  One
moment you're crying for a fight with Flint, and the next you say to
avoid it, if that can be managed."

"Quite true, _chevalier_," assented my great-uncle calmly.  "And I
fail to see that my position is a false one.  I prefer not to force
the issue.  My policy is summed up in that."

"But you don't know what der _Walrus_ will do, dat's der trouble,"
said Peter, looking up from the chessmen with which he had been
toying on the table-top.

"And that, too, I have admitted, friend Peter," answered Murray.

"One night Bob andt me swam in der water from der _Walrus_ to der
_James_," pursued Peter as if my great uncle had not spoken.  "Maybe
we could do dot again, _ja_."

"Ha!" cried O'Donnell, smiting the table with his fist.  "The very
thing."

But my great-uncle sat unmoved.

"It could be done!" I exclaimed.  "And none besides ourselves have
knowledge of it."

Murray's wonderful, tawny eyes settled upon my face.

"Aye, it could be done," he agreed.  "But there is danger, lad.  'Tis
a still night.  You can hear the fish leap."

"And Flint's people keep a slovenly watch," I replied.  "But Peter
and I are good swimmers.  We'll not make a sound."

Peter commenced to blow out the candles.

"_Ja_," he said.  "Me, I don't like der water when it makes waves,
but quiet it is nice."

My great-uncle smiled in the dwindling light.

"I should be a hypocrite as well as a fool, did I refuse your offer,
gentlemen," he said.  "'Tis not only our own lives are at stake, but
Mistress Moira's too."

A groan came from Colonel O'Donnell.

"Ah, didn't I tell ye the way we would be left to the mercy of your
cutthroats and latch-drawers, Murray?  And now 'tis yourself must
admit it!  A sorry business it is, and I wish to God I'd never heard
your name or gone forth of Spain."

Murray himself blew out the last candle.

"Well, well, _chevalier_," he answered a little tartly, "forth of
Spain you went, and aboard the _Royal James_ you are, and the one
hope of life you have is that you stay aboard the _Royal James_--and
this is saying naught of the obligations we owe to your friends on
the other side."

Peter's great bulk glided by us.

"I go get a rope," he squeaked.

"A rope!" hiccuped O'Donnell.  "And if we don't end in the noose of a
rope, we'll likely be walking the plank.  I care little for myself.
I'll have seen my life and had my fling.  But it was an ill day,
Murray, you prevailed on me to fetch Moira along.  I can't think what
was in your mind--a young maid in a pirate hold!  'Tis wicked past
belief."

"Tut, tut," remonstrated my great-uncle.  "My reasons were of the
best, and have been vindicated by events.  But here is Peter.  You
found the rope?"

"_Ja_," answered Peter, and knotted an end around a leg of the table
as I had done the night of our surreptitious entry.

O'Donnell sought solace in another glass of brandy.  Murray assisted
Peter and me to undress, and accompanied us to the stern windows.

"No needless risks, remember," he whispered as I crawled over the
sill.  "And above all, avoid discovery.  Better learn nothing than be
found out."

I had wrapped my ankles around the pendent rope and was prepared for
a cautious slide into the water when a faint chuckle escaped him.

"What is it?" I asked.

"I was but thinking what a sturdy pirate you are become."

He withdrew his head before I could answer, and I dropped into the
tepid water, with care that there should be no splash.  An instant
later Peter was beside me, and we began to swim with long, slow
strokes in the direction of the blobs of light which were the only
indication of the _Walrus_, so impalpable was the texture of that
breathless night.  There was not even a star in the sky--and the sky
itself was invisible.

The hull of the pirate ship did not take shape until we were under
the sheer of the stern.  A single, guttering lanthorn seemed to burn
in the main cabin, which was tenantless.  And we paralleled the
sta'b'd side, attracted by a hum of voices for'ard.

Peter's hand on my shoulder detained me as we swam beneath the heel
of the bowsprit.

"Here you climb oop," he breathed in my ear.  "They are all on her
deck.  I t'ink dey smoke der pipe in council, _ja_!"

I trod water, and explored with both arms above my head.

"There's no rope within reach," I told him.

"Dot's all right.  I lift you."

He was clutching the cutwater with both hands and bracing his feet
against the swell of the bow.

"Come on," he urged.  "Oop on to my shoulders.  I hold you, _ja_."

"But if we splash?"

"We don't splash.  You go oop; I go down under der water.  Dot's all."

I forged alongside of him and gingerly climbed his immense shoulders,
using a grip on his hair for haulage.  Then I reached overhead again,
and this time got my hands upon a stay of the bowsprit which ran from
midway of the spar to a turnbuckle on the bow.

"Steady," I whispered.  "I'm going to jump."

"_Ja!_"

I threw my legs upward and twined them around the stay, hanging like
a monkey from it, and Peter went under with a gurgling ripple which
might have been made by a fish.  Presently he came to the surface and
swam beneath me.

"Can you climb, Bob?"

"I think so."

"Goodt!  I waidt."

The stay was fortunately dry--had it been slippery-wet I could never
have swarmed it--and I was able, after much effort, to secure a grip
on the bowsprit and lift myself astraddle of it.  From here
ordinarily the deck should have been visible, but in that intense
darkness I could see no more than a vague loom of spars and a blur of
light in the waist.  The hum of voices was more audible, but still
indistinct.

I worked down the bowsprit to the lift of the bows; but still I could
see nothing, even on the fo'csle.  'Twas plain, however, that here
was no watch to fear, and I dropped to the deck and crawled aft on my
hands and knees toward the hum of talk, which I made certain now came
from the waist.

The fo'csle was littered with spare cables, water-casks and other
sailor's truck, which I had to avoid displacing; but I had my reward,
for as I advanced the hum of voices dissolved into words and phrases.

--"a foxy 'un, Murray is," said a seaman's voice.

"And they _James_ fellers'll fight us, whatever 'ee say," added a
second.

"O' course they will!"

This was Silver's unmistakable oily speech.

"Who wouldn't fight for the grandest fortune as any gentlemen
adventurers ever had a chance at?"

I wriggled behind a chase-gun, and peered over its breech into the
waist.  Two battle-lanthorns were suspended from the mainyard, and
their yellow glare revealed the _Walrus'_ crew squatted in serried
ranks around the butt of the mainmast, where Flint, Bones, Silver and
several others sat on upturned rum-barrels.

Flint leaned forward, wrathfully insistent, as I propped myself
against a trunnion.

"Gut me if I thought to find such skulkers in my crew!" he snarled.
"D'ye think to take any prize wi'out loss?"

"Aye," said a third seaman doggedly, "but we ha' never yet fought wi'
Murray.  Them as does don't ha' luck."

A murmur of assent answered him.

"Ah," struck in Silver, "but there's a first time always, mates.
Murray's like the rest o' us.  A ball or a cutlass-edge will finish
him.  And I say again, who wouldn't risk death for more'n a million
and a half o' pounds in good gold and hard silver as'll buy every man
jack o' us such pleasures as few men ever comes by, mates?"

"But there's only as much aboard the _James_ as we ha' here,"
objected one of the first speakers.

"True for you, Tom Allardyce," said Flint.  "But the rest's safe
enough, ain't it?"

"There's only them few knows o' it," returned the man.  "They said on
the _James_ there was but the three men and the girl was landed to
bury it."

Flint's answering laugh was horrible.

"And d'ye think that out o' four people, not countin' Murray--and one
o' the four a girl--we can't make one talk?  I tell ye, Tom, the
stuff is as good as divided."

"Ye ha' first to catch Murray," retorted Allardyce.

"And why won't we?" demanded Silver.  "Didn't we take what he was
ready to give us and thank him for it like blessed lambs?  And if he
does suspect, what good'll it do him?  On a night like this he'll
never know where we are until we're on him.  Two good broadsides, and
then we'll sweep his decks."

Nobody spoke for a time.

"When does the ebb make?" asked Flint with a stretch and a yawn.

"Another two glasses yet," said Bones.

"----, I must ha' a bit of sleep," growled the pirates' captain.
"Come to a vote, lads, and be done wi' it.  Will, ye go or won't ye?
Ye all know what mercy Murray'll give ye, if he ever hears o' this
council--and there's them, as would like to blab, be sure o' that."

Silver pulled himself erect, cuddling his crutch under his.  arm.

"Quartermaster speaks for the crew," he said.  "And my view is as how
the crew is for fightin' for their just rights.  The _Walrus_ has
played second fiddle long enough, and here's a chance as isn't likely
to come again."

There was a second brief interval of silence.

"Nobody contrary," announced the one-legged man cheerfully.
"Council's over!  Keep quiet, mates.  No drinkin', no fightin'.
There'll be plenty o' both later."

The squatting ranks broke up into groups, and a number of men
strolled for'ard toward my hiding-place.  But I did not await them.
From the shelter of the chase-gun I hunched myself back behind a
water-cask, and so regained the bows, slipped overside and slid down
the anchor-cable to the water.

A huge white shape floated up to me.

"Is dot you, Bob?"

"Yes.  They're for attacking the _James_ when the tide turns."

He headed down-stream without a word.  We were half-way to the
_James_ before he spoke.

"Dot Murray, he is a lucky feller.  Always he gets what he wants."

"What does he want?" I panted.

"Now he gets rid of Flint andt der _Walrus_ crew, _ja_."

"But he'll lose their half of the treasure if----"

"Maybe; maybe he don't.  Andt after dot he gets rid of der _James_."

"You're crazy, Peter," I said indignantly, trying my best to keep
pace with him.  "He'd be stranded here."

"Oh, he don't do dot here--maybe he don't do dot at all; maybe der
tdefil stops helping him, _ja_.  But if he gets der chance, you watch
him, Bob.  He gets rid of der _James_, and maybe he gets rid of us,
ja."

"Well, why do we help him, then?" I snapped, recalling my
great-uncle's parting gibe.

"Dot's where he is smart, Bob.  He makes it so we got to help him to
safe our own skins, ja.  Andt der little gal, too.  For him and der
Irisher dot drinks like a Lenape squaw I ain't got no use.  But you
andt der little gal--dot's different."

"Do you mean he intends to sacrifice all of us?  And carry away the
whole treasure for himself?"

"I don't know, Bob.  Murray, he is a funny feller.  Very funny!  He
likes you.  He likes der little gal.  Maybe he likes me--I don't
know.  Andt he is honest about dot oldt king dot lifs in Rome.  But
if any of us come in his way, he would push us aside.  Dot's him now!"

The stern of the _Royal James_ rose before us, and in one of the open
windows my great-uncle's fine white head showed like a faded picture
in a frame seen across a darkened room.

"Once before he planned too big," Peter whispered on.  "Maybe this
time Gott speaks loud to der tdefil andt stops him."

My great-uncle's voice floated down, quietly distinct.

"They are gone overlong.  Gadzooks, _chevalier_, if they do not
shortly return I'll slip my cable and take advantage of what remains
of the flood to come at the _Walrus_ and finish matters off-hand."

O'Donnell's reply was simply a querulous echo from the interior of
the cabin.

"That sounds as though he had some use for us," I murmured to Peter,
noiselessly treading water beside me.

"_Ja_.  Use he has for us.  Maybe he needs us when he gets rid of der
_James_, eh?  If der tdefil fails him, he can have use for honest
men, Bob."

"We'll soon know," I retorted, and twitched the rope which dangled by
the rudder-post.

"Who is there?" challenged my great-uncle, instantly alert.

"Robert," I whispered back, and commenced to climb.

Both Murray and O'Donnell--the latter for the time being stirred out
of his habitual gloom--assisted me over the window-sill, and it
affected me oddly to note my great-uncle's unconcern for the water I
dripped on his silken coat.

"You ha' suffered no hurt?" he asked eagerly.

"No, no," I answered.  "Make haste to help Peter up.  They are coming
against us with the making of the ebb."

He was betwixt me and the window, and I could see the faint smile of
satisfaction on his face.

"'Tis what was to be expected of them," he remarked.  "We must
improve our watch.  'Tis no compliment to our people that they failed
to suspect aught of your going and coming."

Peter squattered into the cabin like an enormous toad.

"Oof!" he squeaked.  "I haf bubbles under my skin.  We haf a fight
tonight, Murray, _ja_?"

"Thanks to you and Robert, friend Peter, 'twill be rather in the
nature of a chastisement than a fight," he answered urbanely.  "If
you will pardon me, gentlemen, I will go and complete the necessary
arrangements."

A tinkle of glass told me that O'Donnell was refilling his goblet.

"What's a fight to the likes of him?" muttered the Irishman
dolefully.  "Treachery and scheming and murdering, aye, it's a fine
night for such!  Oh, blessed saints, where'll we be this time the
morrow?"

"Safe, beyond question," I sought to encourage him as I drew on my
breeches.  "'Tis never the _Walrus'_ scaly crew will overcome us."

"Be not too sure, Master Ormerod," he retorted with unusual
vehemence.  "I am thinking there is the curse of high Heaven on this
venture and all connected with it."

Nevertheless he buckled on his sword and accompanied us to the deck
when we were dressed.  Men were scurrying silently to and fro, and
from an open hatch came the whine of tackle as a piece was shifted on
the gundeck.  Aloft, squads of topmen were unfurling shreds of canvas
to give the _James_ steerage way at need.  On the poop my great-uncle
was issuing his final orders to Martin, Saunders and Coupeau.

"You, Saunders," he said, "will stand by the anchor-cable with a
broad-ax and upon my giving the word hew it asunder.  Your position,
Martin, will be in the waist.  Keep men on the fore and main yards,
ready to make sail when the cable is cut.  Coupeau, of you I expect
an initial broadside of crushing effect and a second fire if
circumstances permit.  Now to your stations, and above all things
instruct your men to preserve silence.  The man who makes a noise I
will blow from a gun forthwith, and let that be my declaration to
Flint!"

The officers gave their acknowledgments and flitted away.
Simultaneously Peter pointed up the inlet.

"See!" he exclaimed.

The _Walrus'_ riding-light winked out.  An interval of minutes, and
one of the waist-lights followed it.  Another interval, and she
disappeared completely in the black maw of the night.

My great-uncle sneezed delicately.

"In the dark one is clumsy," he observed.  "I fear I have abused my
nose with an over heavy dose of Rip-Rap.  Well, well!  Perhaps there
is a parable in the incident for such clever fellows as Captain Flint.

"I must ask you not to move about, gentlemen.  We have the better
part of a glass to wait for the ebb, but caution is our watchword!"




CHAPTER XVII

THE STORM

We heard the _Walrus_ before we had sight of her--the slatting of a
head-sail, a rattling block, a vague creak of cordage.  Then an
impression of a mighty shadow, a towering spiderweb of spars and lacy
rigging, stealing ghost-like from the enshrouding dark.

She floated nearer.  Nearer still.  And nearer.  It seemed that the
two vessels must collide, and the suspense became unbearable.  I
wondered at my great-uncle's restraint.  Would he never--I gasped
with relief as his cool, even tones clove the silence.

"Touch off, Coupeau."

Crash!  The deck leaped underfoot; the anchored hull surged forward.
A red sheet of flame girdled the _James'_ side, and in the instant's
glare the _Walrus_ was revealed in stark detail against a setting of
glittering, black water and low, forested shores.  I saw a man in her
foretop, aimlessly balancing a grenade.  I saw men staring curiously
from the gunports as our broadside smashed into them.  I had a
glimpse of the brutal face of Bones, peering over the bulwarks, a
cutlass in his teeth.

The darkness returned, and a multitude of echoes dinned back and
forth across the inlet.  There was a rending and cracking of timbers,
with such screams as I never hope to hear again, the screams of
wicked men who face an unexpected death, oaths and blasphemy and
piteous appeals, all blended into one terrible, heart-searching whole.

My great-uncle's level voice dominated the confusion as easily as it
had the silence.

"Cut your cable, Saunders!"

Flint's bellow answered from the _Walrus_.

"Give it to 'em, ye cowardly swabs!  Stand to your guns!"

The red tongues of the _Walrus'_ guns licked out at us; the
staggering roar of their discharging smote the night.  The fabric of
the _Royal James_ quivered and shook as the iron hail lashed into
her.  A moaning and screeching rose from waist, fo'csle and gundeck:

"Oh, God!"

"My leg!  My leg!"

"It hurts!  Sweet Christ, how it----"

"They're out!  My guts are a-runnin' out!"

"Where's my arm?  Oh, God, where's my arm?"

But a third time my great-uncle mastered the uproar.

"Make sail, Martin!"

Coupeau had reloaded his guns, and the _James_ fired a second
broadside with the same crushing unanimity as before.  The _Walrus_
receded as if our fire had had the effect of physically repelling her
from us.  Clouds of smoke came between the ships, and I perceived
that we were benefiting from the severing of the anchor-cable.  The
ebb tide was already sweeping us down the Anchorage toward the open
sea.

The _Walrus_ shot off another ragged broadside, which for the most
part splashed water or scattered mud, and then settled to a pegging
chase, the Long Toms on her fo'csle barking fitfully as they tossed
the twelve-pound shot athwart our decks.  Our guns were silent.  Our
gundeck spewed forth men, whom Martin hustled to the yards to shake
out every sail to catch the errant wind that veered gustily from
southeast to southwest.

Colonel O'Donnell waved his fist at my great-uncle.

"What madness will have taken ye now, Murray?" he cried.  "There was
the grand chance ye had to finish the rascals once and for all.  Are
ye feared of them that ye turn tail--you that ha' struck first blow;
aye, and second, too?"

"Not at all, sir," rejoined my great-uncle.  "Having struck first
blow and second blow, as you so aptly phrase it, I am of a mind to
strike also the _coup de grace_.  And this with as trifling damage to
my own vessel as is possible."

"Man, you'll never have another such chance as that ye just cast
away," mourned the Irishman.

"For a soldier, _chevalier_, you reveal astonishing lack of
judgment," returned my great-uncle.  "Had I remained to finish
conclusions with Captain Flint in the narrow space of the anchorage I
might conceivably have gained the victory, but it must have been by
means of subordinating brains to brawn, and with loss in proportion
thereto.  I prefer to force him to sea, where, by maneuvering and
proper strategy, I can secure the same object at a half or a third of
the cost."

"'Tis all the same," retorted O'Donnell.  "If ye sink him, ye lose
his treasure."

"Quite true," assented Murray.  "But what would you say to driving
him ashore, eh?"

What O'Donnell would have answered to this I know not; for there was
a sudden drumming of feet on the deck, and Moira cast herself into
his arms.

"Oh, _padre_," she cried tearfully, "and are ye safe from the cannon?
I waked in my bed with their roaring, and it came over me we were on
the _Santissima Trinidad_ once more, and poor Señor Nunez, the
apothecary, groaning from his death-wound--and him that was looking
forward to the quiet end of his days in the little house by Alcantara!

"And then I was thinking 'twas all a horrid dream.  But the cannon
blatted again, and the ship trembled, and there was a shriek at my
very door.  So out I ran in my shift, and Diomede the blackamoor was
lying in his blood on the cabin floor, and Ben Gunn beside him
a-praying.  And with that I put on me enough clothing for decency's
sake, and came to find ye, for my four bones are clattering with
fear, and that's Heaven's truth!"

O'Donnell drew her close.

"There, there, acushla," he said with a tenderness he had only for
her.  "The worst will be over.  There's naught for ye to fear."

She reached up and stroked his face.

"Troth, and I was thinking that same if I could but come at you,
_padre_," says she.  "But 'tis terrible fearsome to be sleeping by
your lone self, and awake in the midst of a sea-fight."

Her father swore under his breath.

"Ah, 'tis I was the weak, foolish fellow to drag you into such a
venture!  There'll come a day I must answer----"

She stopped his mouth with her hand.

"As if I'd be anywhere else than just here!"

I turned my head, not wishing to be prying into their affairs, and a
quarter-mile astern I saw a jet of flame and heard the smacking
report of one of the _Walrus'_ chase-guns.

Moira said something more that I did not hear, and he interrupted her.

"Get ye below, my maid until we----"

There was a harsh, whistling sound in the air, and the hairs on one
side of my head rose up, and on the heels of this came the thud of a
shot as it struck timber.

"Close, egad!" commented my great-uncle.

O'Donnell swayed strangely and drooped over his daughter's shoulder.

"_Padre!_"  The dazed grief in her voice was tragical.  "Why won't ye
stand?  Are ye hit?  Oh, blessed Virgin, there's no sense left in
him!  Bob, Master Peter, help me!  He's so--so--heavy."

Peter and I jumped to aid her, and Murray was not far behind us.  We
lowered O'Donnell's tall body to the deck, and I ran for a lanthorn.
When I returned with it my great-uncle had assumed command of the
situation.

"We can feel no blood or broken bones," he said.  "Hold your light
here by his head, if you please, Robert."

The yellow glow played over the Irishman's long face.  His lips were
drawn back in what had been a smile; his eyes were fixed and glassy;
no pulse beat in his corded throat.  Moira crouched beside him,
chafing his limp hands and crooning a medley of endearments in
English, Irish and Spanish.  Murray, opposite her, thrust exploring
fingers into the bosom of her father's shirt.  A startled look
appeared in my great-uncle's lambent eyes, but his features preserved
their immobility.

"'Tis useless to cry to him, lass," he said gently.  "He doth not
answer, you see."

"But he will!" she protested.  "Sure, ye must soon be finding what is
wrong with him, sir.  It may be a sup of brandy would bring him
round."

My great-uncle reached across and plucked from her grasp the hand she
had been rubbing.

"Come," he said, rising, "we will ask Peter to carry him to his
berth, shall we?"

"But--but--we must bring him to!"

"We can not bring him to," he answered kindly.

She stood up, bewildered.

"Not--bring--him--to?  But why?"

"Because his heart no longer beats," said my great-uncle.  "Quick!
Catch her, Robert."

She lay like a tired child in my arms.

"Dead!" she murmured faintly.

"He can not be dead!" I exclaimed.  "There's not a wound on him."

"_Neen_," said Peter.

He picked up the lanthorn from where I had dropped it on the deck and
directed the light upon the upper part of Colonel O'Donnell's head.
A blue bruise like a scar was spread across the Irishman's left
temple.

"A graze-shot," pronounced Peter.  "Der cannonball came dot close.
_Ja_!"

"But the skin is not even broken," I objected.

"_Ja_, but dot don't matter."

Murray bent over and fingered the bruise.

"Peter is right," he said.  "'Twas the concussion affected the brain.
I have heard of such a freak shot, but never seen it happen before."

Moira clung to my arms.

"And he is really dead?  The _padre_ is really dead?  And he
unshriven, without a comfort of the Church!  Oh, holy saints, be his
advocates!  Sure, was there ever a crueler end?"

She collapsed in a passion of weeping.

"Conduct her below, Robert," said my great-uncle.  "We will follow
you."

She suffered me to lead her from the poop without objection, more
like a child than ever, sobbing and protesting and repeating the same
things over and over again, in an abandonment of grief which only the
Irish can attain.

"'Tis you are the kind friend," she stammered when we had reached her
stateroom, "And oh, Bob, I have the sore need of you, I that am an
orphan in a pirate ship.  Troth, I haven't a friend in the wide world
unless it be you and Master Corlaer.  But I am the bad, selfish girl
to be thinking of my own plight, and the father that loved me this
moment gone up to Peter's Gate, and him without the holy wafer to his
lips or so much as a prayer said over him.  Ah, what ill deed did we
do, either one of us, that he should be taken from me so, without a
word of parting?  The sisters were always after saying we must
reconcile ourselves to God's mercy, but 'tis little mercy has been
shown to me."

I quieted her at last, brought her a swallow of brandy and induced
her to lie down.

"I mustn't be crying the way I will have done," she apologized,
gulping her sobs.  "Himself will be needing all the prayers I can
say, and a boiling of candles, too.  Do you go on, Bob--only promise
you'll not leave me by my lone if there's more fighting.  I could
never stand to hear the thundering of the cannon
after--after--that--and no one by to bid me take heart o' grace."

The gray dawnlight was seeping through the stern windows when I
rejoined my great-uncle and Peter in the main cabin.  Peter was as
placid as ever, puffing industriously at a long clay pipe; but my
relative displayed more concern than I remembered to have observed in
him at any time in the past.

"I trust you were able to calm the poor lass?" he greeted me.  "Stap
me, what a sorry business!  I'd never have chosen O'Donnell for a
traveling companion, but without him I know not what to do.  The
whole venture----"

He shook his head and stared out the window beside him, clicking the
lid of his snuffbox open and shut.

"But we have first to attend to the _Walrus_," he added presently.
"I shall do so with the less reluctance after that last shot.  The
cursed luck of it!  A beaten enemy's blow in the dark, blindfolded,
by gad!  And to think it must strike down of all men the one most
essential to my schemes.  I could--  Well, well, no matter!  We must
triumph over the unexpected.  'Tis the chasm all great leaders must
cross to win the final victory."

I found myself somehow instinctively hostile to his attitude.

"What have you done with Colonel O'Donnell?" I asked coldly.

"Peter carried him to his stateroom.  We will give him decent burial
when we return to the island.  And perhaps some day we can come for
him in state with a squadron of King's ships and bear him home to a
grave in the land he was exiled from."

My great-uncle's spirits brightened noticeably as he contemplated the
picture his words presented.

"Yes, yes," he murmured half to himself.  "What O'Donnell could have
done surely I can do.  Our friends in Avignon will help.  And Robert!"

He turned to me.

"Ah, my boy, this unfortunate incident is my best justification for
pressing you in my cause.  What should I do without you and Peter?
'Twill be for you two, with Mistress Moira, to establish our
connections with the king's agents in France."

"You seem to forget I am no Jacobite," I answered unpleasantly.

"Tut, tut, you shall be as stout a Jacobite as Prince Charles
himself."

"Not I!"

He smiled.

"We'll leave that to Mistress Moira."

"Maybe you forget der _Walrus_," interposed Peter.

"Not so, Peter.  I shall dispose of the _Walrus_ within the next few
hours."

"Andt _Gott_," added Peter as if Murray had not spoken.

My great-uncle laughed merrily.

"My dear Peter, men of judgment will inform you that there is no
God--or, if we concede a God, there is every reason to assign a
superior degree of power to the inevitable Devil representing the
opposing virtue of godliness.  Indeed, did I incline to bow down
before any superhuman authority I should elect Satan by preference.
But a ripe experience has inclined me to the view that the Devil is
as much a figment of men's imaginations as God.  Since the beginning
of recorded time a priestly caste--  But here we are drifting into a
philosophical discussion; and as you very properly reminded me, the
_Walrus_ awaits our attention.  Let us go on deck."

"Der wise man don't know eferyt'ing," answered Peter.  "_Neen_!"

"Essentially true," agreed my great-uncle.  "I must confess myself
ignorant of such staple points as why we are here, the excuse for
human existence, the relative significance of this world of ours, the
utility of the differing qualities of goodness and evil.  But any
serious consideration, friend Peter, must convince as profound a
thinker as yourself that the very existence of men and women is of
itself prima-facie evidence that there can be no Divine Author of
omnipotent or sentient powers."

"We better go on deck," said Peter.

"After you," protested my relative as we rose.  "'Tis a pleasure to
debate with you, Peter.  Take care, pray!  Gunn has not removed all
of the evidence of Diomede's passing.  Strange, is it not, how a
black fellow like Diomede and a man who hath been the confidant of
princes like O'Donnell should both be abolished by a simple organic
disruption?  That alone, Peter, should suffice to disprove the humbug
of an all-wise Providence.  An all-wise Providence, forsooth!  Here
am I, arranging to reconstruct for the better a most unhappy trio of
kingdoms, with consequences bound to improve the well-being of the
entire world, and my plan is suffered to be placed in jeopardy by an
ignorant sailor's blind shot in the dark!  What could be more absurd?"

Peter did not answer him, and we passed out upon the maindeck, where
sailors were busy removing the traces of the _Walrus'_ first
broadside which had wrought a certain amount of minor damage and
caused the deaths of several men.  'Twas now light enough to see
about us, but the light was of a quality I had never known before--a
hard, coppery glare, with the sun obscured from view.  The sea was
quite flat, and the wind continued intermittent, veering from
one-quarter of the south to the other.  Spy-glass Island lay to
larboard, its contour amazingly distinct--as if it were bitten into
the frame of steel-blue sea and dully shimmering sky that encompassed
it.  The _Walrus_, like the _James_, had cleared Captain Kidd's
Anchorage, and was running due north before the wind betwixt us and
the islet called Skeleton Island.

Murray bent a shrewd eye aloft and hailed Martin.

"How is it you carry no sail on the mizzen?" he demanded.

"Account o' that there last ---- ---- ---- shot, cap'n," answered the
mate, tugging his forelock.  "If ye look to it ye'll see as how a
---- ---- twelve-pounder bored into her."

We all followed his pointing finger to a gouge beneath the mizzen
yard.  The shot that had grazed Colonel O'Donnell's head had done
more than graze the mizzen.  The mast was whittled away to a depth of
several inches as cleanly as if a giant's ax had chopped into it.

My great-uncle took snuff very slowly.

"What luck!  What luck!" he muttered.

And then louder:

"'Twas an expensive shot for us, gadzooks!  Well, Martin, we must
fish the mast at our earliest opportunity, but we can make shift to
corner Flint without it.  The _Walrus_ is foul and heavy in the
water.  The _James_ can sail circles round her in this wind."

There was a worried look in Martin's weather-beaten face.

"Askin' your pardon, sir, I don't like this ---- ---- wind.  We're in
for a ---- of a storm or I'm a ---- ---- ---- lubber."

My great-uncle shrugged his shoulders.

"Storm or no storm, Martin, the _Walrus_ carries nigh four hundred
thousand pounds."

"Aye, sir; and by your favor, best sink her and be done wi' it and
run for shelter."

"Sink her!  Man, we'd lose the treasure."

"Better lose the _Walrus'_ treasure than go down ourselves," insisted
Martin doggedly.  "Have it your own way, sir, but I'm a ---- ----
---- if it ain't fixin' to blow up one o' these here tarrible
Caribbee storms as pluck the hairs outn your head."

Murray regarded the four quarters of the sky for several moments.

"With your prognostications I find no quarrel, Martin," he said
finally; "but I believe we have ample time to head the _Walrus_.
Flint dares not run south because he knows the hornet's nest we have
stirred up in those seas.  My purpose is to box him in and force him
to beach.  If this wind continues we should bring him to book on the
north coast of the island, and so soon as the _Walrus_ has taken
ground we will wear and beat in for the North Inlet.  Doth that
satisfy you?"

The mate hesitated.

"You be cap'n, sir.  But if 'twas my say we'd head back in to the
Anchorage, _Walrus_ or no _Walrus_."

My great-uncle stiffened.

"'Tis impossible," he replied haughtily.  "However, we will bear up
for the _Walrus_, and you may bid Coupeau to see what harm he can
contrive against her with his chase-guns."

Martin saluted and went for'ard.  My great-uncle led us to the poop.

"Your old sailor is eke much of an old woman into the bargain," he
remarked perfunctorily, climbing the sta'b'd ladder ahead of me.
"Let him but sniff the approach of a tempest, and he is all for the
nearest haven--aye, the hardiest buccaneer no less than the
law-abiding merchantman."

"O'Donnell was right, it seems, when he advised you to finish the
task you had begun in the inlet," I snapped, none too pleased,
myself, with the outlook.

"In that case, my dear nephew, a half of us must have perished,"
retorted my relative.  "You have had some experience of these wolves
of ours when their lusts are roused.  No, no; I am no milk-and-water
fighter, but I prefer to batter my enemy safely at long range rather
than give him an equal opportunity to tear my throat."

Peter grunted.

"You said?" Murray inquired courteously.

"_Neen_, I saidt not'ings.  But I t'ink--I t'ink it is all right if
you get der _Walrus_ and yourself come safe.  If you don't do bot' it
don't matter if you do der odder; _neen_."

My great-uncle raised his prospect-glass.

"You have ably stated one of the primary rules of success in any
branch of warfare, friend Peter," he said.  "Captain Flint is making
better going of it than I had expected.  Apparently by some
perversity of our continuing ill-luck he hath a more constant wind
close under the island than we out here.  Ah!  I hear Coupeau's bark."

A cloud of smoke rolled aft as the long eighteen on the la'b'd side
of the lames' fo'csle boomed.  The shot dashed up a fountain of water
a few feet ahead of the _Walrus_, which was now running neck and neck
with us.  Flint replied with one of his long twelves, but the shot
fell short, and he edged away as much as he dared, which was very
little, for Murray had seen to it that he had bare sailing-room.  Our
chase-gun barked again, and this time the round shot ricocheted from
the water's surface and slapped into the _Walrus'_ hull.

"Neat," commented my great-uncle; "but what we require is a fair hit
on a spar."

Coupeau realized as much, as was evidenced by his next two shots
going high and striking the water beyond the target.  But I was
distracted from watching his efforts, for at the fifth discharge
Moira O'Donnell crept up the poop ladder, her eyes wide with
misgiving.

"Troth, yourself promised only a few minutes since you'd not leave me
by my lone was there more fighting, Bob," she reproached me.

"'Tis no fight," I answered.

"Aye, we do but seek to drive yonder knaves ashore," Murray assured
her.  "They can not reach us at this distance."

She surveyed the scene with a doubting eye and was constrained to
credit us.

"But why is the light so strange?" she demanded.  "'Tis as if the
door of a cookstove was ajar."

"We are in for bad weather, sweet," replied my great-uncle.  "You
must go below."

But she shrank away from him and clutched firmly an arm of Peter and
me, each.

"No, no, I'll not be going down there again," she cried.  "On the
inside of a door I can think of naught but the sorrow that is come
upon me.  I'll stay up here in the open."

"Certes, this will be no safe place in a storm," I urged.

But she clung the tighter to us.

"I'll not go down.  I'd sooner be taken by the pirates than go down.
Down there the noises of the water and the ship will be like the
crying of the banshee in the Green Room where grandfather died.  No,
no!  In the cabin there is only death, and the light is dim, and the
noises will be whispering at my elbow the livelong time.  I'll have
none of it!  Sure, I care not what danger there is, if I can stay up
here and meet it in the open."

"We let you stay," said Peter soothingly.  "_Ja_, we better let der
little gal stay, Murray.  Bob andt I, we take care of her."

"That will we," I endorsed him.

My great-uncle eyed me a thought quizzically.

"You are, it seems, subject to change of opinion, Robert," he
remarked.  "By all means let Moira remain with us.  I daresay she'll
be none the worse for a wetting."

But the storm held off throughout our morning-long chase down the
east coast of the island and then out to sea to herd the _Walrus_ in
from the north.  Coupeau hulled the miserable craft again and again,
and shot away her foretopmast; but she steadily clawed offshore and
made desperate attempts to steal ahead of us and win a clear path
before the wind, and when, toward noon, the breeze died completely
the positions of the two vessels were practically the same as they
had been from the beginning of the cat-and-mouse game that Murray
played.

The _Royal James_, by nimbler handling, had gained in the last hour,
and was more than a cannon-shot to the north-west of the _Walrus_,
with the northernmost of the island's chain of hills--the one the
pirates called the Foremast Hill--almost due southeast of us.  If the
wind sprang up again in anything like the same quarter the _Walrus_
was fast in Murray's trap.  She would have the choice of two
alternatives: She could stand on and fight, with the practical
certainty of destruction for all hands, or she could drive ashore, in
which case the crew might take to the woods, with every prospect of
eluding pursuit, unless Murray made a determined effort to comb the
island's craggy recesses.  After the long-range battering they had
received all morning, on top of the hammering in the action in the
dark, there was not much doubt that the _Walrus'_ disorderly crew
would take the decision into their own hands and choose the latter as
offering a fair chance of life, no matter how circumscribed.

The helmsman had just turned the hour-glass, which lay beside the
compass in the hooded box in front of the steering-wheel, when a
shout came from Martin, who was half-way up the main-rigging,
sweeping the horizon with a glass.  My great-uncle had been pondering
the desirability of getting out the boats and undertaking to tow the
_James_ within range of the long eighteens, and he called back--

"Is it wind?"

"Aye, aye, sir," roared Martin--and there was no mildness now in the
old fellow's tones.  "There's the ---- ----est blow o' wind as ever
came out o' the ---- ---- bowels o' the sky or I'm a ---- ---- swab
as ever was."

He tumbled from the ratlines and ran aft to the break of the poop,
his face lifted earnestly in appeal.

"Best let me lay an ax to the mizzen, sir," he called.

My great-uncle took snuff, calmly deliberate.

"Curb your fears, Martin," he answered.  "I have weathered a lifetime
of gales in the _Royal James_.  Take in sail, of course; but if we
sacrificed a mast needlessly 'twould cripple us for weeks.  Where
away is this wind?"

Martin waved an arm across the northwestern arc of the horizon.

"Look for yourself, cap'n.  I be an old man, and I never seed the
like."

Murray's reply was to swarm up the mizzen rigging with the uncanny
agility of which he was capable, and I climbed after him.  We were
some fifty feet above the deck when we saw clearly with the naked eye
a vast purple canopy arching forward across the northern sky, a thing
of splendidly colorful intensity, savagely beautiful.  Jagged streaks
of lightning flashed forth from its mirky depths.  A tattered fringe
of storm-clouds whipped out ahead of it like the tentacles of some
monstrous sea-creature.  And it advanced at an incredible speed,
covering miles of sea and sky in the few moments that we watched it.

My great-uncle's jaw squared grimly.

"'Tis too late to sacrifice the mizzen," he said.  "We'd not have
time to clear the wreckage."

His commands rang through the ship.

"Aloft, topmen!  Strip her to a storm-jib!  Hola, Coupeau!
Double-lash your chase-guns and be certain the broadside batteries
are secured and the ports closed.  Batten all hatches, Saunders!"

'Twas as much as I could do to keep pace with him as he descended to
the poop.

"Fetch a coil of light rope, Robert," he ordered briefly.  "We shall
all require to be lashed fast."

"Shall I carry Moira below?" I asked.

He hesitated.

"No, she will have a better chance----"

He checked himself.

"Let her bide on deck.  Here we can aid her at need.  Haste, boy!  We
must have the rope before the wind strikes us."

I slid down a stay to the maindeck and dug the rope out of a chest of
spare gear which was bolted to the cabin bulkhead.  My great-uncle's
last words had impressed me even more than the spectacle of that
baleful curtain across the northern sky; and I was thrilled, too, by
the tense celerity with which the entire crew leaped to the task of
preparing the ship to meet the tempest.  There was almost no noise--a
few shouts of command and hails of acknowledgment; but every man
worked as if his life depended upon it.  When the jib-sheet fouled
Martin slashed it free with his knife, and the sail came down with a
run.  By the time I had regained the poop the upper spars already
were bare.

Murray was standing with Moira and Peter beside the helmsman, and
while they stared, fascinated, at the oncoming storm, his eyes were
upon the _Walrus_.

"Flint must be sober," he said bitterly.  "He is taking in sail.
Stap me, what a fit end to a luckless day!  In the hollow of my hand,
and now--  Aye, 'twould be all ways fitting did he escape, whilst
we----"

A snarling moan, as of great winds tortured and confused, came to us
from the belly of the storm.  The sky darkened.  A gust of air,
sulfurous and warm, ruffled my hair.  The moan became a howl, a
clamor.

My great-uncle snatched the clasp-knife from the belt of the
helmsman, a splay-footed Easterling, whose flat, gap-toothed face had
remained impassive during all the excitement since Martin's warning
shout had announced the storm's approach.

"Give me that rope, Robert," he exclaimed.  "I am a fool to stand
talking.  Here, Peter!"

He flung the Dutchman a length of it.

"Bind Mistress Moira to those ringbolts--and best knot her to
yourself as well.  She'll not be able to stand alone.  Aid me with
this fellow here, Robert.  We must tie him to the wheel."

One of the clouds in advance of the storm curtain reached out over us
with a crackle of lightning-bolts and spatter of rain, and our
fingers flew as we secured first the helmsman and then ourselves.
The voice of the tempest was become a sullen, animal roar, riven at
intervals by the crash of the thunder.  And the immense curtain of
its front overhung the _James_, impenetrably sooty at the base,
opaquely purple as it toppled forward.  The _Walrus_ was a specter
ship to leeward, and disappeared in the gloom as I watched.

"Oh, holy Mother!" gasped Moira.  "'Twill be the end of all things."

And so it seemed.  The _Walrus_ was gone.  The northern coast of the
island dimmed and vanished.  For an instant the peak of Foremast Hill
hung in the upper air.  Then that, too, was blotted out.  The purple
twilight deepened.  Rain sheeted down from clouds scarce higher than
our mast-heads.  A lurid glare of lightning flickered and was
quenched in the sea.  And the wind smote us with a mad howl of
exultation, sucking up into its embrace everything that was not
fastened to the deck.

The _James_ shuddered under the blow, bearing down by the head and
heeling to starboard.  My great-uncle and I were pushed forward on
our faces.  The helmsman was doubled over the wheel.  Peter bent to
cover Moira, crouching above her on hands and knees.

Presently the ship righted herself; but as she neared an even keel
there was a prolonged _craa-aa-ack!_ of breaking wood, and the
wounded mizzenmast went by the board, crushing a score of men in its
fall and brushing as many more through the hole it stove in the
starboard bulwarks.

A wail of agony pierced thinly the tumult of the storm, and the
_James_ was jarred from end to end as the big spar, with all its
litter of yards and top-hamper, lunged at the hull like a
trip-hammer, its dead weight dragging us broadside on into the path
of the waves which followed the wind's first irresistible rush.
Steep walls of water dropped on us from as high as the mainyard,
thudding hollow on poop and fo'csle.  Giant combers crowded so fast
that we choked beneath their deluge.  The waist was a lather of
creamy seas that wrenched and battered at hatchcoamings and bulwarks.

Murray staggered to his feet and set his lips to my ear.

"Must--cut--free--mizzen--breach--hull----"

So much I understood, and assisted him to slash the rope which bound
us to the deck.  Peter saw what we were up to and loosed himself,
taking care in his deliberate fashion to strengthen Moira's lashings.
Then the three of us fought our way down into the hell-reek of the
waist, where small boats and water-butts and dead men swirled fore
and aft in a torrent of pounding seas.

There were axes in the box from which I had procured the rope, and we
equipped ourselves with them, waded thigh deep through the tangle of
water and wreckage and attacked the maze of stays and rigging that
united the dangling mizzenmast to the ship.  Not a man helped us.
There was not a living man in sight aft of the mainmast, and it was
as much as a man's life was worth to try to work aft of that point,
for on the one side there was a wide breach in the bulwarks through
which the waves poured, and opposite was the gap the mizzenmast had
crushed.  Whoever crossed the deck there must have been carried
overboard, one way or the other.

Where we were we had some slight shelter from the poop, but 'twas
sufficiently hazardous in all conscience.  I can see my great-uncle
still, in his black silk coat and breeches, all adrip with the salt
water as he labored with the energy of a man of half his age, always
swift to perceive the strategic center of the tangle, always first to
wade into the tricky web of cordage where a misstep meant a plunge
overside.

Twice Peter rescued him from certain death, and once the Dutchman
saved me when a mountainous sea curled down upon us over the _James'_
bulwarks and was like to have carried me off in its passing.  And it
was Peter whose brute strength and cool-headedness made the most of
my great-uncle's agility of wit, and hewed and hacked the mizzenmast
from its moorings.  Aye, and none too soon; for when we clambered
back on the poop Moira met us with hands clasped in terror and
pointed to leeward where a rocky headland loomed through the gray
rain.

Murray gave it one look and leaped for the wheel.  The Easterling was
bent over in the odd, huddled posture he had assumed from the moment
the storm hit us, and he lolled sidewise as my great-uncle grasped
his shoulder, his body all askew from the small of his back upward.
He made no response, and slipped lower in the coils of rope that
bound him to his post; his gnarled fingers slid off the spokes; his
feet went out from under him.

"His back is broken," shouted my great-uncle.

The _James_ had begun to gather headway; but as the wheel was
released from the dead helmsman's grip her head fell off, and she
dropped sluggishly into the trough of the seas which surged over the
shattered waist, and one green hill of water burst squarely on the
poop, hurling us to the deck.  Peter recovered his footing before
either Murray or I, shoved the Easterling's body aside and gripped
the wheel in his own hands.  Slowly, the buoyancy all out of her, the
_Royal James_ swung around in response to the rudder's thrust and
lumbered off before the wind.

The headland Moira had sighted faded into the mist; but my
great-uncle shook his head sadly.

"We are making water," he shouted to me; "and the island is to
leeward.  We scarce can weather it, and if we do----"

A faint hail reached us from the fo'csle.

"Land----"

And a rent in the storm-clouds showed a second and lower headland
fair over our larboard bow.

Peter started to put the helm down to enable us to bear off as much
as possible and have whatever chance there was of clearing it; but
Murray caught his arm.

"No, no, Peter!" cried my great-uncle.  "Head up!  Head up!  'Tis the
North Inlet!  If we can pass in to sta'b'd of that spit we are safe."

"_Ja_," squeaked Peter, and his iron muscles forced the rudder over
until it neutralized the drive of the wind and sea; and foot by foot
the _Royal James_ made her southing, passed the east spit with half a
cable's length to spare and opened a narrow, bottle-shaped roadstead,
with tree-clad shores that offered protection from any storm that
blew.

The rain was still pelting down.  The surf was foaming on the outer
beaches; the wind whistled shrilly in the rigging.  But to us that
prospect was the fairest ever seen.  Moira sank to her knees in
prayer beside the dead pirate.  My great-uncle stepped to the rail
and bade the survivors of the crew get sufficient sail on the ship to
give us steerage way.  And I--I tried to shake Peter.  He blinked at
me solemnly.

"I t'ink _Gott_ spoke out loudt to der tdefil today, Bob," he said.
"_Ja_!"




CHAPTER XVIII

DISASTER

Another less self-assured than Andrew Murray must have been dismayed
by the series of misfortunes which had beset him.  We were safe, but
no more.  The _Royal James_ was taking in water so rapidly 'twas
necessary to beach her on the mud-flats at the south end of the
inlet.  She leaked like a sieve where the mizzenmast had thumped her
side, and her upper works were in splinters.  In the fight with the
_Walrus_ and the storm we had lost eighty-odd men, but more serious
than this were the deaths of the two mates.  Martin's body was found
near the stump of the mizzen; he had been struck down by the mast he
so distrusted.  Nothing was ever seen of Saunders, and we could only
suppose that he had been swept overboard.

The crew were apathetic and sullen, inclined to be mutinous and
resentful of my great-uncle's authority.  For the first time they had
reason to question his omnipotence, and it required a full display of
his ruthless temper to reduce them to subjection--an accomplishment
to which he was aided considerably by Coupeau, and I am free to
admit, by Peter and me, who could not afford to risk the brutal
license which would certainly follow a successful revolt of the
gundeck's polyglot horde.  The former galley slave was a redoubtable
ally with the nine-tailed cat, and a bruiser whose fists were as
deadly sure as the long eighteens he handled so deftly.

The rain and wind ceased with the approach of darkness, and my
great-uncle had the men mustered under the poop, many of them still
bleeding from the punishment they had received.  And of all his feats
I deem that the most remarkable: To face, practically unaided, upward
of a hundred and fifty men, who had just been curbed in the act of
mutiny, without even sufficient light to enable him to exploit the
compelling gleam of his tawny eyes.  He beat them down--and held them
down--by sheer power of will and utter fearlessness.

"You stand upon the deck of a wrecked ship," he said bleakly.  "Under
hatches lies sufficient treasure to make every one of you comfortable
for life, to buy you dissipation or place or fortune, whichever you
prefer.  One man can lead you to repair the ship and conduct you
where the treasure will be of use to you.

"I am that man.  Without me you are doomed to spend your days chasing
the goats on those hills; and if there is any repetition of the
disorder exhibited today I shall maroon all of you save a number
required to handle the ship.

"Get to work.  Before you rest I expect the maindeck to be cleared
and stagings rigged overside for resheathing and calking."

He drove them until midnight, then sent them reeling to their
hammocks.

In the morning a systematic plan of occupation was arranged.  By
Coupeau's advice a handful of the more amenable of the crew--mostly
negroes, Portuguese, Italians and Frenchmen of the south--were
organized as an after-guard, and the remainder were divided into
squads headed by men selected for skill at some special trade.  One
squad were to overhaul the sails and cut and sew from spare canvas a
suit for the new mizzen, which a second squad were to hew on the
slopes of Spyglass Mountain and transport to the ship.  A third squad
were to repair all exterior damage to the hull; a fourth were to
recalk the started seams; a fifth were to attend to whatever internal
repairs were necessary.

Coupeau was placed in charge of the work aboardship, and the rest of
us carried Colonel O'Donnell's body to the top of a small hill east
of the head of the inlet.  There, in the midst of a grove of pines,
we laid him to rest.  'Twas a noble situation for a wanderer who had
never reached his goal, with the clashing boughs and the distant
thunder of the surf to sound a requiem until the end of time and a
view over green meadows and dwarf woodlands to the white rim of the
beach and the blue sea, shining in the sun.

Yesterday seemed years past.  I blinked my eyes, looking from the
peaceful garb of nature to Moira's slim body huddled in prayer beside
the mound of raw earth amongst the pine needles.  On the edge of the
grove the men who had dug the grave were playing a gambling game with
the pine-cones.  Peter leaned on a musket, gravely compassionate.  My
great-uncle, his eyes puckered in thought, was staring out to sea.
As I watched, he twitched my coat sleeve and drew me to one side.

"I shall leave you to amuse yourself as you choose for the remainder
of the day," he said.  "'Tis for you and Peter to safeguard the maid.
I must ascertain, if possible, what hath become of Flint."

"And then?" I asked.

"Then?"  His eyebrows arched in surprise.  "Why, then, Robert, we
shall continue as we have done hitherto."

"You must pursue this insane scheme?"

He was as patient with me as if I were a fractious child.

"'Tis no 'insane scheme,' but a coup of high politics of fascinating
import, my boy.  I own to disappointment it doth not appeal to you
more readily.  What?  Shall we cry quits, simply because of
shipwreck?  And after every move hath turned as we plotted it should!"

I shook my head hopelessly, but decided to try again.

"Bethink you," I argued, "the longboat can speedily be made weather
tight.  In her we might reach----"

"Put it from your mind," he interrupted with a hint of iron in his
voice.  "You little know me, Robert, if you reckon me one to turn
back from what I have begun--in especial, this matter which
consummates the ambition of my life."

"But we----"

This time the iron was uppermost.

"Boy, you are essential to my plans.  Much as I love you, I--  But
we'll not talk on that plane.  I am none for threats.  Let it suffice
that you are not to mention the subject again."

He wheeled around and left me, and with his escort of tarry-breeks
strung out behind him was soon buried in the undergrowth on the lower
flanks of the hill.

The sun was past meridian when Peter and I induced Moira to abandon
the unmarked mound, and to divert her mind we led her on a tramp to
the shoulders of the Spyglass, where a score of the _James'_ men
already had felled a giant fir and were lopping the branches from the
trunk preparatory to removing the bark.  In the forest near by we
killed a mess of birds, and Peter skilfully broiled them over an open
fire, and after that, since she professed to enjoy the silence of the
mountainside, we pressed on, beyond hearing of the ringing ax-blades,
and finally came to the foot of the steep pinnacle of rock which was
the lens of the Spyglass.

Here we would have halted, but Moira had heard the story of the watch
the pirates maintained from the summit, and she insisted on
completing the ascent, despite the lateness of the hour.  And we,
because we were for doing anything that would please her that day and
relieve her grief, consented.

It was more difficult than it looked, and the sun was low in the west
when we reached the platform at the top, stained and blackened by the
beacon fires that had burned there.  But the view was glorious.  The
island was spread out beneath us like a map on a table, from the
Foremast Hill on our left all the way southward along the rocky spine
of the west coast to Mizzenmast Hill and a cape to the west of that
which old Martin had called Haulbowline Head.  Eastward the irregular
shore ran north and south to the indentation of Captain Kidd's
Anchorage, the tree growth matted and thick except for several
savannas midway of the island and the silvery loops of two or three
small rivers.

We identified the masts of the _James_, rising above the headwaters
of the North Inlet, and the opening in the trees north and east of
Captain Kidd's Anchorage that was the site of the fort Flint had
built.  And then Moira cried out:

"Oh, blessed saints, will that be a ship?  Do but see, Bob!  Peter!"

She pointed eastward; and there, sure enough, was a ship, or rather,
the tops'ls of a ship barely lifting over the horizon's rim.  If it
had not been for the fact that the sun's rays were striking level
across the ocean floor, and so were reflected from the sheen of the
canvas, we should never have seen it, not even with a glass.

"Aye, 'tis a ship," I said.

"_Ja_," nodded Peter.  "It is Flint."

Moira shivered.

"Troth, and who would it be else?" she demanded.  "There'll be no
friends of us come a-calling, I'm thinking."

"It might be a King's ship--" I began.

"No, then," she denied, "if this island is gone all these years
without the King's ships finding track of it, 'tis not like they will
come upon it sudden in this moment."

"'Tis a ship indeed," I agreed unwillingly.  "Aye, a full-rigged
ship."

"_Ja_, a ship like Flint's," said Peter.

We were silent for an instant, the three of us, dazed by the
suddenness with which our whole outlook on the future had been
changed by this unexpected loom of tops'ls leagues away.

"He must have weathered the storm," I said foolishly.

"And now the red fighting will begin all over again," cried Moira.
"My soul, will there not have been deaths enough for this treasure?
Every piece of it must be specked with men's blood."

"We better tell Murray," said Peter, moving toward the lip of the
rock platform.

"But how could Flint be back so soon?" I protested.  "'Tis
impossible, Peter.  He could not----"

"He could, _ja_," returned the Dutchman imperturbably.  "Der storm
was by in two glasses--andt der ship is yet maybe ten leagues off,
_neen_?"

We descended the Spyglass in silence.  Twilight overtook us in the
forest at its base, and we were obliged to retrace our course with
extreme caution, so that eight bells rang from the _Royal James_--so
exact was the restored discipline on that stranded hulk--as we
stepped from the trees on to the shore of the North Inlet and hailed
for a boat.

My great-uncle met us at the gangway, immaculate in plum satin coat
and blue plush breeches, white silk stockings and black pumps,
silver-buckled, his hair neatly tied with a black silk ribbon.

"Well, well," he greeted us, "you have made a long day of it.  I
trust you are not overtired, sweet?"

This to Moira.

"I have delayed sitting to dinner in hopes that you would be here.
You can see--" he waved an all-inclusive hand--"that we have not been
idle aboard the _James_.  We begin to look like a ship again, eh?
Did you by chance see the new mizzen?"

"You better come to der cabin," said Peter abruptly.

"I beg your pardon?" answered Murray.

"We have something to tell you," I said.  "It can not wait."

His eyes plumbed mine, and I think he knew in that instant what our
news was.  He clicked open his snuff-box and dusted a pinch
delicately into his nostrils.

"So?" he murmured.  "Sets the wind in that quarter!"

And he offered Moira his arm with the fine, stately dignity he
achieved to perfection, and led the way aft to the main cabin.

"You may place the viands upon the table, Gunn," he said to the
steward when we were seated.  "We will serve ourselves."

He turned to Moira.

"I recommend this fish.  'Tis fresh-caught, and Scipio--" the
remaining blackamoor--"is a master at such dishes; he hath stuffed
it, you see, with greens he procured from the woods."

"We have scant time to eat, let alone to admire our food," I
interposed roughly.  "From the peak of the Spyglass at sunset we
sighted the tops'ls of a ship in the east."

"I presume that you believe her to be the _Walrus_?" he returned.

"_Ja_," said Peter.  "It is Flint."

"My faith, and who else would it?" asked Moira.

"Doubtless you are right," he assented.  "Indeed, I do not question
it.  Our examination of the northern and eastern beaches today failed
to disclose a trace of evidence to indicate what had become of the
_Walrus_, and had she sunk some wreckage must have washed ashore.
Yes, yes, my friends, our ill-luck is still with us.  Flint rode out
the storm.  But that, Robert, is no reason why we should not secure
the maximum of satisfaction from this tasty meal--all the more
particularly so when we consider 'tis like to be the last for some
days we shall eat in such comfortable surroundings."

"You take it coolly!" I exclaimed.

"And why not?  'Tis a disaster, I grant you, yet irritation will not
aid me to redress it."

"You don't stay here, _neen_?" said Peter.

"Quite right, friend Peter.  The _Royal James_ in her present plight
would be a death-trap.  I shall abandon her tonight and shift to the
fort Flint was so obliging as to construct for us by the anchorage."

"And the treasure?" I asked.

He held up his wineglass to the light and studied it reflectively.

"Obviously, we must be where the treasure is," he returned at length.
"Or, if you please, put it the other way round: The treasure must be
where we are.  I foresee a busy night for our people."

Moira thrust out appealing hands toward him.

"Oh, sir, why won't ye just be after calling out to this ship when
she comes and bid them take what they will and go?  Sure, that would
be better than----"

"Tut, tut," he rebuked her.  "A part of this treasure is to
supplement the eight hundred thousand pounds intended for your
father's friends--and they, my lass, are King James' friends.  You
are a good Jacobite, I trust, and would not see our Cause deprived of
a single doubloon that might buy muskets in Lyons or swordblades in
Breda?"

"Ah, 'tis little enough I feel for King James or any of them that
will have sent the _padre_ to his doom!" she cried.  "And what is a
Jacobite or a Hanoverian, or what worth King George or King James,
that you must be murdering and slaying and he that was a good man and
kind--when he wasn't in liquor--should lie in heathen ground?"

She leaped up, quivering with passion lashed aflame.

"Jacobite!  The toe of my boot to the word and them that use it!
Little enough hath it meant to me but poverty and exile and the death
of her that bore me and now--and now--the _padre_--and now----"

She fled from the cabin in tears, and her stateroom door slammed
after her.

"Poor lass!  Poor lass!" sighed my great-uncle.  "It hath been a
trying day for her.  We must be lenient."

"You should be down on your knees, beseeching her forgiveness, you
who wantonly dragged her into this danger!" I snarled at him.

"'Wantonly,' Robert?" he objected mildly.  "Certes, you should know
better by now.  My reasons were of the best, my motives of the
highest."

He rang the silver bell in front of him, and when Gunn appeared
said----

"Send Coupeau to me."

Then he turned to me again----

"You, of all persons, Robert, have least cause to censure me for
Mistress O'Donnell's presence."

"I have most!" I retorted hotly.  "I am so unfortunate as to be
related to you, and therefor must be in some measure a sharer of the
obloquy attached to your deeds."

He wagged his head sadly.

"Words!  What rash, unreasoning words will not youth sponsor in its
blind prejudices!  Peter, I appeal to you: Doth not my grandnephew
lie in my debt for my conduct in arranging for him the opportunity to
squire our little Irish maid?"

Peter drained a glass of brandy.

"You better not say any more, Murray," he grunted.  "_Neen_!  Maybe
you say too much."

"I had supposed myself the model of diplomacy," protested my
great-uncle.

Peter's little eyes twinkled behind their protective rolls of fat.

"_Ja_, you been pretty smart, Murray.  But der smart feller, he has
to look oudt or he gets too smart.  _Ja_!  Andt when he gets too
smart he is in trouble."

Coupeau's hideous mask of a face showed in the companionway entrance.

"_Oui, m'sieu_?" he growled.

"Ah, Coupeau," answered Murray.  "A strange sail approaches the
island, perhaps Flint, perhaps another.  To us it matters not.  We
must entrench ourselves ashore.  The treasure and sufficient stores
for two weeks' sojourn will be shifted to the stockaded fort on the
hill north of Captain Kidd's anchorage.  The men must work all night
again if necessary.  Do you understand?"

"_Oui, m'sieu_," replied the gunner.

"That is well.  You will rout them out at once."

"_Oui, m'sieu_."

And Coupeau clumped off down the companionway.  A moment later his
hoarse voice split the quiet of the ship as he commenced to bark his
orders.

"A stout fellow, Coupeau," commented my great-uncle.  "I have never
regretted the salvaging of him.  But perhaps it would be as well if
we went on deck and lent him moral support."

As a matter of fact, there was less disposition than we anticipated
on the part of the crew to object to this new labor.  And the reason
was not far to seek.  The transfer of the treasure to the fort by the
Anchorage furnished them an opportunity to establish an intimacy of
contact with it they had not known previously, an intimacy alluring,
stimulating, discomposing.  True, they already had transferred the
entire cargo of the _Santissima Trinidad_ once, had removed the half
of it from the _Royal James_ to the Dead Man's Chest, and only two
days since had broken out the remainder for division with the
_Walrus_.

But that was very different from shifting the squat, weighty, little
chests and kegs and the canvas-jacketed bars overland in the
darkness, along brush-paths dimly illuminated by occasional lanthorns
and torches, into a corner of the log block-house which was the
citadel of Flint's ramshackle fort--very different, too, from the
realization that the treasure's well-nigh fabulous wealth was outside
the charmed hull of the _Royal James_, where Murray's personality and
the arbitrary divisions of rank and intellect had reared an
insuperable barrier betwixt it and themselves, lying instead in a
promiscuous heap without a door to guard it, where any one of them
could gloat over its bright mysteries.

Peter and I, with Moira and Ben Gunn and Scipio, followed the main
column of the evacuation about midnight.  Coupeau had led the first
contingent, some of whom we met returning to the ship, to fetch a
second load of stores.  My great-uncle was to come after us with
these and the remainder of the crew, leaving behind on the _Royal
James_ only some twenty-odd men who had not yet recovered
sufficiently from wounds received in the two actions with the
_Santissima Trinidad_ and the _Walrus_ to permit of their removal,
and who were made as comfortable as possible on the gundeck.

I noted uneasily that the groups who passed us were talking eagerly
amongst themselves, with no appearance of the surliness to be
expected normally from any sailors put to extra work, although they
fell silent as soon as they saw who we were.

"They have never been drinking," I muttered to Peter.

"_Neen_," he answered.  "But they get drunk on der treasure."

"Do but see how it is a fell curse upon all who touch it," said
Moira.  "Ah, blessed Virgin, that it were all in the depths of the
ground where God first planted it!"

Our misgivings were justified when we toiled up the sandy slopes of
the hill upon which the stockade was built.  The glare of an immense
bonfire showed through the trees, and rude voices were chanting that
sinister sea-song which had been my introduction to the pirate
brotherhood:

  "Fifteen men on the Dead Man's Chest--
    Yo-ho-ho, and a bottle of rum!
  Drink and the devil had done for the rest--
    Yo-ho-ho, and a bottle of rum!"


I had never heard it sung by the _James'_ crew before.

As we approached the palisades we descried through the openings a
score or two of them, comical in their broad pantaloons, their belts
bristling with cutlasses and pistols, prancing around the fire like
Mohicans dancing a scalp.

They paid no attention to us, and we crossed the cleared area inside
to the door of the blockhouse, where Coupeau lounged against the log
wall.

"_M'sieu le capitaine_ ees com'?" he inquired.

I told him yes.

"Ees com' queeck?" he insisted.

I shrugged my shoulders to this, and he grunted.

"Maybe so we mak'---- com' at those rrrrascal," he suggested.

"Have they had any rum?" I asked suspiciously.

"Non.  They have zee fire--and they see much trrreasure."

He paused.

"Maybe so you com'," he said, and without waiting for us to answer,
strode alone toward the fire.

I shoved Moira inside the blockhouse, and Peter and I started after
him.  I made to draw a pistol, but Peter caught my arm.

"_Neen_," he said.  "We do this wit' our fists andt our voice,
Bob--or we don't do it at all."

Such were Coupeau's tactics--but he relied mostly upon his fists.  He
waded into the dancers, smiting right and left, and Peter and I came
behind him.  Several men reached for their cutlasses, but these we
got to before they had time to draw steel.  In the middle of the row
Murray's voice flashed out from the shadows like a sword, and our
opponents cowered away.

"'Sdeath," he drawled.  "Will you fellows think to take advantage of
me because I turn my back upon you for an hour or two?"

He came forward into the circle of light.

"I warned you no longer ago than last night," he went on icily.  "It
should have been sufficient.  Coupeau!"

"_Oui, m'sieu_."

"Who began the trouble this time?"

The gunner fastened his awful visage upon the whitening faces of the
group of trouble-makers.

"That man."

He pointed.

"Heem.  Heem.  Heem.  Heem."

"Very good," said my great-uncle.  "Most of us prefer to sleep,
seeing that we confront the certainty of a busy morrow; but I have no
wish to disappoint those who would amuse themselves tonight.  Nay, I
will provide entertainment for them.  Take those five, Coupeau, and
the fellows who broiled with them, and stand by whilst their
followers lay on an hundred and fifty lashes with the cat for each."

There was an instant's silence, then a gasp of terror, and one man
commenced to sob.

"Oh, Gawd, cap'n, sir, we'm can't stand no hun'erd'n' fufty lashes!
No mortal man could.  Doan't 'ee say it, sir!  We'm'll crawl to 'ee,
cap'n, sir, 'deed we will."

"You should have thought of that beforehand," replied Murray, unmoved.

"Not a hun'erd an' fifty, cap'n," pleaded a second man.  "'Twill kill
us, sure."

"I should not be surprized if it would," agreed my great-uncle,
taking snuff.  "In fact, were I in your shoes I should hope that it
would.  Take them away, Coupeau--out of earshot, if you please."




CHAPTER XIX

THE ATTACK ON THE STOCKADE

Daylight revealed the _Walrus_ heading in toward the mouth of the
Anchorage; but the smoke from our cooking-fires obviously puzzled
her, and she heaved to and lowered a boat which pulled up the channel
to investigate.  'Twas impossible from our hill-top to see what the
boat's crew did; apparently they turned back so soon as they had
convinced themselves the _James_ was not lurking in ambush.  And the
_Walrus_ took the boat in tow and bore off to the northward under
full sail.

"She is bound for the North Inlet," commented Murray, pocketing his
glass.  "Flint will find the _James_ and be with us again by
mid-afternoon."

"When his battery will make short work of this gimcrack fortress," I
said disagreeably.

"You are unduly pessimistic, Robert," he reproved me.  "'Tis
impossible for a vessel of the _Walrus'_ draft to lie so that she can
bring a full broadside to bear."

"Why not make terms with them?" I argued.  "You have the eight
hundred thousand pounds safe."

"I stated my opposing reasons last night to Mistress O'Donnell."

"But you had not then been compelled to flog five knaves to death," I
objected.  "This is no crew to fight a forlorn hope."

"They and their like have fought for me these thirty years," he
replied placidly.  "Nor do I consider the approaching struggle a
forlorn hope.  Let me involve Flint in an attack upon us here, and I
promise you he'll not bring off enough men to work his ship.  Also,
you err in your first assertion, Robert.  Only three of last night's
mutineers have died.  The other two are yet alive--albeit
uncomfortable, I fancy; exceeding uncomfortable."

"And how they must love you!" I sneered.

"Fear me, you should say," he corrected.  "As I have told you, I have
developed my opportunities in life rather by stimulating men's fears
than by angling for their affections.  Affection, Robert--and the
argument is applicable alike to that tender sentiment which arises
periodically betwixt the sexes--is a most unchancy emotion.  Fear, on
the contrary, once aroused, is never forgotten."

"_Ja_," said Peters, "andt from fear grows hate."

My great-uncle smiled.

"I find myself, as always, moved to admiration of the philosophy you
have distilled from your wide range of experience, friend Peter," he
answered.  "But suffer me to remind you that, in the language of the
alchemists, fear and hate are mutually reactive principles, the one
consuming and neutralizing the other."

Peter chewed a grass-stem without replying, and after a courteous
pause to allow him ample opportunity, Murray inquired:

"Shall we ascertain if Mistress O'Donnell hath completed her toilet?
I own to a normal morning hunger."

"Your mention of her is the mightiest argument for a settlement with
Flint," I protested.  "What hope is there for her, if you----"

"Robert," he interrupted gently, "you speak to no purpose.  The
maid's entire future is entangled with my success--and of my success
there can be no reasonable doubt.  What?  Shall I bow the knee to
that misbegotten crew of gallowscheats aboard the _Walrus_?  You have
seen them!"

His voice rose.

"You know how much of discipline there is amongst them.  Do you think
that men of their stamp can overcome me?  'Tis incredible, I say!  I
can not fail."

"_Ja_," said Peter, spitting out his grass-stem.  "Once you failed."

"Failure is a word of relative significance," retorted my
great-uncle.  "By that which you term failure, Peter, I was impelled
to adopt the career which hath nourished me to this pitch, that I am
the center of a conspiracy which shall overturn kingdoms.  Failure!
You will be telling me next that I am lacking in godliness!"

"_Ja_," said Peter, unperturbed.

"I concede the point!" exclaimed my great-uncle, chuckling.  "And
seeing that we are at last in agreement upon one point, let us sink
our other differences in a pot of chocolate."

There was no more to be said, and however unwillingly, Peter and I
were constrained to do all that we could to aid in strengthening the
position.  'Twas Peter's idea that the men be set to digging shallow
pits behind the stockade to provide additional shelter against
musketry fire from the border of woods and undergrowth at the base of
the hill.  'Twas likewise Peter who suggested, vastly to her
indignation, that we construct for Moira a shot-proof cubby-hole of
treasure chests and kegs in one corner of the blockhouse.

We had scarce finished these preparations when the _Walrus_
reappeared and tacked up the Anchorage to the elbow where it bends
sharply around the larger island which covers the entrance.  Farther
she was unable to go because of shoal water, and for the same reason
she was obliged to anchor practically bow on to us, which meant that,
as Murray had predicted, she could train on the hilltop only her
chase-guns and two or three of the carronades mounted for'ard on her
gundeck.  But she showed no immediate disposition to use her battery.
Her people seemed to be concerned entirely with the task of
disembarkation, and in the space of a glass we reckoned that all of a
hundred and fifty men were landed and straggled irregularly into the
forest.

Then there was a lull in Flint's activities, and we made our final
dispositions for the anticipated attack.  Murray stationed his men
all around the circuit of the stockade, except for those included in
what I have termed the after-guard.  These fellows, about twenty in
number, were held in the blockhouse as a reserve to be thrown to the
support of any part of our line which might require assistance.
Murray himself with Coupeau, Peter and me stood in the center of the
enclosure where he could keep watch upon all that went on.

The afternoon was warm and drowsy.  The _Walrus_ looked like a toy
ship on the oily-smooth surface of the inlet.  There was not a sign
of life aboard her, and the forest that spread betwixt us and the
shore hugged silently whatever secrets it covered.

My great-uncle frowned thoughtfully.

"This is not like Flint," he remarked.  "He must always fly
bull-headed to the attack."

The words were hardly out of his mouth when a shout came from the
side of the stockade fronting the inlet.

"Here be Flint's Redhead!"

And conflicting cries:

"Shoot mun!"

"'Tis flag o' truce!"

"Ta lucky lad!"

We ran forward to the stockade, bidding the men withhold their fire,
and Peter boosted me up on the cross-bar that bound the logs
together.  From this height I could survey the denuded slopes of the
hill and the jungle growth of scrub trees and bush that cinctured it.
And forth from the forest wall projected the unmistakable flaming
locks of Darby McGraw, with one arm which flourished diligently what
once had been a white shirt.  At the first glimpse of me he scrambled
into the open.

"Will ye be letting me come in, Master Bob?" he called.

"Why, that depends," I answered him.  "Are you for spying upon us?"

"Sure, the thought was never in me mind.  I ha' a message for
himself."

"Who?"

"Himself--him that's uncle to ye."

"Well, seeing that we hear each other excellently as we are, suppose
you speak your message from the spot you stand on," I said.

"Troth, that will suit me fine," he replied with alacrity.  "And 'tis
easy said.  Flint will ha' Cap'n Murray shift the treasure to the
foot of the hill, and that done, the _Walrus_ will take it and go.
If he won't, we'll be takin' it anyways--or if by chance we don't,
we'll blow the _James_ out o' the water and leave ye all marooned."

He waxed confidential.

"Aye, and he means that same, Master Bob.  Ye may take me word for
it.  We're a wild, angry crew for the surprize ye give us in the
dark."

"'Twas a fit reward for your treachery, Darby," I returned with some
heat.

He hung his head, digging with his toe in the sand.

"Ah, but that's what pirates will be doing," he said.  "And what way
will there be kindness betwixt men if they do be fighting?  Or
wanting, the one, what the other has?"

"Maybe we haven't the treasure here at all," I suggested.

"We know dif'rent.  The wounded men in the _James_ were afther
tellin' us."

I looked down inquiringly at my great-uncle.

"If they seek terms, they are uncertain of success," he said.  "Send
the boy away."

"But if they destroy the _James_?"

"First they will attack--and after that we will deal with the problem
of protecting the ship."

And as I hesitated----

"Be so good as to answer him at once, Robert, or I shall have him
shot as he stands."

"Go back, Darby," I called.  "Captain Murray will have none of your
offer."

"God save us!" he exclaimed involuntarily.  "I'm thinkin' that will
be the death of many a tall feller, Master Bob.  Well, good luck to
ye and to Master Peter and the elegant young maid.  If we all come
out safe----"

My great-uncle leaped upon a tree-stump and fired a pistol over
Darby's head.  The boy stood motionless a moment, mouth agape.

"The old devil!" he howled then, and fled down the hillside for all
he was worth.

Flint did not wait to receive Murray's verbal answer; that
pistol-shot was sufficiently explicit.  Three musket-shots echoed it
from the foot of the hill, and at once there was a renewed bustle of
men on the fo'csle of the _Walrus_.  A puff of white smoke blew up
from the deck, and the crack of a long twelve started myriads of
seabirds from the seaward marshes.  The shot sang over us and crashed
into the forest beyond.  The other chase-gun bowled a shot into the
enclosure, where it simply buried itself in the soft sand.  Two
carronades, with lower mounts and shorter range, discharged missiles
that fell short of the stockade.  And that first salvo might pass for
a chronology of the bombardment to which we were subjected until
sunset.

One man was killed, and no material damage was done.  The carronades
were unable to reach the blockhouse with their heavier shot, and the
Long Toms lacked the power to penetrate the green wood of the walls.
Most of the round-shot plumped into the sand.  Three posts of the
stockade were knocked over and promptly set up again.  That was all.
The noise was most impressive, with the echoes reverberating across
the island from the sounding-board of the Spyglass, but the net
result was to imbue me with a confidence I had not previously
entertained.  When darkness intervened and the firing ceased we felt
that we had been the winners of the first bout of the struggle.

In the mean time we had not seen a trace of the landing-party from
the _Walrus_, and as the night shut down we all peered curiously
through the posts of the stockade, expecting momentarily to discover
a rush of crouching figures.  But hour after hour passed without a
sound to disturb the silence, and even Murray, whose nerves were of
forged steel, became uneasy as he up-ended the hour-glass for the
third time since sunset and decided to inspect the circuit of the
defenses.

"There is another hand than Flint's behind these Fabian tactics," he
observed.  "Perhaps John Silver's.  'Tis a clever rogue, and a
cunning.  We can not be too vigilant."

Moira, poor lass, was asleep beneath the stack of gold and silver
inside the blockhouse.  Ben Gunn and black Scipio, equally
frightened, were huddled on the doorstep; and the men of the
after-guard were sprawled in the sand, some of them asleep, some of
them gambling--the pirates of both crews were inveterate gamblers--at
pitch-penny or with pebbles and shells or at a kind of mumbletypeg
with their clasp-knives.

Coupeau joined us on the southern arc of the stockade.  He reported
dim flittings and shadowy movements on the lower hillside, but naught
in the nature of an advance or a threat of one.  Elsewhere the men
rose from their burrows and sullenly or stupidly, according to their
dispositions, affirmed they had seen no enemies.  On the north side
we came to a pit which was empty, and in the one next to it a man lay
on his stomach as if asleep.

Murray prodded him with his sword, and the fellow groaned, but did
not stir.

"What is the matter with this man?" demanded my great-uncle.

"Please, zur, 'tis Job Pytchens," answered the man next beyond.

"I asked what was the matter with him," said my great-uncle coldly.

"He'm wur one o' they as had a hun'erd 'n' fufty lashes, cap'n, zur."

I shuddered.  My great-uncle took snuff.

"And who is gone from this vacant place?" he pressed.

"Tom Morphew, zur.  He'm dead, zur."

"Was he shot?"

"No, zur, cap'n.  He'm had a hun'erd 'n' fufty lashes, too."

"Where is he?"

There was a barely appreciable pause.

"Please, zur, us buried him," the man answered.

"Where?"

The man waved an arm vaguely over the sandy top of the hill.

"Ah!  Well, you will leave unburied the next man who dies, be he Job
or another--else I shall have the cat administered to all of you who
have abandoned your posts without permission."

"'Iss, zur.  Thank 'ee, zur," replied the man--but there was no
thanks in his snarling voice; his face was masked by the darkness.

"Stap me," said Murray, turning away, "but these rascals are becoming
as slack as Flint's tattertails!"

Across the clearing a musket exploded.  Then another and another.  A
volley crackled from the lower slopes, and our men replied.  A hoarse
yelling underscored the firing.

"At last!"

Murray's voice vibrated with exultation.

"Now we shall scoop the rogues like so many grains of sand.  The
fools!  A night attack is fatal with undisciplined men."

We ran past the blockhouse, where the after-guard were scrambling to
their feet and Moira was wringing her hands in the doorway.

"Ye won't be leaving me!" she cried to us.

"You must remain under cover, my dear," said my uncle kindly.
"'Twould distress all of us had we to be concerned for your safety."

"'Tis not lead or steel I will be fearful of," says she, "but the
cruel memories that do be creeping from the treasure boxes.  My
troth, I'd liefer be here in the open than within."

My great-uncle hesitated, plainly exasperated by her persistence in
remaining outside.

"Where is Gunn?" he asked.

"Oh, him!"

Moira's laughter trilled as lightly as if there were no messengers of
death in the air.

"He's where ye would have put me first--under the treasure.  And he's
welcome to it."

"Be that as it may," he snapped, giving rein to his exasperation,
"here you shall not stay, my lass, and we are pressed----"

A great roar of firing burst out upon the northern front of the
stockade, and mingled with the reports of the muskets were shouts of:

"Down arms, _Jameses_!"

"Step aside, _James_ lads!"

"All we want is old Murray!"

And a wailing voice cried over and over again--

"Here be Tom Morphew 'n' his bloody back, mates!"

The firing sputtered and dwindled and was succeeded by a prodigious
scuffling and clatter of cutlasses.

"We'll do 'ee no harm, _Jameses_!"

And now I recognized Silver's voice.

"Strike arms, _Jameses_!"

Three men, one of them with a broken arm, raced up to us.

"Long John's in," sobbed one.

"Tom Morphew let 'em in," panted a second.

"Excellently planned," drawled Murray.

I heard the click of his snuffbox.

"Yet observe how fate hath tricked our opponents," he went on.  "They
timed their second attack to catch me on the southern side of the
stockade, whereas, thanks to the perversity of womankind, I am
strategically disposed to exploit the disorder which attends their
success.  I think we shall teach the clever Master Silver a lesson."

"Yes, if your men are loyal," I said angrily.

"Any crew are loyal in victory, Robert," he answered.

"_Ja_," spoke Peter, "but you better not let dot feller talk about
his bloody back."

"You are squeamish, it seems, Peter," murmured my great-uncle.
"Well, I shall even seek to humor you.  Coupeau!"

His voice hardened.

"_Oui, m'sieu_."

The gunner stepped from the huddled ranks of the after-guard.

"We attack."

But indeed the attack was made upon us.  We had not advanced four
paces from the shelter of the blockhouse when fifty or sixty of the
invaders stormed out of the night, howling and waving their
cutlasses.  We fired one smashing volley that dropped a fourth of
them, and charged.  A few pistol-shots met us, but most of the
_Walrus'_ men had discarded their muskets, preferring to fight
sailor-fashion with the cutlass, and they were utterly disheartened
by the unexpectedness of the reception we gave them.

Murray's slender dress-sword was a bodkin of death which pricked a
path through the densest ranks.  On one side of him Peter swung a
clubbed musket which shattered heads and limbs at every step.  On his
other side Coupeau wielded a cutlass with equal effect.

A yellow crescent moon was riding over the treetops, and we halted in
the gap the attackers had torn in the stockade to survey our
situation by its light.  Half-way down the hill a group of the
_Walrus'_ men rallied and commenced to fire up at us; and Coupeau was
for pushing after them, but my great-uncle checked him.

"No, no, Coupeau!  Yonder is John Silver, astraddle of the stockade.
See, he is helping up another fellow.  They have been cut off by our
charge, and if you please, we'll deal with them first."

I will admit a pang of sympathy for Silver.  He was not more than
twenty yards from us, and by dint of well-nigh incredible efforts,
with the other man to boost him, he had succeeded in scaling the
stockade and was sitting there, with his one leg dangling inside.
When we discovered him he started to swing his leg over the top,
evidently intending to abandon his companion.  But whether because of
something the other man said or because he feared he must injure
himself in dropping the eight feet to the ground without any one to
check his fall, he abruptly changed his mind and faced about toward
us very resolutely, seizing hold of the crutch which hung from his
neck by its thong.

The man at the foot of the stockade gathered himself together like a
coiling serpent and plucked a long knife from his belt.  He had been
in the shadow until then, but now the moonlight shone over his torso
and we recognized him for the blind man, Pew.  He had lost his green
eyeshade, and his pockmarked face was cadaverous in the yellow glow.
His eyes were open, and they seemed to smolder dully as they strained
at us.  His knife glinted in his hand.

"Will you be assisted down and be hanged whole, or must we cut you
down, Silver?" hailed Murray.

He, like the rest of us, ignored the blind man.  Our attention was
fixed upon Silver, his broad face very calm in the moonlight.

"Them there ain't exackly tempting terms, Cap'n Murray, sir," Silver
answered temperately.  "Couldn't ye be a mite more generous?"

"I am serving you a dish no more highly sauced than that you intended
for me," returned my great-uncle dryly.

"Now, sir; now, sir," remonstrated Silver.  "How can ye say that?
All we done was to try and persuade ye to give us our share o' the
treasure--you havin' eight hundred thousand pound stowed away
special, accordin' to your own story.  And if we come in by the back
door a'ter it, why that was so's we'd hurt ye least."

"You'd argue yourself to a block of ice in Hell, Silver," rejoined my
great-uncle amusedly.  "Throw down that crutch!  Drop that knife,
you, sirrah, Pew--or whatever your name is!"

Sword in hand, he advanced ahead of the rest of us, who were strung
out all the way from the gap in the stockade.  Coupeau was at his
elbow, and Peter and I close behind.

"Come," he adjured them a second time.  "I'm in no mood to talk
terms, and if you delay 'twill make your end the more painful."

Silver's face went livid in the moonlight.

"Aye," rasped the one-legged man, "ye'll lash us bloody-raw like the
lads as let us in tonight."

And as Murray continued to advance, he struck out with his crutch.

"Keep off," he shrieked.  "Keep off!"  And then: "I can't reach him,
Ezra.  Let him have it!"

Pew crouched with his knife-hand drawn back.

"Aye, it takes blind Pew to let him have it," he croaked in his
hateful voice.

His hand jerked forward.  There was a flash in the moonlight, and my
great-uncle staggered, the flung knife buried to the hilt in his side.

"I am stabbed," he gasped.

Silver brandished his crutch over his head.

"Pew's stabbed Murray!" he shouted.  "Come on, _Walruses_!  Lay off,
ye _James_ lads--we'll not harm ye, mates.  Treasure for all, and no
more tyranny!"

Peter and I caught my great-uncle as he fell.  Coupeau jumped at the
blind man with a bellow of rage, cutlass raised to strike; but as he
came within reach Silver poised his crutch like a spear, leaned over
and drove the sharp spike of the ferrule through the gunner's eye
into the brain.  Coupeau dropped in his tracks.

"I ha' done for Coupeau," Silver shouted again.  "Don't make Long
John do it all, lads!"

There was such a rush of enemies, such a howl of exultation, as took
my breath away.

"Do you hold Murray, Peter," I said.  "I'll finish that precious
pair."

And I ran in at Pew, albeit more warily than Coupeau; but the blind
man--and certes, if he was blind his hearing was so marvelous as to
make up for it--retained a clubbed pistol, which was a serviceable
weapon at close quarters, and Silver covered him overhead with that
deadly crutch.  I shouted to the after-guard to shoot them, but our
people had not reloaded their pieces, and many were already engaged
with the party we had just driven out, who swarmed in again through
the same gap.  Those of the _James'_ men who were nearest were
palpably lukewarm, and Silver, atop of the stockade, perceiving his
advantage, thrust his crutch at me and continued trumpeting his
rallying-cries.

"Murray's a goner, mates!  Coupeau's shark-bait!  There's only the
two Buckskins left.  Go easy wi' they _Jameses_.  Naught for ye to
fight about, _James_ lads!  We'll divide square with ye."

Men swirled toward us from all sides of the stockade, the _James'_
crew mingled with the _Walrus_, and where our people fought at all
'twas faint-heartedly and to no purpose.  We were pressed back, and
presently were put to it to avoid being surrounded.

"We go to der house, Bob," squeaked Peter.  "Der _James_ men don't
fight for us no more."

He had Murray's limp body slung over one shoulder and still retained
the iron barrel of his musket--the stock had been demolished; but he
ran easily beside me through the sand.

There was tremendous confusion within the stockade enclosure, and but
for this and a considerate cloud which draped the new-risen moon we
should never have gained the blockhouse.  Our men disappeared at
every yard.  Two were slain in the beginning of the retreat, and the
continuous cries of "stand off, _Jameses_--us won't hurt 'ee," sapped
the remainder of such loyalty as had survived the vicissitudes of the
last few days.

We reached the blockhouse alone on the side opposite the door, and
circled it cautiously, no little concerned for Moira's safety, for
pistols were popping and cutlasses clashing in several directions
close at hand.  With the moon obscured we could not see a musket's
length ahead, and as I turned in toward the black oblong of the
doorway I tripped over a corpse.

"'Tis on your own head your death will be, my man," said a cool
voice.  "I can hear you fine, and if you're not after----"

"Moira!" I exclaimed.

"And is it you, Bob?  Oh, blessed saints, but I'm that glad.  I
thought you were--  Is that Peter?"

"_Ja_," said Peter.

"And what will ye have on your shoulder?  A dead man?  Is it him I
shot a few minutes back?"

"'Tis Captain Murray," I answered, making way for Peter.

"Oh, Queen of Heaven!  Sure, we're in bad case."

"We are," I assented grimly as I followed Peter inside.  "Have you a
light?"

She took a lanthorn from under a cloth, and its scanty rays played
hide-and-seek with the shadows over the rude log walls and the piles
of rum barrels and kegs of hard-tack and the clumsy stack of treasure.

"Where are Ben Gunn and Scipio?" I asked.

"They made off after I shot him that lies outside.  They were
mightily feared of what Captain Flint would be doing to them did he
find them here, and one of his men dead at the door."

Peter laid my great-uncle gently upon the earthen floor--there was no
softer bed--and began cutting away the garments from around the hilt
of the knife, which was still fixed in his right side.

"And why didn't you go with them?" I asked.  She gave me an indignant
look.

"And be leaving the two of ye!  I am not that kind of friend, Bob."

Peter looked up from his task.

"You got to watch dot door, Bob.  Andt, Moira, you bring me some rum.
Maybe Murray gets back his sense before----"

I suddenly found myself unwilling to believe it could be so.

"He can't, Peter!"

"_Ja_," replied the Dutchman patiently.  "Pretty soon he goes.  He
bleeds inside."

I stumbled to the doorway with my head in a whirl.  Murray dying?
'Twas incredible!  That tremendous personality, so masterful, so
aloof, dominating all with whom he came in contact, saltily
compounded of wickedness, greatness, wisdom and naive vanity!  And
explain it how you will, I suddenly discovered an admiration for him
which had been growing for months beneath my surface resentment.  Up
to this moment I had detested him.  But I choked now at the thought
of his death.  Whatever he was, he was no coward.  And there was
about his end in this sordid, haphazard fashion, stabbed by a blind
man in the dark, a redeeming touch of high tragedy.  He, whose
ambitions had vaulted the stars, to perish by the hand of Pew!  And
in a moment when apparently he had snatched victory from defeat!

Mechanically I carried chests of gold and silver ingots from the heap
of treasure and built a barricade across the doorway.  There were
several spare muskets and pistols, and I loaded these and placed them
handy, then knelt behind the barricade and waited for what was to
come.  But nothing came.  Feet shush-shushed in the sand all around
the blockhouse; voices called, questioned and argued; an occasional
shot was fired--no more.  Flint's triumph had been too amazingly
complete for him to grasp, and evidently there were dissensions in
the pirates' ranks as to what the next step should be.

The hour-glass we had fetched from the _Royal James_ stood by the
door, and I remember that I turned it twice before Peter tapped my
shoulder.

"He wants you," he said.

Murray lay with his head in Moira's lap.  On his face was stamped a
waxy pallor.  His nostrils were sunken and pinched in.  A crimson
froth showed at the corner of his mouth.  But his tawny eyes blazed
with the unconquerable fire of his spirit.  As I stooped over him a
mocking gleam radiated from their black depths, and his lips moved in
almost voiceless speech.

"Sorry, eh?"  I nodded, and the mockery became more pronounced.

"Would have--won you--boy--in--time."  Moira wiped the dreadful
bubbles from his lips.

"You--won't--carry--out--plot?" he asked.

"'Twould be dishonest to promise," I answered.  "And I doubt if we
are like to live much longer than you."  The fingers of one hand
fluttered strangely.

"Tut, boy--never--lose hope.  Win--yet--myself."

His colorless lips parted in a ghastly smile at the shocked disbelief
in my face.

"This--will be--end--of Flint.  Kill me--kill himself."  His fingers
fluttered again, and Moira whispered----

"'Twill be his snuffbox he's after wanting, Bob."

And as I fumbled for it in the wreck of his coat she added----

"But 'twill be his death does he use it the once."

I hesitated, but the look in his eyes impelled me to give it to him.

"Good lad!"

And his fingers closed lovingly on the jeweled trinket, picking at
the lid he was wont to click open and shut in moments of perplexity.
The tawny eyes flirted toward Moira.

"Take care--maid--good blood--in--her.  Family,
Robert--breeding--landmarks in--mad world."

"I'll do what I can," I promised, seeing he expected an answer.

"Might do--worse--or more," he replied with the shadow of a smile.
"Pew's knife--kept you--being--duke--Moira----"

A pause whilst Moira wiped his mouth.

"A mad world," he repeated.  "What will--Prince Charles--say?"

His eyes clouded, and he murmured a snatch of song, one of those
ranting Jacobite ballads that spread like wildfire after the '45--

  "Cope sent a challenge frae Dunbar,
  'Charlie, meet me an ye daur'----"


A coughing fit interrupted him, weakened him so I thought he was
sped; but the ghostly voice went on with a hint of the gay, reckless
tune:

  "Hey, Johnnie Cope, are ye waukin' yet?
  Or are your drums a-beatin' yet?
  If ye waur waukin' I wad----"


His voice strengthened.

"Ah, your Royal Highness!  The procession is ordered--the
heralds--waiting--my Lords--Commons----"

He struggled so to rise that to save him I propped him against my
shoulder.

"A glad day--this--and long coming.  Do you use snuff--sir?  'Tis
Rip-Rap--a sound brand."

He open the box and raised a pinch to his nostrils.

"A glad day--sir--but a mad world."

And so he died.




CHAPTER XX

PRISONERS

"Ahoy, the blockhouse!"

Moira stayed her weeping, and I rose from my knees as the hail
thundered from the night.

"Dot's Flint," whispered Peter.  "You talk to him, Bob, _ja_."

"What is it?" I shouted back.

"Is Murray with ye?"

"He's dead," I answered after a moment of reflection.

"And that's ---- ---- lucky for him!  Here's Tom Morphew ready to
give him a taste of the cat."

A shrill howl echoed the words.

"Don't 'ee believe mun, Cap'n Flint!  'Tis all a lie!  And 'ee
promised I should ha' t' beatin' o' mun."

"'Tis true," I said wearily.  "After sunrise you can send in a man to
see for himself."

"Ah!" jeered Flint.  "But ye see I'm not waiting for sunup or moonset
or aught else, my Buckskin.  We know how many o' ye there are; and if
ye don't surrender, why, we'll put a torch to the blockhouse and
roast ye out.  Fire won't hurt gold and silver, but 'tain't friendly
to live meat."

"'Twill cost you something first," I retorted.

"Not so much as ye might think."

"Dot's right," squeaked Peter beside me.  "_Ja_, you better make a
bargain wit' him, Bob."

"A bargain," I repeated.  "What on earth can we bargain with?"

"Der treasure on der Dead Man's Chest."

"But that is----"

I turned to Moira.

"In a manner of speaking, that treasure is yours.  'Twas in your
father's name, to be held in trust for others.  Are you willing----"

"My faith, any cause will be the better without it," she interrupted.
"What has it done but bring bloodshed and suffering upon all who
trafficked in it?  If it will just win us our lives, Bob, 'twill be
the one good deed to its credit."

"Time's runnin' short," shouted Flint.  "If ye won't surrender we'll
start the fagots."

"Suit yourself," I replied with as much confidence as I could muster.
"There are three of us here, and 'tis we know where the treasure lies
on the Dead Man's Chest.  If you won't even promise our lives we'll
make the bitterest fight we can and carry the secret with us."

There was a gabble of protest at this, several others joining their
voices to Flint's, among them Silver.

"Naught's been said o' slayin' ye," declared Flint.  "Give up the
treasure, and we'll part friends."

"Aye, aye, Master Ormerod," called Silver.  "Cap'n Flint puts it
straight.  There ain't a man of us would wish to be your enemy."

I looked hopelessly at Peter.

"What more can we win?" I asked.  "'Tis a mockery to place credence
in their promises."

"_Ja_," nodded Peter.  "We don't trust 'em.  But we know dot, Bob.
We don't be fooled.  Andt now anyway we get off alive.
Afterwards----"

He shrugged his mountainous shoulders.

"If we do but get off this terrible island we are that much improved
in our circumstances!" exclaimed Moira.  "Glory, but I'll wear the
skin from me knees when I see another woman's face--not that I'm
ungrateful to the two of ye here, that are as brave cavaliers as any
maid ever owed her all to."

What she said set me to pondering again, and I called to Flint----

"Mistress O'Donnell must have every consideration she is accustomed
to, with decent lodging in the cabin and we two to attend her."

"Gut me!" roared Flint.  "D'ye think we conduct a nunnery aboard the
_Walrus_?"

"I am thinking she is a young maid by her lone, which is hard enough,
let be she must dwell with pirates," I answered.

"There's Rule Four of our Articles," he sneered.  "Ye will ha' heard
it before.  It should be assurance for any maid."

"You have heard my terms," I said.  "Take them or leave them.
There's eight hundred thousand pounds to be gained from treating us
kindly.  If you do not so, as sure as I am here we will die, the
three of us, before we yield you the secret--and you should know the
years 'twill require to dig over the Dead Man's Chest."

"We'll take you," he replied ill-naturedly.  "And such a argufying
swab I never listened to or will again, ---- my eyes.  Are ye fixed
in your mind, Buckskin?"

"Yes."

"Drop your arms and bide where ye are, then.  We're comin' in to look
ye over."

Torches flickered around the circuit of the stockade, and as they
drew nearer Peter and I tore down the barricade of treasure I had
built across the doorway.  Figures appeared in the wavy light, naked
to the waist, scratched by the jungle growth; uncouth, grizzled faces
lowered at us.

"Keep back," I warned them.  "We'll let no man in until Captain Flint
is here."

"Careful, ain't ye, Buckskin?" he mocked me from behind a clump of
pirates.  "Make way, shipmates.  Ye'll all ha' a chance to see the
treasure, soon or late, and we'll share in it equal and regular,
accordin' to the Articles."

The group split to make way for him, and he strode up to the door.
Bones was with him, and Silver, and the man they called Black Dog,
who carried a torch, as did Bones.  And behind them all limped an
awful creature, whose grimy face was a mask of pain, whose bare back
and flanks were crisscrossed with festering welts.  In one hand he
held a cat-o'-nine-tails, the pendent rope lashes with their jagged
knots stained a dark claret hue.

Bones flourished his torch as they entered the low door, and the
light shone into every corner of the big hut.

"Is that Murray?"

He pointed to the body that lay beneath the hacked remnants of the
plum satin coat which served as shroud.

"Yes," I said, and Moira shrank betwixt Peter and me as they crowded
forward, staring open-mouthed at the cold clay that represented the
man they had so feared and hated.

"Gut me," swore Flint.  "I never thought to see Andrew Murray lyin'
stark."

Silver's eyes glinted from his slab of a face.

"He don't figure much now, do he, mates?" he said.

"Let's have a look at him," spoke up Bones abruptly.  "Here, Black
Dog, bring up your light, too."

The man with the sore back limped after them, drawing the tails of
his cat through the fingers of one hand with a kind of lingering
caress.

"Let me at mun," he muttered.  "I'll flay mun, I will!  I'll learn
mun t' murder sailormen.  Five o' us, and----"

Bones brushed off the plum satin coat with one toe, and Murray's
gaunt white face smiled up at them, faintly satirical, the snuff-box
still clutched in one hand.

"---- me, 'tis so he looked ever!" gasped Flint.

"'Tain't right nor natural," said Bones.  "He looks like he knowed we
was here--and couldn't harm him none."

Silver said nothing, peering down at the dead man with a puzzled
frown as if he were trying to read something that was hidden behind
the impassive features.

"He'll look dif'rent when I lash mun," whined the man with the cat,
pushing past Black Dog.  "Wait till t' cat slices into t' back o'
mum, cap'n.  I'll cut t' grin off'n t' devil's face o' mun."

'Twas Silver caught the poor fellow's arm as it was raised to strike.

"No, no, Tom!" he cried.  "Murray's dead."

"Dead?" answered the man dazedly.  "But 'ee promised I should ha' t'
beatin' o' mun!"

"Aye, Tom; but ye can't beat a dead man."

"Why?  He beat me till I was like t' die.  He beat three o' my mates
till they died, an' Job Pytchens is a-dyin' out in the sand right
now."

But Flint himself snatched the cat from the man's grasp with
unaffected horror.

"Ye can't beat a dead man, Tom," insisted the _Walrus'_ captain.
"'Tis bad luck.  And look at the good luck we ha' had since we found
Darby McGraw!  I can tell ye, mates, I'm a-going to hang on to my
luck."

Bones growled assent, and Silver added----

"Aye, aye, cap'n; and if ye'll be guided by me ye'll lose no time in
puttin' Murray underground."

They all exchanged superstitious glances, and Bones said hoarsely----

"He were close to bein' more'n human, weren't he?"

"They do say as how ye can chain down a ha'nt by drivin' a stake
through the body," suggested Black Dog--and he shook so that his
torch scattered sparks.

"Ye couldn't pin Murray down that way if he was of a mind to ha'nt
ye," answered Silver.  "Not that I believe in ha'nts myself."

"It's bad luck to mutilate the dead," objected Flint.  "No, no, we'll
bury him quick and be done with it."

"But 'ee promised I was t' beat mun," sobbed Tom Morphew.  "I let 'ee
in, Long John, and 'ee promised!"

"How was I to know he'd be dead?" returned Silver.  "Don't ye take on
so, Tom.  We'll give ye a double handful o' onzas for what ye done,
and when your back's well ye'll ha' a rare spree wi' the yellow boys,
eh?"

But Morphew refused to be comforted.  He limped from the hut,
trailing his whip behind him.

"'Tisn't goold I want," he wept.  "'Tis to lay my lash to t' back o'
mun.  Aye!  Till he do be bloody raw, same as Job Pytchens and they
other lads as is under sod.  Oh, my pore back!"

There was an interval of silence after he was gone.

"It's bad luck to touch the dead," reaffirmed Flint.  "No, no, the
thing to do is to bury him quick.  You take half a dozen men, Bill,
and plant him anywhere--so's he's deep enough."

"And what about the treasure?" called one of the men by the door.

"Aye, aye," chimed in a second.  "When do we shift it aboard and
divvy up?"

Flint stroked his chin, considering.

"Why, there's no hurry about the treasure, mates," he answered
finally.  "'Tis safe here.  What we all need now is a dram o' rum and
two watches below."

There was a general murmur of assent with this sentiment, and he
crooked his finger at me.

"Come along, Buckskin.  We'll put the three o' ye aboard-ship, out o'
harm's way, seein' as ye're so precious o' your skins.  Long John,
I'll leave it to ye to guard the prisoners.  Give the girl a
stateroom for herself--less'n ye might wish to share it, Buckskin?"
he added with a leer that fetched a ruddy tide to Moira's cheeks.

He guffawed.

"Dainty, ain't ye, my lass?  Well, the _Walrus_ is a pirate, not a
private man-o-war, and maybe ye'll learn a thing or two."

Silver motioned us to precede him into the night, and as we passed
out he gathered together a party of men who formed loosely around us.

"If so be as ye'll give me your word to come peaceable, Master
Ormerod, I can make things easier for ye," he offered when we were
clear of the hut.

"What do you say, Peter?" I asked the Dutchman.

"_Ja_."

"That's enough for me," announced Silver cheerfully.  "And very
sensible of ye, too, gentlemen.  Not quite so fast.  I'm only a
crippled sailorman, and I ha' labored hard this night.  Aye, it were
such a seesaw o' fortune as kep' my heart a-poppin' in my throat.  I
thought ye had me on the stockade; but there's none like Pew wi' the
knife, and he can smell his man when he can't see him.  Well, well,
who'd ha 's'posed when we met in New York we'd come to aught like
this, Master Ormerod?"

I lacked the heart to answer him, and we stumbled through the woods
in silence to the shore of the Anchorage.  Here one of the _Walrus'_
boats was launched, and we were rowed out to where she lay, her hull
squatting like a rock in the quiet water.  Men hailed us from her
deck, a whip was sent down for Silver's convenience, and the rest of
us climbed the side ladder, Moira as agile as any after her months at
sea.

"Here we are, safe and snug on the old _Walrus_," remarked Silver,
still aggressively cheery; "and them as is here can call theirselves
fortunate, 'cause there's a plenty as ha' kept Murray company.  Aye,
blast me for a swab, but it ha' been a bloody night.  Get for'ard,
mates."

This to the men who had come off with us.

"I'll see to the pris'ners.  Now then, gentlemen--and mistress--you
come along wi' me, and I'll make ye all as comf'table as if ye was in
a Bristol packet."

He prodded a muscular forefinger into my chest.

"You mind that, Master Ormerod.  You mind that Long John was your
friend.  'Cause why, says you?  'Cause there's never a man could see
through the sand in the hourglass, could he now?  And we'll ha' queer
times ahead o' us--aye, queer times.  How queer, says you?  Ah, how'm
I to know?  All I says, and I stands on my words, is there'll be
queer times--and you mind Long John was kindly and stood your friend,
hearty and free.  D'ye see?"

He plainly desired an answer, although I was not very certain of what
he was driving at with this rigmarole.

"I'm afraid I don't," I said shortly.

He cocked his head on one side.

"Ye don't?  Humph, there's things best left unsaid, but I'll put this
to ye.  Here's the _Walrus_, and here's a treasure, and here's Flint,
and here's maybe twelvescore lads as don't all think alike, and
here's Bill Bones--and here's me.  A goodish bit might happen, my
master.  And who's to say what will start it a-happenin'?  Not me!
Nor who might come out on top a'terwards."

And with a parting wink he stumped aft, crooking his finger in sign
that we should follow him across the untidy deck.

"Glory!" sniffed Moira, her nose in air.  "This will be more the like
of a stable than a ship."

She did not exaggerate.  The _Walrus_ was dirtier than she had been
the night Peter and I were committed to her as hostages.  Her decks
were foul with grease and all manner of filth; her paint was cracked
and peeling; a cloud of flies buzzed around a tub of fish-guts which
nobody would take the trouble to cast overside; from an open hatch
poured a sour, acrid stench.  A strange contrast with the _Royal
James_!

Inside the companionway under the poop we tripped over the usual
litter of broken bottles, pistol-flints and odds and ends of cast-off
clothing.  Silver balanced himself on his crutch against the wall,
struck flint and steel to a slow-match and ignited the wick of a
whale-oil lanthorn which depended from a hook.  Holding this above
his head, he surveyed the double line of stateroom doors, very
similar to the plan of the cabin quarters of the _James_.

"Room for all," he pronounced.  "This here to larboard is Flint's,
and Bones' berth's opposite.  T'others are full o' junk, but ye can
soon clear 'em out."

Inspection revealed that the junk was mostly Jamaica rum and other
strong liquors, which we removed to the main cabin.  But the crusted
dirt of years was not so easily dispossessed.  Silver, to do him
justice, was tolerant of our initial efforts, and went so far as to
procure us a bucket on a rope which we could lower over the side for
water; but he wearied of such fruitless work after a time and hopped
away to his hammock with admonitions to us to be satisfied "there
ain't no nipper-bugs in them bunks."

We did the best we could, which was very little, and then persuaded
Moira to risk lying in the cleaner of the two rooms--we had chosen it
for her because it had a bolt on the inside of the door and offered
her a degree of privacy--while Peter and I berthed across the
companionway, Peter on the floor by reason of his bulk, and I in the
one cramped bunk.  And I marvel to say that we went promptly asleep
and did not waken until the noon sun was flooding through the grimy
panes of the cabin windows.

A rumble of snores assured us that Flint and Bones were in their
berths, but the sound of a familiar brogue drew us aft to the main
cabin.

"And what way will ye ha' cause for complaint that ha' seen men walk
the plank and been to Madygascar and the East Indies and Afriky where
the naygurs come from?  On me soul, ye sicken me with your whining!
Holy ----, man, do but look to me that am a pirate these many months,
and all the fighting they will ha' throwed in me way was with other
pirates--and them great, powerful rogues that give as good as we
sent.  Sure, I haven't been at the scuttling of any wan----"

"But ye had a cutlass to your hand and a musket on your shoulder,"
protested another familiar voice.  "And ye walk the deck wi'out shoes
to your feet, and ye ha' a fine bright kerchief to the head o' ye,
and if ye seek to haul on a rope or hold to the wheel there's no man
will say ye nay, Darby.  But wi' me it's been lackey's work an'
livery-shuits since the first day I went to sea.  It's 'Ben, clear
the table!' or 'Fill up the glasses, Ben Gunn!' or 'Fetch me the
'backy, Gunn!' I'm no more a pirate than the Irish maid----"

"Don't ye be naming her, or I'll lay the end o' a rope to ye!  I
won't ha' ye talkin' the way ye were betther nor ye are.  Didn't the
cap'n give ye to me for me sarvant?  Sure, he did!  '---- me,' says
he when we took ye, 'Darby, you're a good cabin boy and main lucky.
I'll give ye the feller to be doin' your work for ye."

"Well, there was one promised to take me out o' livery-shuits,"
answered Gunn doggedly, "and if he----"

He broke off as we entered from the companionway, writhing with the
excess of embarrassment which visited him when in the presence of
several persons.  Darby McGraw was no less surprized and leaped up
from the chair in which he had been lounging, bobbing his head to
Moira with the vigor of a heathen kowtowing to an idol.  All the boy
wore was a pair of canvas trousers belted about his waist and a
kerchief from which straggled his carroty locks.  A cutlass slapped
his thighs, and three pistols were stuck through his belt.

"Master Bob!" he exclaimed.  "And Master Peter, too!
And--and--Misthress O'Donnell--sure, there's a harp within me does be
strummin' pretty music this instant!"

He grinned; and for all his months aboard the _Walrus_, his grin was
as sunny as in the counting-room in Pearl Street.

"Ye'll be forgivin' me, ma'am, that am Irish meself, and must think
o' the lakes o' Wicklow when I look to your eyes."

Moira clasped her hands.

"Wicklow!" she cried.  "'Twas in Wicklow I was born, and my mother
before me."

"Ah, then, 'tis glad I will be I met ye this side o' the world," he
answered, clapping his hand to his cutlass-hilt very hardily.  "For
if we'd come on each other in Wicklow I'd be no more nor a gossoon of
a bog-trotter and ye one o' the grand gentry-folk."

Moira's laugh had the note of fairy chimes I had not heard since her
father fell on the _James'_ deck.

"'Tis you are the lad with the silver tongue," she said.  "But if ye
come from Wicklow, Darby, it will be almost as if we were of the same
family."

She suddenly sobered.

"And I, that might be elder cousin or maybe sister to you, must be
asking why ye are a pirate?  Were ye not honest-born?"

Darby's embarrassment was almost as painful as Ben Gunn's.

"Why, ye see--  There was in me always the wish for the sea--  I was
no more nor a bound-boy--  And Long John, he says----"

"Darby," she interrupted sternly, "how long will it be since ye
confessed?"

He poked at his bare toes with the tip of his cutlass-sheath.

"Why, maybe--oh, a month this way or maybe that, I'd say--well,
troth, if ye put it to me----"

"A many months," she asserted.

"I'll not deny it," he admitted, shamefaced.

"And you from Wicklow, Darby!"

"'Tis no fault o' mine when I couldn't come at the priest."

"Maybe no, if you held your ways in places a priest would frequent;
but who would be expecting a priest in a pirate-ship?  And what would
the priest say did ye go to him and confess what ye ha' done?  Oh,
Darby, ye will be a monstrous wicked boy!"

Darby was overwhelmed.

"On me soul, I never meant to be!  Troth, there's none will ever be
repenting better nor me--if I do but get the chance.  But do ye see,
misthress, it will be the like o' this: Whiles ye lives wi' pirates
ye must be main wicked, and aftherwards, when ye break free o' them,
there'll be lashin's o' time to make up for it."

He sought to cover his confusion by rounding upon Ben Gunn, who had
stood trembling to one side throughout this dialogue.

"What way will this be that ye act, ye lackey?" he demanded with an
excellent imitation of Flint's manner.  "Will ye be too stupid or
feared to see we are waitin' our bite and sup?"

"Stop!  Stop!" I intervened as poor Gunn started to scramble from the
cabin.  "How comes it you are here?  Do I understand you have been
relegated to your former duties by Captain Flint?"

"I don't know what relegated means, Master Ormerod," replied Gunn
forlornly; "but I'm doin' my former dooties, yessir.  I figgered last
night 'twas all up wi' Cap'n Murray, which same I hears is true, and
so I says to myself, I says, 'Ben, you go and tell Cap'n Flint here's
a man as is glad and willin' to j'in up and serve him handsome, a man
as is as good a sailor, give him a chance, as any afloat.'"

He shuffled his feet a moment, regarding me sidewise.

"Ye see," he amended, "I figgered as how with Cap'n Murray gone
'twouldn't hardly be possible for you to give me the new ratin' we
talked about once.  And then bein' the circumstances it seemed all
ways fair as I should make the best deal----"

"Yes, yes," I said; "but what did Cap'n Flint say?"

Ben Gunn scratched his head in some perplexity.

"He said summat as how I was too good a lackey to spoil.  And then he
called to Darby and told him a good cabin boy desarved his own
sarvant and here I was.  And here I be, sir!  Unlucky I were born,
steppin' into a livery-shuit as page-boy, and unlucky I ha' lived.
And unlucky I'll die, I reckon, sir.  But I won't die in no
livery-shuit, no, sir!"

With which he shuffled off.

"The ignorant natural!" snorted Darby disgustedly.  "Him to be a
pirate!"




CHAPTER XXI

FLINT'S WAY

Bones swaggered into the cabin whilst we were still eating, and his
leathery face crinkled in what he intended for an amorous grimace as
his eyes fell upon Moira.

"This is what I calls proper homelike," he declared.  "You come and
sit on Billy's knee, my pretty, and cut up this here goat for me."

I started to rise, but Darby was ahead of me.

"Do ye so much as put a finger on her, and I'll send a bullet into
the black heart o' ye," he challenged in his shrill boy's voice.

"Oh, ye will?  Ye red-headed----"

"Me head's the ship's luck," boasted Darby.  "The less ye say on that
score, the betther for ye."

"We'll see to that!" snarled Bones.  "You're the cabin boy, my lad,
and no more; and I----"

He tugged at his cutlass-hilt, and Darby, in no wise daunted, hauled
forth a pistol as long as his arm.  But before one could assail the
other Flint shoved in from the companionway and caught Bones by the
shoulder.

"What now, Bill?" he demanded.  "Ain't we got enough to face wi'out
you fightin' in the cabin?"

"And would ye ha' me take impidence and worse from this red-headed
land-rat as Long John picked up in New York?" shouted Bones.

"I'd not," returned Flint.  "Darby, you may be my good luck and a lad
o' promise, but I'll lay the cat to your shoulders if you go for to
make trouble."

"'Twas him was afther makin' the throuble," answered Darby sturdily.
"Wasn't he botherin' Misthress O'Donnell?  Sure, I'm Irish, the same
as her, and I'll kill the rogue that does be givin' her cause for to
weep a tear--that I will.  And I care not who he may be!"

"Easy, all," admonished Flint.  "What's this, Bill?"

"Blow me for a dock-swab if I can see as how she'd oughter be set
apart," blustered Bones.  "I'm mate, I am, and if I----"

Flint's bloodshot eyes focused upon him with something of the silent
force that I had seen Murray employ against his wild crew.

"You know better nor that, Bill," he said quietly.  "Here Long John's
just been to tell me the crew ha' demanded a fo'csle council, and God
knows what Allardyce and his gang will be up to.  And you want to
bust into the middle of Rule Four.  Gut me!  There's many things I
held against Andrew Murray, but one thing he did as was the wisest
any gentleman adventurer ever done--and it's to his credit no less
because Bart Roberts done it before him--and that was Rule Four."

"A woman's a prize, same as treasure," grumbled Bones.

"Oh, no, she ain't!  A woman's trouble--she's no prize.  You know
what happens when there's women aboard a buccaneer.  Jealousy,
fightin', and as much blood spilled as in an action.  We can't afford
to lose no more men, Bill.  Here we are wi' a bare ship's company
left out o' five hundred men!  I tell ye I'm for sendin' down the
plank any man as draws a knife from this day."

"Much good it'll do ye," said Bones.

"We'll see to that.  Anyhow, I'll ha' no fightin' over women."

He scowled himself.

"I'd throw the wench overboard if it weren't that she's my best
chance to find the stuff Murray hid."

"If harm comes to her you'll get no such knowledge from any of us," I
interposed.

"Oh, belay that!" he rasped.  "You're lucky to be alive, and the one
reason for it is that ye know what ye know."

He turned to Bones again.

"Now, mark me, Bill, lay off her.  When we get this treasure cleaned
up ye can take all the time ye fancy for wenches or aught else."

"Aye, when we do!"

"And that'll be sooner than ye think," retorted Flint.

"Wi' the crew all shoutin' for disbandment?  Allardyce talkin' of
goin' home tomorrow?  I ha' seen ye handle some bad times, John
Flint, but you're no Andrew Murray!"

The gibe annoyed Flint.  His face turned blue, as it did when his
temper was fanned or he was in liquor.

"Watch me," he snapped.  "I'll learn 'em a few things yet.  No Andrew
Murray!  Maybe not.  But I ha' my own way, Bill.  Aye, Flint's way!
And it ain't so bad."

He suddenly remembered us.

"Keep your mouths shut, d'ye hear?  No sneakin' up to John Silver or
any one else.  And as for you, my wench--" he frowned at Moira--"keep
under cover, for your own sake as well as mine.  This is a rough
ship, a pirate ship, and----"

"Don't ye worry about Misthress O'Donnell," said Darby loyally.
"I'll see to her."

"Oh, ye will!"

Flint laughed.

"You're beginning young, Darby.  Gut me, what a lad!  Well, you keep
her out o' harm's way, and when we divide the treasure maybe there'll
be an extry allowance for ye.  How'd ye like to have her, eh?"

"She'll be better worth the havin' than all the treasure there is,"
flashed Darby.  "And do ye be mindin' what I'm afther tellin' ye,
Cap'n Flint.  If harm comes to her, or sorrow into the heart of her,
'twill be the end o' your luck--aye, lucky ye'll be do ye come off
wi' a neck ye can breathe through."

Flint went pale.

"Now, now, Darby," he wheedled.  "Don't ye talk that reckless way.
'Tain't good for our luck.  And I ha' been main kind to ye, and----"

"'Tis you would be the ruin of our luck," said Darby.  "All I'm for
tellin' ye is to be gentle in handlin' an eligant young maid as ye
ought to be on your two knees before this moment for the throuble and
sore dismay ye ha' wrought wi' her."

"She's safe enough, Darby," Flint answered.  "I'd never harm her.
We'll keep her until we ha' lifted what's buried on the Dead Man's
Chest, and then she and her two buckos can take a small boat and fare
how they please, and----"

"And I'll be with 'em," added Darby.

"Oh, no, not you, Darby!  Think o' all the red gold ye'll have aboard
the _Walrus_.  And there's your luck we'll still need."

"Me luck!" fumed Darby.  "May the ---- curse me luck!  'Tis more of a
nuisance than a help."

"Ah, that's no way to talk."

Flint was nigh frantic.

"Lad, would ye lose all your red head has brought us?  And look ye,
too, if the maid's to be safe, 'tis I alone can keep her so, for
wi'out me there'll be ---- to pay, and none to stall the reckoning."

"And that before this glass is out," affirmed Bones with saturnine
emphasis.

The mate knocked the neck off a flask of rum with his cutlass-hilt
and poured the equivalent of a water-glass down his throat, gurgling
it lustily that he might secure the full savor of the fiery liquor.

"I'll take the rest o' that!" exclaimed Flint eagerly.  "Aaa-aah!
There's naught like good rum to put heart in a man, Bill.  Here,
Darby, you finish it.  That's the lad!  And don't talk no more about
losin' your luck.  We're goin' to need that luck mighty bad these
next few days.  Aye, this very day, as Bill says.  For here's Tom
Allardyce and a batch o' chicken-hearted ---- ---- a-cryin' we should
be satisfied wi' what we got, disband and save our necks.  And I
don't know what more bilge-slush."

"'Tain't Allardyce I'm 'feared of," said Bones wisely, "but Silver.
He's got a head on his shoulders, Long John has, and all the men'll
listen to him after the way he carried the stockade."

Flint nodded.

"True for you; but what you're amiss on is that John feels same as I
do about disbandin'.  After the treasure's all lifted, look out for
squalls.  But right now, Bill, Silver's as strong for pullin'
together as you and me."

"Maybe," said Bones with more of doubt than conviction.

"Maybe?  Gut me for a lubber if I'm not right."

Flint rose from the seat he had assumed.

"You come along on deck, and I'll show ye.  You, too, Darby.  No, no,
lad--" when Darby would have hung back--"I want ye by me.  I tell ye
that red head o' yours is the best beacon I ever steered by."

At the exit to the companionway he halted and spoke to us over his
shoulder:

"You mind what I said about the girl.  Keep her under cover."

"Must we all remain below decks?" I demanded with some heat.

"That's as ye may happen to feel," he replied carelessly.  "So long
as ye don't try to suck up to any o' my men and make trouble you can
go and come around the ship; but let me find ye up to mischief, and
treasure or no treasure, I'll keelhaul ye."

His green eyes twinkled evilly.

"Maybe Murray told ye what that might mean."

He gave Darby a push before him.

"Run out and call the men aft," he commanded.  "That's the boy!
Bill, ---- ye for a low-hearted ---- ----, plaster a grin on that mug
o' yours and pipe up a song.  We mustn't let them swabs for'ard
figure us to be worried none, eh?"

And his voice boomed hollow betwixt the confined walls of the
companionway:

  "Oh, a fine, tall ship was the _Elephant_
    As ever sailed the seas;
  She came down-Channel apast Ushant
    Bound for the East Indies.

  "And Dicky Lamb, he says to the crew--
    He was the bosun's mate--
  Tickle my guts!  Will ye do what I do?
    Be game, says I; tempt fate!'"


Bones joined valiantly in the sweep of the tune:

  "We are forty-five before the mast,
    And ten green clerks berthed aft,
  With the cap'n, the cook, the mates and last,
    Simmy, the boy, who's daft.

  "That's fifteen hands against forty-five.
    Christ!  What an easy lay!
  We'll take 'em at night, and dead or alive,
    Pitch 'em in Biscay Bay.

  "Oh, that was a night the wind howled free,
    The sails froze to the mast,
  And Dicky Lamb and the Portugee,
    They bound the cap'n fast."


They were out on deck now, and Flint stayed the song long enough to
roar:

"Lay aft, ye swabs!  Ye asked for a fo'csle council, and ye shall
have it.  ---- me, Bill, can't ye sing louder?"

"Louder!" I muttered to Moira and Peter.  "Certes, ye might hear them
on the Spyglass."

"Ssh!" reproved Moira.  "I will be wanting to hear the rest of it.
There, Darby is singing now--and others."

A score of voices took up the savage lilt:

  "Sandy Grant bashed the mate in the head
    And dropped him overside.
  The second mate they stabbed abed,
    And so the ten clerks died.

  "The cook they choked on his own salt pork;
    But Simmy they couldn't find,
  For Simmy was daft, and their evil talk
    Had addled his feeble mind.

  "He groped his way to the darkest hold,
    With ax and bit and saw,
  And laughed with glee as the waters rolled
    In through the hole he tore.

  "Oh, that was the end of the _Elephant_--
    She's under the Biscay seas,
  And she'll never more slant past Ushant,
    Bound for the East Indies."


By the time they came to the last verse the whole crew must have been
singing.  The roar of voices made the dishes quiver on the table
before us.

"A proper song, 'The _Elephant_," commented Flint's voice.  "Barrin'
'Fifteen Men' 'tis the best I know.  I ain't no preacher, but I can't
help bearin' in mind that every crew has some feller like Simmy, some
feller as always wants to scuttle the prize for his own satisfaction,
and never mind what his mates thinks."

There was no answer to this, only the slapping of bare feet on the
deck and the rustle of men crowded close together.

"Well, speak up, fo'csle," he went on with a note of satire.  "What
d'ye seek?  I've heard tell as how there was talk of givin' me the
Black Spot--whatever that may be--and sailin' home by your lones and
dead reckonin'.  What's the argyment, I say?"

The companionway acted like a voice-tube to carry the deck-noises to
our ears; but hearing was not the same as seeing, so Peter and I
persuaded Moira to slip into her stateroom and ourselves advanced to
a position immediately inside the doorway issuing upon the main deck,
where the council was being held.

The scene was almost identical with that which I had witnessed a few
nights previously when I spied upon Flint's preparations to surprize
Murray.  Flint sat, as he had then, upon an upturned barrel, with
Bones, Silver, Pew and two or three more.  The remainder of the crew
were squatted on the deck, a semicircular pattern of coppery faces
and tattooed chests.  The weather had turned warm after the storm,
and practically all of them wore Darby's costume, a pair of trousers
or breeches, usually slashed off above the knees.

Foremost in the ring of seamen was a tall, lanky fellow with rather
long, yellow hair and a belligerent expression.  'Twas he who
sustained the burden of the debate with Flint, supported to some
extent by a group of a score or so, who sat behind him.

"Aye, aye, Tom Allardyce," Flint was saying as we reached our aerie.
"You was the man all against attackin' Murray."

"Wasn't I right?" retorted Allardyce.  "Didn't all happen as I said
it would?  Butchered, we was."

"Everything don't go right from the beginnin'," answered Flint.  "But
just look where we be now, mates."

"It ain't your doin'," asserted Allardyce.  "'Twas only blind luck as
the storm wrecked Murray and we rode it out."

"Ah!" said Flint agreeably.  "Luck is right.  The very words I'd use
myself, Allardyce.  For see ye, 'tis luck counts for the most, and I
ha' been main lucky o' late.  No man can deny that.  Whatever I put
my hand to turns out well."

This received a murmur of endorsement, and the yellow-haired man
cried out----

"Luck is well enough, but all luck comes to an end, and I am saying
that ye ha' stretched yours overthin, cap'n."

"That's moderate," admitted Flint.  "I'd say myself as I'm for
doublin' my luck.  Ye see, mates--" he appealed to the several
hundred men who thronged the deck--"my luck has won us eight hundred
thousand pounds, and I'm for using it to win eight hundred thousand
pounds more.  And that's askin' less o' luck than ye might think,
seein' the heaviest part is accomplished.  We ha' three prisoners as
know the secret o' Murray's cache, and all we need do is sail to the
Dead Man's Chest, land a party and ferry the stuff aboard."

"Aye, and s'pose a frigate jumps us?" called one of the men sitting
with Allardyce.

"Depends on the frigate, man," answered Flint equably.  "A Spanisher
I'd fight.  A King's ship I'd run from.  A Frenchy--I don't know."

"The ship's foul.  We couldn't run," said Allardyce.  "No, mates, I
say we ha' eight hundred thousand pounds, and we'd better be
satisfied wi' that.  'Tis a couple o' thousand pounds apiece."

"Aye, aye," came from a number of men.  "Disband while the luck's wi'
us."

"Disband wi' eight hundred thousand pounds more as good as in our
pockets!" exclaimed Flint.  "I never heard crazier talk."

"Better live wi' eight hundred thousand pounds than lose a third o'
us to win twice that," insisted Allardyce doggedly.

"Not while I ha' aught to say about it!" roared Flint.  "Gut me if
I'll lose riches we all ha' worked and fought for just to please a
handful o' swabs as haven't got the courage to risk a bit more."

There were expressions of opinion both ways upon this; the company
was fairly well divided.  And Allardyce proceeded to press his
advantage.

"If ye talk about losin' riches, cap'n, 'tis you are willing to risk
losing the eight hundred thousand pounds we have in hand.  Ye'd go
for the other treasure and most likely lose what we already have."

Flint squinted reflectively at the yellow-haired man.

"Now that might be a good argyment, Allardyce, if 'twas true," he
remarked.  "But it ain't.  The truth is, I am all for makin' the
treasure we have safe before we go cruisin' to the Dead Man's Chest.
Treasure is a poison on shipboard if ye ain't got a sure use for it.
That's why I had ye leave ashore the lot Murray moved to the
blockhouse.  It's out o' the ship."

Allardyce lost his temper.

"Aye, ye want it where ye can get your hand on it, and give us the
slip!"

"How'd I do that, Allardyce?" inquired Flint softly.

"If I knowed how you were plannin' to do it I'd stop ye."

"Ah, stop me, would ye?"

"I would!  There's other men ha' marooned or murdered the half o' a
ship's company that there might be fewer to share in the prize."

"That's kindly of ye," said Flint.  "I take that real kindly!
There's some, Allardyce, as might draw pistol for that.  No, no, put
up your weapon!  I'm a-goin' to prove to ye, whether ye like it or
not, that I mean well by ye.  I'll tell ye what I'll do.

"First off, mates--" he addressed the whole crew--"do ye or don't ye
want to win eight hundred thousand pounds more wi'out havin' to fight
for it?"

A fair majority were in favor of this.

"Second, mates, are ye willin' as the treasure we have shall be
buried here on the Rendezvous until we ha' fetched back the part
that's on the Dead Man's Chest?"

"Who's to bury it?" put in Allardyce sullenly.  "'Tis easy for a few
men to bury treasure so's none save theirselves can find it--and if
they disappear suddenlike, what'll their shipmates do?"

"There's sense in that," agreed Flint.  "Let's say as you and me bury
it, Allardyce."

The yellow-haired man shook his head.

"There'd be one o' us come back--and 'twouldn't be me."

"Got a great idea o' me, ain't ye?" mocked Flint.  "But s'posin' ye
took along some friends?  Would ye feel safe then?"

"How many?"

Flint turned to Silver, whose hard eyes had been studying the faces
of both parties to the debate.

"How many would ye say, Long John?"

Silver's big face split in a smile of derisive quality.

"Seein' as you're one o' the party, cap'n, maybe we might say
five--six includin' himself."

"Ye think he'd be safe from me wi' five friends along?" asked Flint
earnestly.

"Six is a good number for buryin' treasure," replied Silver, grinning
broader than ever.  "And with you 'twould be seven--and seven's
lucky."

Flint regarded him admiringly.

"Wouldn't ye know 'twould take Long John to think o' that?  Seven is
lucky, says he!  Ah, yes, and who for?  Well, Allardyce, what d'ye
say?  Will ye feel safe wi' six friends?"

Several men laughed.

"Yes," answered the yellow-haired man.

"Then that's settled," said Flint.  "Pick 'em now.  We'll start
settin' the treasure ashore at once.  You and your friends and me,
we'll go off soon as that's finished.  Bill Bones will take command
o' the _Walrus_.  Bill, ye'd better take her out east o' the island
and stand off and on, weather permitting.  If ye lie up here wi'
naught to do, there'll be trouble, and men will be comin' ashore, and
so we'll get no work done."

"How long will ye be?" asked Bones, smiling in a knowing way.

Flint hailed Allardyce, who was already deep in conversation with his
group of supporters.

"How long d'ye figure it should take to stow away the two lots of
treasure, Allardyce?  We'll put the gold and coined silver in one
cache and the bar silver in another."

"How do I know?" snarled Allardyce.

"'How does he know?' says he," Flint echoed gravely.  "Tell ye what,
Bill, you just stand off and on like I said, and when we're ready to
come aboard we'll row out o' the Anchorage.  That's simple enough,
ain't it?  No chance for misunderstandin' or aught goin' wrong."

Peter and I ducked into our stateroom as the two came aft.  They went
into Bones' room, which was next to Moira's, and for some time we
could hear them talking in low tones.  When they came out Flint was
saying:

"Mind, Bill, an easy rein, but give 'em no slack.  And leave the
wench alone.  'Twould only make endless trouble wi' the crew."

Bones replied with a blistering string of curses.

"And ye were a fool," he wound up, "to let Long John make odds o' six
to one.  Why, even Murray----"

"Stow that!"

I could feel an edge of temper to Flint's voice.

"I'm sick o' hearing you prate Murray this and Murray that.  I'll
show this crew that Flint's way is as sure as Murray's."

"It's plum duff to Silver if aught happens to ye," remonstrated the
mate.

"Don't ye worry, Bill.  There'll be no man in this crew willing to
lift a finger after I come aboard again.  Where's my Flemish
pistolets?"

When they were finally gone I looked an unspoken question at Peter.

"_Ja_," he said.

"But six to one!  Why?"

"He wants der treasure where only he can reach it.  _Ja_, dot's it."

The morning of the sixth day I was awakened by a considerable clamor
on the deck, and Darby McGraw danced into my stateroom, so excited
that his brogue was nigh incomprehensible.

"Haste ye!  Haste ye, Master Bob!" he cried.  "'Tis Flint comin' off,
and him by his lone."

I roused Peter, and we threw on our clothes and ran out upon the
maindeck, which was crammed with pirates, staring in rapt suspense
across the sta'b'd bulwarks.  The sun was just rising, and the island
shelved upward, darkly portentous, from the creamy lather of the
surf.  The _Walrus_ was standing south, with the White Rock on her
sta'b'd quarter and the entrance to Captain Kidd's Anchorage ahead.
Outside the entrance, and pulling to meet us, was the gig we had left
behind for the convenience of Flint and his companions.  A single
figure with a light-blue scarf wrapped around his head, rowed at the
oars.

"But how be certain 'tis Flint!" I exclaimed.  "His back is toward
us, and at this distance----"

"Beggin' your pardon, Master Ormerod," said Silver at my elbow, "we
ha' made him out wi' glasses.  Bill--" he waved his free hand toward
the poop, where Bones strode up and down by the helmsman--"is sure o'
him."

The one-legged man sniggered and lowered his voice.

"Ye ain't surprized, are ye?" he asked.

"Six to one!" was all I could think to say.

"_Ja_," agreed Peter, chuckling.

Silver sniggered again.

"Aye, six to one.  A strong, desperate feller is Flint.  Now what
d'ye reckon he'll do wi' the map?"

"What map?"

"When ye bury treasure ye draws a map," Silver explained oracularly.
"If so be as one man knows where 'twas buried and he has the map that
treasure is safe till doomsday--'nless some one else gets the map."

"Well, he won't give me the map," I returned shortly.

"No-oo-o, it ain't likely.  But if he ever stows it where ye can lay
your hands on it or ye see him give it to anybody else you just
remember as Long John stands your friend, gentlemen.  Friend is the
word, remember.  And the old saw says as a friend in need is a friend
indeed."

His black eyes glinted icily as they rested in turn upon Peter's face
and mine.  Then he stumped aft, shouting:

"Rig them boatfalls, mates.  Stand by to hoist the cap'n's gig
aboard."

Presently we rounded into the wind and came to, and Flint pulled
under our lee, rowing slowly, with long, leisurely strokes like a man
who is very weary but intent upon finishing a difficult undertaking.
Now that he was so close we could see that the scarf around his head
was crusted with blood.  His coat and shirt were torn to shreds, and
his shoes and stockings gummed with mud.

A man heaved him a couple of lines, and he knotted them carefully to
bow and stern before he began to climb the cleats of the side ladder,
moving stiffly but with unerring precision.  As his face lifted above
the bulwarks the men nearest to him gasped and trod back upon the
toes of those behind them.  Such a face I have never seen.  'Twas not
alone the terrible blue color and the congested veins that bulged
redly under the skin, but a suggestion of experiences beyond the pale
of ordinary human understanding.  His eyes glared savagely.  His
mouth was fixed in a grimace of hatred.  In his tanned cheeks were
riven lines of fear, of anger, of revenge, of cupidity, of insensate
ambition--aye, and of remorse.

He dropped to the deck and peered watchfully around him.

"Well, here I be," he croaked.  "Ho, you Darby, fetch me a bottle o'
rum.  Yarely, lad!"

Darby skipped away on his errand, white-cheeked and shaking.

Nobody spoke, and Flint laughed--oh, dreadfully!

"Ye ain't glad to welcome your skipper back, eh?  How'd ye make out,
Bill?"

Bones had shouldered a path through the clustering ranks, but even he
was speechless before Flint's ghastly figure.

"We--we--we're all right," he stuttered finally.

Silver, only, seemed unimpressed.

"Ye were seven as went ashore, cap'n," he said apologetically, "and
one to return aboard."

Flint laughed that dreadful laugh a second time.

"Aye, there's six stayed ashore, Silver; six tall fellows.  Six, says
you, and seven's lucky.  Aye, lucky!  Main lucky!  And Allardyce says
he's safe wi' six!  Ho, ho, ho!"

"Where--where--are they?" questioned Bones.

"Ashore, I told ye, Bill.  All safe ashore."

"Dead?" pressed Bones.

"Aye, dead as Harry Morgan--or Avery."

Darby dived through the jam with an open bottle of rum, and Flint
stretched out both arms and tossed men right and left to make way for
the lad.

"Rum!" he exclaimed.  "That's what I need.  Rum--and plenty of it!"

He bent back his head, put the bottle to his lips and drank--and
drank.  You could hear the gurgle of it as it trickled down his
gullet.

"Aaaa-aah!" he breathed.  "That was rare stuff.  Get me another,
Darby."

He tossed the bottle overboard, and started to sing a stave of that
savage sea-song which was the chief delight of the crew:

  "Tom Avery died of a cutlass slash--
    Yo-ho-ho and a bottle o' rum!
  Mounseer Tessin felt the galleys' lash--
    Yo-ho-ho, and a bottle o' rum!


"But the treasure," spoke up Silver.  "What'd ye do wi' it, cap'n?"

Flint eyed him for as long as 'twould take to count twenty.  And I am
bound to say Silver met his eye unflinchingly.

"Why, 'tis safe, John," answered Flint in the horribly soft tones he
had employed with Allardyce.  "All tucked where it'll stay safe."

"Aye, but where?" persisted Silver.

Flint's blue, mottled visage became convulsed with a passion words
can not describe.

"Where?" he mouthed.  "Aye, where?  Ask on, man!  Or seek it, if ye
wish.  Aye, go ashore.  Lay off those ropes," he shouted to the men
at the falls to which his gig was hitched.  "There's a boat," he went
on.  "There's tools on the island.  Ye can have food and rum.  Go
ashore if ye like, and stay--any o' ye!  Search for the treasure till
---- opens wide for ye.  But as for the ship, she'll beat up for
more, by thunder!"

He waited a moment, but no man accepted his challenge.  Silver,
indeed, stumped deliberately out of the crowd, with a far-away look
in his eyes that were as bright and hard as a pair of polished
buttons.

"That's well," said Flint.  "The course is so'west by south, Bill.
We're for the Dead Man's Chest.  All sail, and a lookout in every
top!"




CHAPTER XXII

"FETCH AFT THE RUM, DARBY MCGRAW!"

Murray had predicted that the looting of the _Sanctissima Trinidad_
would send the frigates to sea from Santo Domingo, St. Pierre, the
Havana and Kingston, and the adventures of the _Walrus_ furnished
ample confirmation of his words.  Six days' sail to the southward we
raised the tops'ls of a lofty stranger whom the lookouts identified
as a King's ship.

Flint, summoned from his perpetual debauch in the main cabin, agreed
with them and ordered the helm put over.  The _Walrus_ headed west,
and the stranger followed her.  She clung to us through the day and
night, and in the morning our glasses revealed the ominous belt of
gunports of a sixty-gun razee.  But like all English second-rates,
she was clumsy in the water; and Flint was a good seaman, if nothing
else.  He contrived to keep beyond cannonshot and during the second
night shifted his course cleverly and gave our pursuer the slip.

Yet he dared not turn back immediately, and we held on northeast into
the track of the Spanish _flotas_, passing four ships westbound in
the three days we continued upon this course.  On the fourth day
Flint deemed himself safe from the razee, the _Walrus_ went about and
he resumed his solitary rum-swigging in the cabin, drinking bottle
after bottle the day long, cursing and singing and shouting his
bloody tales and chanteys to an invisible audience that sat or fought
with him.

For us three prisoners the _Walrus_ was a floating bedlam.  Moira
might not stir from her stateroom unless it be at night when Flint
occasionally slept and the most of the crew were carousing in the
fo'csle; but she never complained of the confinement that washed the
color from her cheeks, and retained her buoyant spirits despite the
hideous danger which shadowed her every hour.

Without Darby she would have been in even worse case.  'Twas he spied
out the moments she could venture abroad and thrust himself
dauntlessly betwixt her and any threats.  He carried her such food as
she would eat and often did the same for us, for Flint was become
subject to seizures of ungovernable ferocity, in the grip of which he
distrusted all aboard the ship saving Bill Bones and Darby, and was
in terror of unseen presences that lurked about the cabin's corners
and mowed at him from the stern windows.

In these seizures he would take his pistols and shoot in every
direction, regardless of who might be present, or with his hanger he
would hack at the walls and pursue imaginary enemies along the
companionway.  But for Darby he would have slain Ben Gunn, and he did
actually cut down one unfortunate fellow who goggled at him as he
stamped out upon the deck, foaming and mouthing defiance of the
ghosts that tormented him.

Darby alone could handle him.  Bones he trusted, but would brook no
interference from; Darby, however, could talk to him freely and
sometimes curb his violence, providing rum was forthcoming whenever
he demanded it.

In the latitude of the Windward Passage a Spanish line-ship and two
frigates blundered upon us unexpectedly out of a bank of mist.  There
was naught to do but run, and again Flint rallied to the emergency.
That day we held our own; but in the night a moderate gale blew up,
and the seventy-four was able to carry canvas that would have ripped
the masts from the _Walrus_.

At dawn she opened with her chase-guns, and for five glasses Flint
must jockey his ship to dodge the eighteen-pounder shot.  Then the
wind moderated, and as we hoisted sail after sail we commenced to
draw away from the big Spaniard.  She was a lubberly craft, and her
captain was no man to develop her possibilities--as her gunners were
unable to get upon a bouncing target in those slashing head seas.
The frigates even yet, I think, might have overhauled us, but they
were afraid to close and engage by themselves.

In the night Flint attempted to escape his pursuers as he had the
King's ship by heading west toward the empty gulf of the Atlantic.
But the Spaniards were prepared for this maneuver.  They had spread
out to cover a wide area of sea, with the result that we passed
almost under the bows of one of the frigates, and the flashes of her
guns warned her consorts where we were.

Undismayed, Flint varied the trick the next night, lying to in that
dark hour which comes before moonrise, and they passed us without
suspecting the ruse.  By morning we were leagues away on our
back-track, and Flint boasted of his luck until he became maudlin,
sprawling upon the cabin-table in a mess of broken meats and glasses
that must have sickened any sensible man.

He had a sorry awakening from his fool's dream two days later when a
stately French forty-four showed herself at our heels.  Ah, she was a
greyhound!  Every foot of her hull was molded for speed, and her
rakish spars were clothed with a sail area that drove her a good
three leagues to the glass.  Bones, with Darby to aid him, pulled
Flint away from the cabin-table and threw buckets of sea-water over
him to unlock the fetters the rum had fastened upon his brain.  And
he staggered on deck, cursing like a fiend, to squint his bloodshot
eyes over the stern rail.  In a moment he was cold sober.

"Gut me, 'tis a Frenchy!  We're his meat, mates.  But we'll sell for
our own price, eh?  Pipe all hands to quarters, Bill.  Cast loose and
provide."

There was muttering amongst the crew.  This was what Allardyce had
foretold, and the survivors of his group of protestants were not slow
to exploit the opportunity.  But the majority of the men went to the
guns as doggedly determined as Flint.

"Fight, ye dogs!" he bade them from the poop, swaying his mottled
blue jowl from side to side.  "'Tis a noose or the galleys for ye the
one way, and Davy Jones' locker the other.  Betwixt the two ye may
win free if ye fight.  But wi'out fighting ye are ruined men."

The Frenchman disdained to use his chase-guns, so confident was he of
bringing us to action at broadside range; but all the forenoon the
breeze dwindled, and at midday both ships were caught in a dead calm.
The frigate put out her boats, and so did we, and at once the
advantage shifted in our favor.  For 'twas one thing to tow a great
forty-four, loaded with vast weight of metal, men and stores, and
entirely a different task to tow the _Walrus_, of two-thirds the bulk
and practically unladen below the gundeck.  Moreover, the French
sailors were in no wise so hardy or so desperate as the pirates, who
knew that their chances of life were in proportion to the distance
they extended betwixt the two vessels.

Flint swaggered around the fo'csle, swearing and urging on the men in
the boats like the spectator of a horse-race who has staked more than
he can afford upon the issue.

"We'll make it, ---- me," he would say.  "My luck's with us, I tell
ye all.  Here, Darby, jump on to the bulwarks and let 'em see your
red head.  Mark him, men!  There's luck for ye.  There don't live the
man can stop me whilst the lad's with us."

And he would brandish his hanger at the towering sails of the
frigate, lying slack against the yards, just out of cannonshot, and
burst into the wildest imprecations and challenges.

"No Frenchman'll pull down John Flint!  Aye, ---- ---- me for a ----
---- ---- if he will!  I tell ye I ha' luck.  Look to what I ha'
done.  There were three after us but two days since, and we lost 'em
as we'll lose yon fellow."

His promises were justified amazingly.  In the course of the
afternoon we gained a hard-won league; and that night under cloak of
darkness we stole silently north before a freshening wind, which by
morning was a tempest.  The French frigate disappeared, making the
best of the heavy weather, and the _Walrus_ was blown north and west
for five days, past the latitude of Spyglass Island, past the
scattered rocks and cays of the Bahamas, past the Floridas.
Impossible now to watch for the tall spars of fighting-ships--as
impossible as it would have been to fight them or for them to fight
us, with the gray waves toppling mainyard high and the gunports
buried half the time.

Flint had only dead reckoning to go by, for low-hung clouds and black
banks of rain obscured sun and stars.  Literally we did not know
where we were, and our lookouts were peering through the scud for a
landfall in the Bermoothes the morning the storm flailed itself to
pieces.

It was this morning that the fever first appeared in our midst.  I
can still see the look, half-doubt, half-misgiving, in Silver's face
as he heaved himself aft by one of the life-lines which grilled the
maindeck and hailed Flint on the poop.

"There's ten lads groanin' in their hammocks, cap'n."

"Take your crutch to 'em," snapped Flint.

"Them lads is sick," answered Silver.  "Bellyaches and headaches
a-twistin' em in knots."

"They're soldierin' so as not to have to go aloft," returned Flint.
"But if you're afraid of 'em, I'm not."

The first of the sick men he prodded with his hanger already was
dead, and he hastened back to the cabin and fortified himself anew
with rum.  I heard him mumbling to Bones as he entered the
companionway:

"It's main queer, Bill.  I don't like it.  Maybe my luck ain't good
against sickness."

"Maybe," answered Bones.  "What ha' ye done wi' the map?"'

Flint's teeth gritted together.

"If I thought ye----"

"Belay there, John.  I'm only thinkin' as if ye was sick some o' them
swabs for'ard might try and come by it."

"Don't ye worry about that," advised Flint grimly.  "It's safe--and
it will stay safe."

A second man died the next day, and there were eighteen sick instead
of ten.  A panic possessed the crew, and Silver mustered a fo'csle
council of frightened pirates, who whispered and nudged each other as
they gazed awestruck at Flint's congested visage atop of the barrel
which was his official throne.  Thorough scoundrels themselves, they
accorded him the sincere respect which was the due of one who utterly
surpassed them in wickedness.  He was "a rare 'un," "a main desperate
rogue"; "lead and steel was same as bread and meat to him."

"What'll ye have?" he growled.

"Well, 'tis this way, cap'n," Silver broached diplomatically.  "The
crew feels as the fever comes from the ship bein' foul and so long at
sea----"

"We ain't been long at sea."

"Maybe not so long from the Rendeyvoo, but we ain't careened or
cleaned ship this year."

"Whose fault is that?"

"It ain't nobody's fault.  But it do seem as if we'd oughter run into
some likely port where we could get sweet water and greens and check
the fever before it runs through the crew."

"There's a many ports we could make," commented Flint sarcastically.

"We could allus head up for the island," interposed a man.

"So's ye could go for to dig up the treasure we just stowed away,"
snorted Flint.  "Not if I know it!"

"There ain't been talk o' the island," said Silver hastily.  "But
what would ye say to the Bermoothes?"

"Too many reefs to pile ourselves on--and Hamilton is a port o' call
for the King's ships."

"Them's the very words I said myself!" exclaimed Silver.  "And what
would ye say to Savannah, cap'n, which same is a quiet spot and has
no garrison, seein' as Georgy is the newest o' all the colonies in
Ameriky?"

Flint reached down to the deck beside him and lifted a bottle of rum
to his mouth, going through the usual performance of draining it at
one colossal gulp to the considerable admiration of the crew.

"Aaa-aah," he muttered, wiping his lips with the back of his hand.
"Savannah, eh?  That might do.  But mind ye, men, I'll ha' no talk o'
disbandment there or elsewhere.  We'll stop by to clean up the fever
and water, and when that's done we'll square off south and collect
what's comin' to us on the Dead Man's Chest.  I'm a man o' my word!"

Silver made quick assent.

"Fairly put.  And the while we're lyin' off Savannah the frigates
will be a-wearin' themselves out on false scents.  It works both
ways, cap'n."

"It'll work my way," rapped Flint.

He slid off the barrel, balanced dizzily for a moment and walked into
the companionway under the poop.

"Darby McGraw!" he called harshly.  "Ho, Darby, fetch aft the rum."

That night he had another of his fits, declaring that Andrew Murray
was come aboard to slay him.  He chased Bones from the cabin, hanger
in hand, and was for setting upon the watch on deck when Darby
restrained him with a bottle of rum, asserting it to contain Murray's
heart's blood.  Flint tossed it off with howls of infernal glee and
retired to snore on the cabin floor, twitching and foaming at the
mouth in his slumber like one possessed.  The next day as we rolled
in the oily swell under a torrid sun with the pitch pricking up in
bubbles from the seams, the fever laid its hot hand upon him.

"Don't ye look at me that way, Gonzalez," he would scream.  "Here,
Bill, what kind o' shipmate are you to be lettin' old Ross in here
wi' his bloody throat?"

And then he would turn pious.

"Ah, now, mother, ye'd not ha' me bide home all my days like a baby,
would ye?  Look at these gold jos.  Ain't they pretty?  I'll wager ye
ain't got a friend as has a son can fetch her stuff the like o' that!
No, no; don't ye ask no questions.  Oh, dear Christ, what a pain I
got!  God, God, don't ye let me go this way.  I'll build a chapel
home to Tewkesbury when I find Murray's cache.  A million and a half
pounds, God; aye, that and more--and just you 'n' me to share it, wi'
some for Bill Bones and Darby, as is a good lad and lucky."

He babbled childishly of his luck.

"Ye wouldn't break my luck, God!  Oh, Ye wouldn't!  There never was
none like John Flint to rove the seas, John Flint as outwitted old
Murray and was the end of him."

The droning voice would ramble on day and night, with intervals of
exhausted sleep, punctuated by awful, explosive screams:

"Ho, Darby!  Darby McGraw!  Fetch aft the rum, Darby!"

And again:

"I'm a-burnin' in my guts, Darby.  Ye wouldn't leave me to burn.
Fetch me a noggin o' rum!"

Other times he would sing, and always the one song that had been my
introduction to his company:

  "Bellamy's hangin' all dried and brown--
    Yo-ho-ho, and a bottle o' rum!
  A-rattlin' his chains by Kingston town--
    Yo-ho-ho, and a bottle o' rum!"


But words cannot describe the horrors of the week which succeeded.
For five days men died at the rate of three a day.  Then the disease
seemed to diminish in virulence, and although we had as many as
seventy sick at once, practically all survived.  As a rule, men who
were stricken either perished within twenty-four hours or else made a
slow recovery.  Flint was one of the few exceptions, and I can only
suppose that in his case the illness resolved itself into a battle
betwixt a naturally sinewy frame and the weaknesses developed by the
strong liquors with which it had been saturated.

That we three and Darby were untouched I attribute as much as
anything to the measures which Peter took.  He brewed a drastic
purgative of rum, molasses and gunpowder, and he was insistent that
Darby should procure a large earthen crock to contain boiled water
which we kept in Moira's stateroom.  Bones, Silver, Pew and those
others of the crew who escaped the infection did so simply because of
their physical vigor or perhaps because they were so accustomed to
living in filth that the exaggerated conditions aboard the _Walrus_
might not harm them.

A week from the day we steered westward we sighted the mouth of a
broad river, crossed a bar at high tide and bore upstream between
low, sandy shores overgrown with pine forests.  On the verge of
evening we rounded a point of land and dropped our anchor opposite a
little, log-built town perched on a sandy bluff.

A huddle of merchant shipping eyed askance the splintered sides and
serried ports of the _Walrus_, and there was a general tendency to
slacken anchor-cables and allow us ample room.  Ashore men scurried
to and fro; several small cannon were run out upon the platform of
the stockade, and the British flag was displayed.

Peter and I had seized the opportunity of the semidarkness to escort
Moira to the rail for a view of our new surroundings, and we were
staring hungrily at this outpost of civilization when the thud-thud
of Silver's crutch sounded on the deck behind us.

"Ye might think from them goin's-on ashore as there was a mighty
treasure in Savannah," he observed; "but bless ye, there ain't enough
worth the takin' in that town to pay for the gunpowder to blow down
the stockade."

I assented, and Flint's voice came faintly through the twilight:

  "Fifteen men on the Dead Man's Chest--
    Yo-ho-ho, and a----


"Ho, Darby!  Darby McGraw!  Fetch aft the rum, Darby McGraw!"

"He's main bad, Flint is."

Silver thrust a thumb over his shoulder.

"Won't hardly last till mornin', Bill says."

"Oh, poor soul!" exclaimed Moira.  "And him with so much wickedness
to answer for!  I am thinking he will have a great need of prayers,
so if you will be after taking me below, Bob----"

"Bide a moment, mistress," interrupted Silver.  "Ha' ye seen aught o'
the map, Master Ormerod?"

"No," I answered briefly.  "And I'll not be involved in your quarrels
aboard this hell-ship."

"Easy, easy," he admonished me.  "Rough words won't further ye, my
gentleman.  Here's me as will be glad to stand your friend, and you
know best whether you need a friend.  Figger it out for yourselves.
Flint's as good as dead.  Who comes a'ter him--me or Bill Bones?
Which o' us would ye plump for?  Bill, he's a desp'rate villain--and
has his fish-eyes on the maid here.

"Long John, he wants treasure and a clean path home.  I'm none o'
your rum-swiggers and tavern-brawlers, gentlemen.  I ha' had
eddication, and I aims to get more.  Give me a million and a half
pounds to divvy, and I'll sack the old _Walrus_ and ride to Parlyment
in my coach, I will."

"What has that to do with us?" I demanded.

He winked.

"What has it to do with you, says you?  Ah, what!  Why, just this.
I'm your friend.  You stand by me and I'll stand by you.  There'll be
a 'lection of a cap'n, and if I knows this crew, him as has the
treasure-map will come out on top.  You get me the map, and I'll put
you ashore."

Flint called out again suddenly in a frenzy of fear:

"Bill!  Where's Bill Bones?  Stand afore me, Bill.  There's them here
I can't face."

The guttural mutter of Bones' voice answered the plea.  Silver cocked
his head on one side, hand cupped to ear, listening eagerly.  But the
words were impossible to distinguish.

"No, no, not yet, Bill," wailed Flint.  "I ain't a-goin' to die.
Where's Darby?  Here, lad, you come and sit by me.  You're my luck,
Darby.  I can't die with you by me."

Bones spoke again, and with an oath Silver cuddled his crutch in his
armpit and hopped over the deck to the companionway.

"We better go," said Peter.  "_Ja_, we take der little gal to her
room, Bob.  I don't like this."

Silver reached the door of Flint's stateroom as we stepped inside the
companionway.  We could see him distinctly in the light of the fading
sunset glow which came through the stern-windows.  Ben Gunn was
crouching by the door, with his back toward us, hugging his arms
about himself and evidently eavesdropping upon what went on in the
stateroom.  As we watched, Silver swung his right arm and dealt Gunn
a blow which knocked him head over heels into the main cabin.  The
steward emited one agonized howl and scuttled under the cabin table.
Silver wrenched open the stateroom door and poked his head inside.

"Well, well, if this ain't a touchin' picter!" he remarked.  "Bill, I
see you're doin' the kind and dootiful by our lamented skipper.  But
anybody as knowed ye would expect it of ye.  Is that the
treasure-map?"

"What are ye goin' to do about it?" snarled Bones by way of answer.

Silver backed into the companionway, as if in mute obedience to a
leveled weapon.

"Do?" he repeated.  "That depends, Bill.  We'll see what the crew has
to say."

"Aye, that we will," retorted Bones, and his voice vibrated with
undisguised triumph.  "Who's to come a'ter ye, cap'n?" he added.

"I ain't goin' to die, Bill," came Flint's mournful wail.  "Where's
the rum, Darby?  I'm a-burnin' wi' thirst."

"Who's to come a'ter ye, John?" pressed Bones remorselessly.

Silver indulged in a mocking laugh.

"Aye, he knows what to answer!"

And Flint echoed him gaspingly:

"Bill's mate.  He--has--map."

"Satisfied?" jeered Bones.

"I be, Bill," Silver assured him.  "But we'll put it to the crew
first, all fair and reg'lar.  And whatever they say, Bill, you
remember I'll be watchin' ye.  Don't try any tricks wi' that map.
I'm ready for ye, and if ye start tricks we'll put the Black Spot on
ye."

"To ---- wi' you and your Black Spot!" roared Bones.  "Get out o'
here afore I take my knife to ye."

Silver stumped toward us, his face distorted with rage.

"He has it," he rasped.  "---- him for the shifty scoundrel he is!
Well, the next move is for ye to plot, Master Ormerod."

"I see it not," I said coldly.

"Wait till he thinks o' the maid here," replied the one-legged man
and hopped out on deck.

From Flint's stateroom Darby's voice rose in protest.

"Take your hand off me, ye--  Ah, if he wants the rum do be lettin'
him have it!  Sure, what will it matther----"

"'Tain't no use wastin' good rum on a dead man," said Bones,
chuckling thickly.

There was a gurgle of liquor, and Flint moaned:

"Where's my rum?  Fetch aft the rum, Darby McGraw!"

"Ah, ye black-hearted wretch!" shrilled Darby.  "May the banshees
whistle for ye, and--  I'll not!  Beware do ye touch me, I say, or
I'll----"

The door of the stateroom crashed open again, and Darby was bundled
out into the companionway.

"'Tis bad luck, and not good, I'll wish on ye!" he screamed.

Bones' ugly face was projected from the doorway long enough to squirt
a stream of tobacco-juice at the boy.

"Be off with ye, ye red-haired rat," he growled.  "You and your luck!
Aye, 'tis fine luck ye brought to John Flint, wi' the rattles in his
throat."

"Darby McGraw!" wailed Flint.  "Ho, Darby!  Fetch aft the rum, Darby
McGraw!"

The stateroom door slammed shut on the dying man's plaint, and Darby
stood for an instant shaking his fist at its panels.

"May the priest fall dead that would be sayin' mass for your soul!"
he cursed.  "May him that offers ye bite or sup put the bitter poison
in it!  May ye never know sleep that will rest ye or kindness that--
Ah, but what will be the use of it all?  For there will be nothing
but just the fires of hell to punish one that's as bad as you."

He turned wearily and saw me, and the tears trickled down his
freckled cheeks.

"Oh, Master Bob, I doubt me the cap'n dead or close to it, and Bones
he--he--drove me forth, for--for fear I'd spy on him, says he--and
him wi' the treasure-map he blan-handered from Flint in his weakness!
By the Rock o' Cashel, I'm finished wi' pirates.  They're a poor lot.
Leave us go home."

"If we only could, Darby!" I said.

He dashed a grimy paw across his eyes and gave me one of his shrewd
looks.

"Troth, Master Bob, I'm thinkin' we're none of us like to live else,"
he answered.




CHAPTER XXIII

CAP'N BILL BONES

_Clump-clump-clump_ went the heavy sea-boots up and down the echoing
length of the companionway, and the mutter of voices beat an
accompaniment to them.

"Aye, there he lies."

"---- me, was there ever such a mug?"

"Ah, but ye'd oughter ha' seed him afore Long John put the pennies to
his eyes!"

"'Tain't right to put pennies to John Flint's eyes, him as handled
onzas like other fellers does fardin's."

"Are ye daft, mate?  Ye'd never put gold in a dead man's shroud!"

"Mebbe not!  Mebbe not!  Not to be sewed up, no."

"Ah, what's it matter?  He's dead.  The river'll have him----"

The clumping became a measured tramp as four tall seamen carried out
the canvas cylinder that had been John Flint.  A babble of grief from
Darby broke the silence.  We could hear him even where we three were
huddled in Moira's stateroom, biding what the future held for us.

"Glory be to God, and him gone overside in all his sin!  Och, St.
Bridget and St. Patrick and Blessed Veronica and Holy Mark, do ye
intercede for him!  Let ye cry upon the Virgin to be speakin' for him
in the heavenly courts.  Oh, wirra, wirra, wirra, evil he was, and
good in his way, and there's none by to give him the chance of
purgatory!"

A roar from Bones.

"Stow that guff!  Here, a pair o' ye strangle the mick if he'll not
hush."

Darby whimpered and was still.

"Down-stream," continued Bones.  "Here, to la'b'd.  Ease him up.
Where's that shot?  Is it fast?  Let him go, mates!"

A splash.

"And now who'll say as Bill Bones is not cap'n o' the _Walrus_?"
demanded Bones, gruffly menacing.

Peter touched my arm, pushing open Moira's door very gently.

"Ye'll not be leaving me?" she breathed.

"_Neen_," he denied.  "But we better hear what they do."

Bones was talking again as we stole into the deserted companionway.
He sat on the barrel which Flint had been used to occupy.  A battle
lanthorn hung over his head, and the pale yellow light showed him to
be nigh as drunk as his dead commander.

"--and to ---- wi' luck!  He was a good pal, Flint was; but he
thought too much o' luck.  I'm a seaman, I am.  Give me sun and
stars, and I'll steer ye a course.  Give me sight o' tops'ls, and
I'll fetch ye 'longside o' a prize.  I'm no man for fuss, I'm not.
Ye can ha' all the rum ye want, so be ye sail the ship and fight her.

"Now, what ha' ye to say?  Speak up, any o' you swabs as is for
trouble!"

Long John Silver spoke from the shadows, his words flowing smoothly
with an insinuating, oily inflection.

"We better make it all reg'lar, Bill.  You're mate, and you say as
how Flint give you the treasure-map and says you was to be cap'n
a'ter him; but reg'lar's reg'lar, and it don't do no harm to----"

Bones pulled a stiff, crackling sheet of map-paper from his breast,
and waved it in the air.

"Here's the map," he declared.  "Long John there was a'ter it, but
Flint give it to me, as he says."

"Sure I says it, Bill," proceeded Silver, undisturbed.  "But what I
says, too, is as we'd oughter have a 'lection as the Articles
provide."

A murmur of assent greeted this declaration.  Bones scowled.

"'Tain't necessary," he returned.  "I'm mate, and I'm the only real
navigator ye got.  But go ahead and 'lect whoever ye please--only
remember I got the treasure-map."

"Yes, you got the treasure-map, Bill," agreed Silver, and his voice
somehow became more hateful than ever.  "But we don't allow as it's
yours, ye know.  You're what the lawyer sharks calls a trustee.  You
keeps it for the rest o' us, and we--" he chuckled venomously--"why,
we keeps our eyes on you, Bill."

Bones swore.

"Get on wi' the 'lection," he adjured the crew.  "Who's to be cap'n?
Speak up and name some one!"

A dozen sycophants shouted "Bones," with a vim which inspired him
with sweating vanity, and several called out: "Silver!" and "Long
John!"

"Anybody else?" challenged Bones.

Nobody answered.

"Well, Long John," he leered, "it seems like 'twas you 'n' me.  The
Articles says them what votes for one feller goes to one side, and
them what votes for t'other goes opposite.  So, seein' as you're on
the la'b'd side, I'll say them as votes for you goes la'b'd and them
as votes for me goes sta'b'd."

"Suits me," grunted Silver.

There was a subdued rustling and patter of feet as the men divided,
and the lanthornlight revealed two unequal groups on either side of
the mizzen, with Bones sitting on his barrel between them.  Probably
three-fifths of the crew had voted for him.

"Well, Long John," he said without trying to repress the triumph in
his tones, "d'ye want to tell over the vote?"

"No," replied Silver briefly.  "You win."

Bones rubbed his hands gleefully.

"Ah, I win, do I?"

"I said yes."

The opposing factions regarded each other like packs of wolves
preparing to dispute the carcass of a fresh-killed moose.  I
suspected for an instant that they would fight, but I misjudged
Silver's self-control.  Galled he might be, but he did not permit the
sting to his pride to influence his policy.

"You win, Bill," he repeated, "and I'm the first to wish ye joy o'
it.  And seein' as you're dooly elected, s'pose you tell us what your
plans are for the ship?"

"Plans?" answered Bones warily.  "What plans might ye mean?"

"Are ye for liftin' the treasure on the two islands or beatin' up for
more?"

Bones reflected.  He was not nearly so clever as Silver, and I
imagine he knew it.  He feared a trap, but study as he might he could
not detect any pitfall behind the innocent question.

"I'll be guided by the crew," he announced triumphantly.  "You're
gentlemen adventurers, all o' ye.  Name your wishes!"

This time the crew looked instinctively to Silver for a lead.

"We got plenty o' treasure in them island caches," he replied
tentatively.  "Speakin' for myself, I'm for collectin' what we got,
takin' three or four ships and dividin' up for different countries,
accordin' to what men seek.  There's enough waitin' for our spades to
make us all comf'table for life, and them lads as wants to go on the
Account again can easy do it.  Turn over the _Walrus_ to 'em if they
fancy it.  I don't care.  But some o' us ha' had enough o' the sea,
and we'll try our ease ashore."

A shout of approval capped this speech.  There was not a man but was
lured by the prospect of thousands of pounds to spend on the right
side of the gallows.  And like all sailors after a series of hard
voyages, they never wanted to see a ship again--or so they thought.

Bones was enthusiastic for Silver's plan as any.

"Aye, aye," he applauded.  "Long John has the right idea.  We'll
water tomorrow, and then we'll try for the Dead Man's Chest."

And he began to shout drunkenly the song that Flint had died singing:

  "Fifteen men on the Dead Man's Chest--
    Yo-ho-ho, and a bottle o' rum!
  Drink and the devil had done for the rest--
    Yo-ho-ho, and a bottle o' rum!"


Other men joined in, and as if by magic pannikins of rum appeared.
Bones drank several whilst we watched.

"You drink wi' me, bullies!" he hailed his supporters.  "An easy
skipper is Bill Bones.  Rum for all, and to ---- wi' discipline!"

They howled joyfully over this, and what I had expected to provide a
free fight seemed about to develop into nothing worse than such an
orgy of intoxication as occurred almost every night aboard the
_Walrus_.  But it did not suit Silver's plans to have all restraint
cast off at that point.  He stumped forward into the circle of
lanthorn light, with Pew, Black Dog, Darby and a dozen others at his
back.

"Belay, mates," he cried.  "We got a vast task to settle here.  Time
to carouse afterward."

"There's no time for drinkin' like the time ye ha' the liquor at your
elbow," retorted Bones.

"And them's true words," assented Silver heartily.  "And 'tis plain
to be seen as you're a skipper the lads'll all be blithe for, Bill.
But I was just figgerin' as we none o' us has ever asked the
pris'ners how long 'twill take to dig up that treasure o' Murray's.
So I makes bold to suggest we have 'em up here and put 'em through
their paces.  'Tain't no ways right as pris'ners should be as
close-mouthed as Flint let 'em be.  He was a good messmate, Flint
was, but I allus thought them swabs pulled the wool a mite over his
eyes, blow me if I didn't."

I could see Bones slowly run his tongue over his lips, blinking his
eyes the while.  He liked this idea.  So did the crew.  They were in
the humor for baiting whoever were at their mercy.

"Have 'em out," ruled Bones.  "Long John's right."

"Aye, have 'em out," yelled the crew.  "Make 'em dance!"

Silver's hard, polished-agate eyes glinted around the circle of
savage faces and came to rest upon Bones' sodden visage.

"Run aft, Darby, there's the sweet lad," he said, "and bring us the
pris'ners."

"Not--not--her!" answered Darby haltingly.

"Yes, _her_," replied Silver with a slight emphasis.

And one of his hands reached out, and his strong fingers tweaked the
Irish boy's ear.  Darby yelped.

"O' course, you bring her," Silver continued.  "Why's she too good to
tell us what she knows, mates?  Just because she had Andrew Murray's
favor, I wonder!"

"Not----"

Darby started to protest again, but Silver cut him off with a word
that dripped chill ferocity.

"Skip!"

"Fetch up the wench, boy," growled Bones, "or I'll give ye a taste o'
Murray's triangles."

"Fetch her up!" howled the crew in rabid chorus.  "Let's ha' a look
at the wench!"

Darby started toward us with the tears running down his cheeks.  We
could see him picking his way slowly through the crowd.  A man kicked
him as we watched.  Poor Darby!  He had been Flint's favorite, and
there are always men in any crew to hate the captain's pet.

I looked at Peter, and he met my gaze with dumb foreboding.

"We might take to the water," I said.

Moira spoke behind us.

"You will do no such thing," she answered.  "Nor will I.  We are not
yet in such evil case."

"You don't know----"

"They would surely overtake us," she argued.  "No, no, Bob; we must
wait and pick a better time if we can."

"_Ja_," approved Peter.  "Dot's right.  I t'ink----"

He hesitated.

"Silver will be nursing some hidden plan," supplemented Moira.

"_Ja_," he said.  "How didt you know?"

"I guessed," she said.  "Glory, I will have been listening behind ye
this quarter-glass, for I had a feeling in me there was new
wickedness astir.  But here's Darby, and for his sake we'd best be
going quickly."

Darby fronted us with a gulp.

"Silver bade me----"

Moira slipped between Peter and me and dropped her hand on his
shoulder.

"Don't ye be taking heed to what they say," she comforted him.
"Faith, 'tis you are the grand knight, Darby lad, and I am that proud
o' ye I could be giving ye a bit of a kerchief or gaudy ribbon to
wear in your hat--only that ye will have no hat and me neither ribbon
nor kerchief!  But let's be after trying what the rogues want with
us."

And out she marched at the boy's side before one or the other of us
could step ahead.

The ranks of pirates parted to admit our procession, and we threaded
the shadows to the edge of the central pool of light where Silver
leaned upon his crutch.  He moved aside to make room for us, and I
found myself at his right hand.  Perhaps fifteen feet away Bones sat
on his barrel, his coarse face flushed and shiny, his cruel eyes
devouring Moira's lissome grace.  The scores of others were just so
many vague blurs to me, but Moira frowned about her with a kind of
high pride that turned the boldest stare.  Peter looked stolidly over
the heads of the throng.  It was his way when he fronted danger;
behind their mask of fat his little eyes were darting daggerwise from
face to face, probing, guessing, estimating.

Silver spoke first.

"Well, here they be, Bill."

Bones' tongue traveled the circuit of his lips twice before he
replied; he did not once take his gaze from Moira.

"A proper wench, ain't ye?" he fawned.

"Do ye tell me so!" she exclaimed.

And the pirates screeched with laughter.

"Lusty, ye are," sneered Bones.  "Ye need tamin', and I ha' a
hankerin' to take ye in hand."

"'Twould take ten of your like," retorted Moira, nose in air.

Silver interposed in the midst of a second burst of laughter.  I had
to admire the scoundrel's deftness.  He contrived to appear to be
coming to the rescue of Bones in such a way as to rouse all the man's
resentment against the cause of the implied humiliation.

"Sure, mistress," said Long John very respectfully, "what the cap'n
would know is how long it should take to shift the treasure Cap'n
Murray had ye bury on the Dead Man's Chest?"

Moira's nose remained in air.

"If ye were not afraid of the hard work it would maybe take ye as
much as the half of a watch," she answered.

He addressed me with equal respect, requiring confirmation of what
she had said.  I gave it, as did Peter.

"And is it far from the shore?" he asked her then.

"Some would say yes, and some might call it over near," she flashed.

At that Bones slid off his barrel.

"Tamin' is what I said ye needed, and tamin' is what ye'll get, my
girl," he announced.  "Leave the rest to me, Silver.  I'll take her
aft and soon find out all she knows."

"There's Rule Four, Bill," said Silver quickly.

"Blow Rule Four!  Murray and Flint wrote them blasted Articles, and
they're both dead.  Why should we, as are free gentlemen adventurers,
have any tomfool rules like we was a King's ship?  I'll take the lass
and chuck five hundred pounds o' my share o' the treasure into the
common fund in pay for her.  ---- me, lads, d'ye grudge your cap'n a
little fun?"

Men shouted, "Yes," and, "No," but nobody was inclined to interfere.

"Come on, my pretty," he invited Moira.

She met his hot eyes with level scorn.

"Do ye put your finger on me, I'll either be the death of you or
myself," she warned him.

He laughed uncertainly and started toward her, and as I lifted my
foot to step between them the hilt of a knife was thrust into my
right hand.

"Go to it," Silver's voice bade me.  "Tell him ye'll fight for her."

I finished my step automatically and found myself a pace inside the
pool of light surrounding Bones' barrel.  Bones himself had come to a
halt and was examining me with some evidence of disconcertion.

"He says he'll fight ye for her, Bill," Silver called officiously
over my shoulder, and as Bones discharged a streak of curses, he
muttered in my ear:

"Put your mark on her.  That's old buccaneer law."

And as I still hesitated, scarce understanding him and unwilling to
remove my eyes from Bones, who was drawing his own knife:

"Go on, ye fool!  Anywhere!  A cross on her hand'll do--wi' your
knife!"

Moira heard him and grasped his meaning.  She shot her left hand
under my arm.

"God be good to ye, Bob," she whispered.  "Sure, I'm yours."

And with the point of Silver's knife I traced a crimson cross upon
her palm, certes, the oddest betrothal any couple ever had.

"Mistress O'Donnell is pledged to me," I called as loudly as I could.
"Further, we had the word of Captain Flint that no harm should be
done to her or any of us."

"Flint's word was no better'n mine," grinned Bones.  "'Twas only as
Flint had no use for women, but I'm different, and first, I'm goin'
to ha' ye caught and flogged, Buckskin, and then I'll cut your ears
off for a keepsake like."

He waved his arm carelessly.

"Pull him down, mates.  I can't be bothered fightin' a pris'ner."

Several of his cronies made to obey this command; but Silver, Black
Dog and a number of others set up a protest.

"Give the Buckskin a fair show," they shouted.  "He's put his mark on
her.  Took her himself, he did, when Murray carried the _Santissima
Trinidad_."

Bones' friends hung back.  From the rear ranks of the circle came
advice and opinions of all shades.  But Silver's faction must have
been primed for the incident, for they worked up such a furor in my
support that they swayed the general opinion by sheer volume of
noise.  Silver even raised Moira's hand with the bloody cross upon it
and held it up for those behind to see.

"Fair play for all," proclaimed his stentorian voice.  "The Buckskin
was one o' Murray's crew, and he took the girl in fair fight.  He's
put his mark on her, and if he wants to fight for her he can,
pris'ner or no pris'ner."

Bones observed the mounting turmoil with an obvious mingling of
emotions.  He realized he had been tricked, but he did not yet see
how it had been done or comprehend the ulterior purpose of Silver's
strategy.  To do him justice, I do not believe that he feared me or
doubted his ability to kill me in a knife-fight, for I had never had
occasion to exhibit my skill with the knife before the pirates.  He
simply knew that he had been lured into a position where he must
fight personally to maintain his authority over the crew, and the
initial flare of his hatred was naturally directed against me.  But
he did not forget Silver.

"I'll mind this," he flung at the one-legged man as he crouched
forward to meet me, knife poised across his chest and left arm
extended to clutch at my knife-wrist or parry a stab from the side.

"'Tain't my doin's, Bill, if ye will ha' the girl," remonstrated
Silver.  "I warned ye o' Rule Four.  And the cap'n's all the same as
any other in a question o' honor."

"That's right," shouted a score of throats.  "Cap'n's got to meet
anybody."

"I'll meet some others a'ter I finish this swab," gritted Bones.

I circled away from him, gaging the effect of the swaying
lanthorn-light upon the deck shadows and the feel of the pitchy
planks underfoot.

"Stand to it, ---- ye," he snarled.  "Don't let him break from the
ring, mates.  I want his heart for that wench to chew on--and mind
the fat Dutchman doesn't jump on my back.  He's a bad 'un, he is."

Silver was prompt to summon half a dozen men to block off Peter, who,
having seen me use the scalping-knife of the frontier since
childhood, was not in any way concerned as to what I should be able
to do against a half-drunken sailor whose one idea of knife-fighting
was to grab his opponent's wrist at the same time the opponent
grabbed his, and then strain and heave until one of the pair tore
loose and struck.

"Don't ye worry, Bill," counseled the one-legged man soothingly.  "We
won't let the Dutchman nor nobody else harm ye.  Just you hop in and
gut the Buckskin--if ye can."

"If I can!" hissed Bones.  "Watch me!"

He dropped to all fours and bounded into the air in a clumsy
fashion--not at all as an Iroquois warrior would have done it,
hurtling like a projectile, with his whole body behind the knife.  I
stepped to the left and stabbed down, aiming to drive inside the
collar-bone.  But the light or something fooled me, and my blade
slashed his cheek from eye to mouth, a great searing cut that laid
open the whole side of his face.

He bellowed with surprize, and I was put out myself, for I had
thought to finish him.  Not a man moved for two or three breaths in
the circle around us, for none had expected to see the fight
terminated so quickly.  Moira told me afterward that it was comical
to see how Silver's jaw gaped.

Bones staggered back, the spurting blood blinding him so that he had
to feel his way.  I followed him slowly, half-prepared for a ruse,
and he must have heard me, for he called out:

"Don't let him slay me, mates!  I can't see, and he's a-comin' a'ter
me!"

At this a dozen pirates jolted in between us, cursing and threatening
me, and I gave ground toward where my friends were standing with
Silver.  The one-legged man hopped out to meet me.  But I had scant
satisfaction from him.  He snatched the knife from my hand and,
bending low, spat at me with a scorn words can not possibly convey:

"Ye bungler!  As good as blind, and ye didn't do for him!"

And he swung by me on his crutch, hallooing to his friends:

"They're after Black Dog yon!  Lay into the dirty swabs, mates!"

Knives were out all over the deck, and men were slashing and stabbing
at one another.  Bones was swallowed up in the mass of frantic
humanity that milled around the restricted space between the butt of
the mizzen and the rise of the poop.

A man plucked at my sleeve, and I spun about defensively to confront
Peter.

"Where's Moira?" I panted.

"Darby took her.  He has a plan for us to get free.  Hurry, Bob!  We
got a goodt chance, _ja_.  This is what Silver worked for, to hafe
you kill Bones or set der crew against him."

I noticed that Peter steered me for'ard where the deck was deserted;
but I asked no questions, for Silver's voice spurred me on.

"Lay aft, lads," he was shouting.  "We'll show 'em what!  We won't
let no perishin' fool like Bill Bones go for to hold out that
treasure-map on us.  Couldn't even handle the Buckskin, he couldn't!"

Moira hailed us from the shelter of the capstan.

"Will it be you, Bob?  Oh, thank God, thank God!"

"And your hand?" I stammered.

She pressed it to my lips.

"There!" said she.  "If you will be so chary of other places."

I strove to redress my fault, and she lay for one precious moment in
my arms.

"Are you sure ye will have meant it?" she asked shyly.

"Meant it!  Since the morning I heard the lilt of your voice in----"

A low whistle came from over the side to larboard.

"'Tis Darby!" she cried.  "He slid down the anchor-cable to get at
one of the boats they will have lowered by the side ladder for the
water-party was going ashore, and didn't."

Peter beckoned urgently from the rail.

"We don't talk," he ordered grimly.  "We go."

There was a coil of spare cable handy, and we dropped it overside,
sliding one by one into the jolly-boat which Darby held steady
beneath the heft of the bowsprit.  The _Walrus_ had swung with the
tide until her stern was toward the town, and Darby and I took the
oars and rowed quietly along the mass of the pirate's hull in the
direction of the scattered lights that represented Savannah.  How
beautiful they seemed to us, those tiny glimmers of rush-lights and
lanthorns in a clearing in the wilderness!  They spelled safety,
perhaps home.

But we were none too sure of ourselves yet.  The big vessel loomed
over us, her gunports like a row of gouging tusks, her spars and
rigging a monstrous net poised for casting.  Her decks seethed with
lawless men, fighting and running, with harsh outcries and the
clashing of steel and an occasional pistol-shot.

We passed the cluster of boats moored by the side ladder, unwilling
to risk the time it would take to cut them adrift.  We passed the
poop, where a particularly savage fray was going on.  Men were
battering at the door to the cabin companionway and one called to
"roll up a chase-gun, and give the ---- ---- a round-shot in his
belly."

We rowed on under the _Walrus'_ stern, and there we came upon an
amazing spectacle.

A longboat was always towed astern for the greater convenience in
case there was a sudden necessity for its use at sea.  This boat had
been drawn beneath the stern windows, from which a man was lowering a
heavy box or chest, which a second man was receiving into its bow.
The man in the longboat heard the rattle of our oars and gave us one
lightning glance before he slashed at the mooring-rope and leaped to
his own oars.  The tide carried him immediately behind us, and I had
a vision of a bloody face wrapped in an old shirt.  If he knew who we
were he gave no sign.  He huddled on to a thwart and pulled
downstream with the tide.

But the man in the stern windows was not so reticent.  He leaned far
out, wringing his hands and clamoring to be saved:

"Oh, Master Bones, ye wouldn't go for to leave poor Ben Gunn as stood
by ye stanch to the end, and held the cabin door the while ye shot
the bolt.  Ah, and them ---- villains are a-hammerin' it this moment.
Don't 'ee go, and leave me like this!  They'll keelhaul me, they
will.  They'll trice me to the cat."

"Back oars, Darby," I said.  "We can't leave the poor fellow."

"And him with Bones!" protested Darby.

"'Twas not his fault."

We rowed under the stern, and I called up to the steward--

"Jump into the water and we'll pick you up, Ben."

"Who're you?" he answered shakily.

"'Tis Master Ormerod."

I could hear the blows on the door at the end of the companionway.

"Hasten, man!  We can't wait for ever."

"And ye won't put me in a livery-shuit?" he pressed

"Not I."

He jumped without a word, and we hauled him, dripping, into our midst.




CHAPTER XXIV

HOME

A chorus of yelping certified to the invasion of the main cabin, but
its note of triumph was changed to consternation as Silver's
bloodhounds discovered that their bird had flown.

"Gone!"

"The ---- knave's scooped us!"

"Boats, lads; boats!"

And presently the dick-dock of oars behind us caused Darby and me to
redouble our labors.  We drove ashore several rods down-stream from
the town on the shallow bluff, and we dared not wait to seek shelter
within its log walls.  Truth to tell, we doubted now that the town
itself spelled safety for us.  The _Walrus'_ carronades would make
short work of such defenses as Savannah had to boast.

So we pelted up the bluff by a sandy path that debouched upon the
cleared fields outside the stockade, urged on by that persistent
oar-rattle and the shouts the pirates exchanged betwixt their several
boats.  Whether they were following us we could not discover, for the
night was black as a cellar-vault; but we left nothing to chance, and
ran hot-foot through the plantations of the citizens, overhearing, as
we passed, the excited comments of the men on the firing-platforms of
the stockade, who evidently anticipated an attack from their ugly
visitor in the river.  We never tarried for breath until we had
gained the verge of the forest.

Peter was now in his element.  He could find his way about a strange
countryside by day or night as easily as a sailor could navigate the
trackless wastes of the sea, and he led us in a beeline north and
east in the general direction of the outlying settlements which
intervened betwixt Savannah and the Carolinas.  An hour or so after
dawn we emerged upon a village in a clearing, whose inhabitants eyed
us dubiously until Darby produced one of the golden doubloons from
the store he had acquired during his reign as Flint's favorite.

These people had never before seen gold, and for a doubloon and an
onza they sold us an old but serviceable musket with bullet-pouch,
powder-horn and store of ammunition, and deerskin garments for all of
us save Ben Gunn, who stoutly refused to don what he regarded as only
another kind of a "livery-shuit."  They also sold us a small quantity
of salt and flour, and put us on the trail to Charleston in the
Carolinas.

Of our journey thither I can say only that it was such an Odyssey as
the frontier-dwellers of our provinces have long been accustomed to.
To Peter and me its perils of forest and stream, red savages, and
wild beasts, were far less formidable than those of the sea, and
Moira and Darby thrived upon the experience--so much so that when at
last, brier-torn and footsore, we entered Charleston's sedate streets
and found awaiting us an ample choice of packet-ships to the north we
four were unanimous for continuing our journey by land.

"_Neen_," said Peter.  "I don't ever go to der sea again, Bob."

"Ah, who would be fool enough in his ignorance to be wandherin' wet
and bedraggled on the salt waves of the sea when he might venture the
forests and be shootin' at the red deer and the bears and the
catamounts and it may be an Injun, if he was in the full tide o' his
luck?" snorted Darby.

"I seem to remember one was all for the sea, and would wave the skull
and crossbones in anybody's face," I jeered.

"Troth, and I knew less then than I do now," he replied unblushingly.
"Them pirates was enough to break the heart of Pontius Pilate.
Barrin' Flint, there wasn't a one of them would be able to hold his
own against such as us."

"Silver might----"

"He was a clever one, Long John; but he'll be in throuble, you see if
he's not," insisted Darby.  "Too graspin' he is by half."

"I care not how much trouble he is in," I said.  "I want never to see
him or any of his crew again."

Moira, sitting beside me on the settle of the tavern-porch, twined
her arm in mine with a slight shudder.

"Never again!" she cried.  "And if it will be the same to you, Bob,
we'll stay off of the sea.  I like fine the clutch of the earth on my
feet and the whispering of the trees.  Men may be cruel on the land,
but faith, they're never so cruel as the cruelest of the seafarers.
And all my days when I hear the rumble of the surf and the suck of
the tide running out I'll be thinking of himself that lies so far and
lone under the Spyglass--and of Master Murray, God rest his poor
bones, and many another.  The sea had them all!  Ah, Holy Virgin,
what a hunger it has for men!"

But Peter shook his head solemnly.

"_Neen_," he said.  "Der sea did not take them all.  They died from
der greed dot cankered in their hearts.  I do not like der sea, but
der sea is der same as der landt.  It works Gott's will."

We were silent for a space, looking out upon the busy life about us,
the negroes in their bright bandanna headdresses, the planters
passing on half-thoroughbreds, the decent townsfolk in hodden-gray.

"And you, Ben Gunn?" I said to the steward who sat across the porch
from us.  "Will you come north with us?  My father----"

He jumped up, writhing and twisting in an excess of embarrassment,
aye, and with something of fear in his face.

"'Twas yourself was promisin' me I'd not ha' to wear a livery-shuit,"
he protested.  "And before that ye said as how ye'd find me a berth
as a real, tarry sailor-man, a-pullin' on ropes and standin' tricks
at the wheel.  Yes, ye did, Master Ormerod; and I believed ye, I
did--though there's a many think naught o' foolin' poor Ben Gunn."

"I'll not fool you, Ben," I answered.  "If you would go to sea, to
sea shall you go."

And on the morrow I found him a berth upon a Barbados packet,
cautioning him to employ discretion in discussing his past life, lest
he be handed over to the Admiralty officials as a former pirate.  He
was our last link with the infamous company that had owned the joint
rule of my great-uncle and John Flint, and what became of him or of
the remnants of Flint's crew aboard the _Walrus_ I do not know to
this day.  But from the fact that the _Walrus_ was never reported
again I have suspected that she must either have been wrecked or
voluntarily abandoned by her people.  She left Savannah within
twenty-four hours of our landing there--so much I discovered by
correspondence with a merchant of that town.

Did she put back to the Rendezvous and ransack the island's surface
for the treasure Flint had buried?  Or did she try for the gold we
concealed on the Dead Man's Chest?  Hopeless ventures, either of the
two!  As well search for a certain grain of corn in a heaping bin.

And what happened to Bill Bones?  Did he elude the pursuit of his
deserted comrades and seek an opportunity to lift Flint's treasure
for himself?  I'll swear that was his intent from the
first--precisely as I'll take oath that had Silver been first to get
his hands upon Flint's map he would have plotted so that only he and
a small circle of his immediate familiars should have shared in the
prize.  Ruthless scoundrels, one and all!  But perhaps Bones never
won clear.  Perhaps Silver fastened upon his trail and pursued him
with that fantastic vengeance they called the Black Spot.  I have
often wondered what it might be.

As to the treasure, they are welcome to it or any part of it if they
can find it.  Moira and I talked over the desirability of notifying
her Jacobite friends of the hoard that was buried on the Dead Man's
Chest, and for a time she leaned toward this course; but after she
had dwelt a while in the Hanoverian prosperity of New York she
revolted against the idea of taking any step which would embroil the
peace of the realm, and any lingering doubts in her mind were
dissipated by the titanic conflict of the Seven Years' War, with its
world-wide convulsion of nations that set armies marching to battle
all the way from the parched plains of India to the forests of our
wilderness country.

"Here is no time to think of Hanoverian or Jacobite," said she.  "We
will all be English together."

"Der Irish, too?" asked Peter gravely.

"Troth, the Irish will be the best English!" she cried.  "Unless it
be the Dutch."

But I am galloping ahead of my story.  Drop back across the
years--'tis no more of an effort than it was for us to slide down the
cable over the bow of the _Walrus_ that night off Savannah--to the
settle on the porch of the tavern in Charleston.  Ben Gunn was
disposed of; our plans were made for the northward journey along the
seaboard.  All that remained to be done was to come by a priest to
wed Moira and me; and that, it seemed, was impossible short of
Baltimore, in Maryland.  Yet at the last our luck held, for the day
we were to start turned stormy and we delayed our departure; and that
afternoon a French West Indiaman put into the harbor under stress of
the weather.  Among her company was a kindly Franciscan, and he
readily agreed to perform the ceremony.

For the rest, we rode into New York about four of the clock on the
afternoon of April the 24th, in the year 1755.  My father was in the
counting-room of our house in Pearl Street, and he came to the door
at the sound of the horses' hoofs on the cobbles.  The sun was
sloping out of the west full into his eyes; and for the time that it
took me to dismount and swing Moira down from her saddle he stood
dazed, fearful lest the dazzling light was playing tricks with him.

"Is it truly you, Robert?" he cried.  "But it must be, for there are
Peter and Darby."

"Yes, father," I answered.  "And I have brought home another."

He opened his arms with an eager smile.

"There's room here for two of you, boy.  Certes, you have but
followed in my footsteps and fetched home a wife from your
adventures."

"She is the little Irish maid I----"

"Whoever she is, she's more than welcome.  But come in, come in, the
pair of you.  Safe and well--and with a wife!  Robert, I can scarce
credit it.  After a whole year!  Peter, God bless you!  I knew with
you he'd come to no harm.  Ah, Darby, you have more sense in that red
noddle of yours than when you left here; and if you stuck by Master
Robert y'are forgiven.  What a tale you'll all have to tell!"

That night as I lay in the upper room I had occupied since childhood
I was aroused by a distant clatter and jangling which became louder
and louder.  At the corner it broke off with a heavy clang, and a
pompous voice proclaimed:

"Past twelve o'clock of a fine, bright night, and Master Robert
Ormerod is home from his captivity amongst the West Injin pirates.
God save the King and the worshipful magistrates of New York!"

'Twas Diggory the watchman; and, listening to him, I recalled how
Silver had cozened him the night I was kidnaped, and thereat I fell
a-chuckling until Moira stirred sleepily and complained--

"'Tis an ill thing if ye'll not sleep the first night we will be in
your own home, Bob."

"No, no, sweetheart," I said.  "I was but thinking what an odd bundle
of accident is this life we live.  For if that fellow braying upon
the corner had not been a stupid fool I should never have seen you
after I took you to the Whale's Head."

"Do you think so!" she retorted.  "Then 'tis you will be the fool,
for if Captain Murray had not carried you after me I should have
contrived to return to New York though it kept me treading the
highways and byways of the world come fifty years.  Now get you to
sleep!  I am none of your wives to encourage a husband in loose
fancies and romantical longings.  Your wandering days are by and done
with, and the sooner you square your back on them the better will I
be pleased.  I'll not let you forth again, and of that you may be
prime confident!"

So I turned over and went to sleep.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg™

Project Gutenberg™ is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg™'s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg™ collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg™ and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non-profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg™ depends upon and cannot survive without
widespread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg™ electronic works

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg™ concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg™ eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg™ eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This website includes information about Project Gutenberg™,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
